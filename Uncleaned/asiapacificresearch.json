Schwartz, Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao", "content": "Nearly a century after its founding in 1921 , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) again trumpeted the ideological contributions of its paramount leader .\nThe insertion into the Party Constitution of a reference to \u201c Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era \u201d in 2018 was the first time since Mao Zedong ( in 1945 ) that a sitting CCP leader received such recognition .\nUnlike Mao \u2019 s successor Deng Xiaoping , who famously pronounced that the ( political ) color of a cat did not matter so long as it caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideological authority once worn by Chairman Mao .\nNot surprisingly , contemporary observers ponder the continuing relevance of Maoism in post-Mao China.1 The discussion of Xi Jinping \u2019 s Maoist tendencies evokes a previous debate , conducted during the Cold War , over the authenticity and import of Maoism itself .\nBenjamin I. Schwartz introduced the term \u201c Maoism \u201d into the English lexicon in his 1951 book Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao.2 Tracing the development of Chinese Communism in its early years , Schwartz argued that the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of concrete political struggle rather than derived from pure theory .\nMaoism , Schwartz proposed , was a pragmatic strategy of revolution that ( in its initial iteration ) grafted useful elements of Marxism-Leninism , most notably a disciplined and hierarchical Communist Party , onto a mobilized peasant mass base.3 While Schwartz described the CCP as \u201c an elite of professional revolutionaries which has risen to power by basing itself on the dynamic of peasant discontent , \u201d he focused not on the social and economic problems that had created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on \u201c the ideas , intentions and ambitions of those who finally assume the responsibility for meeting them.\n\u201d 4 In other words , Schwartz undertook a kind of intellectual/political/psychological history that situated his subjects in the world of strategic struggle rather than in some disembodied dialogue with the Marxist canon .\nHis primary sources were the writings and speeches of the principal CCP leaders , the official resolutions and other documents issued by the Party , and the unofficial letters and memoirs of a wide range of participants and engaged observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German and English .\nBeginning with the co-founders of the CCP , Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao , and continuing with subsequent Communist leaders Qu Qiubai , Li Lisan and Wang Ming , Schwartz shows how the Party line shifted repeatedly in tandem with the changing political circumstances of the day and the predilections of paramount leaders .\nOnly in the final two chapters ( Chapters 12 and 13 ) does he address the ascendency of Mao Zedong and his revolutionary strategy .\nThe discussion of Mao occupies less than 15 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartz \u2019 s treatment of Maoism as a distinctive strategic ideology that sparked debate .\nSchwartz observes that Mao \u2019 s rural revolution was forced to deviate from the dictates of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy after the Nationalists \u2019 crackdown in 1927 cut the Communist Party off from its previous foothold among factory workers in Shanghai and other industrial cities.5 The CCP \u2019 s turn from urban proletariat to rural peasantry marked \u201c the beginning of a heresy in act never made explicit in theory.\n\u201d 6 According to Schwartz , then , Maoism originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice from the strictures of Soviet doctrine .\nA decade later , however , when war with Japan allowed the CCP to \u201c harness nationalist sentiment to its own cause \u201d there occurred a \u201c profound change in the psychology of the Communist leadership which may itself spring from nationalist sentiment.\n\u201d The result was that in wartime Yan \u2019 an \u201c Mao was now sufficiently self-confident to take the initiative in the field of theoretical formulation .\n.\n.\nintent on proving that developments in China represented a unique and original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 7 With our twenty-twenty hindsight , Schwartz \u2019 s argument about the origins and evolution of Maoism seems commonsensical and incontrovertible .\nBut that was not the situation when his book first appeared .\nSchwartz \u2019 s thesis that Mao \u2019 s revolutionary recipe \u201c was not planned in advance in Moscow , and even ran counter to tenets of orthodoxy which were still considered sacrosanct and inviolate in Moscow at the time \u201d directly challenged the reigning \u201c totalitarian model \u201d that depicted the People \u2019 s Republic of China as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the significance of Maoism as a distinctive ideology not only contradicted the proclamations of Soviet propagandists ; it also disputed the firmly held beliefs of many vehemently anti-Soviet scholars .\nAs Schwartz noted , \u201c An immense effort is currently being made by orthodox Stalinist historiography to present the Chinese Communist success as the result of Stalin \u2019 s own prescience and masterly planning .\nIt is strange to note that this myth has been accepted and even insisted upon by many who regard themselves as the Kremlin \u2019 s bitterest foes.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generic \u201c totalitarian model , \u201d applicable to Communist and fascist regimes alike , elicited dissent from its defenders.10 The most acerbic was a series of diatribes penned by Karl August Wittfogel , a former German Communist who had fled Hitler \u2019 s Third Reich to become a vocal critic of Communism in both the Soviet Union and China .\nA professor of Chinese history at the University of Washington , Wittfogel had gained notoriety in the field by accusing fellow Sinologist Owen Lattimore of Communist sympathies at the McCarran hearings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wittfogel \u2019 s view , Chinese Communism was a carbon copy of Russian Communism .\nHe rejected the notion that Mao Zedong had been an innovator in any sense of the word ; every strategic move and ideological justification that marked the Chinese revolutionary experience , he insisted , could already be found full-blown in Leninism .\nFor Wittfogel , Chinese Communist doctrine did \u201c not exhibit any originality , \u2018 Maoist \u2019 or otherwise.\n\u201d 12 Mao \u2019 s revolutionary road , according to Wittfogel , was Russian designed and Russian engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited Lenin with substantial influence on the course of Chinese Communism , but he did not believe that the Chinese revolution was merely the duplication of a familiar Bolshevik blueprint .\nAs Schwartz replied , \u201c Now it is , of course , true that Lenin opened the doors to all subsequent developments of world Communism .\nThis does not mean , however , that he marched through all doors which he opened and that all the developments of Stalinism in the Soviet Union and of Maoism in China are simply untroubled applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This early Cold War controversy over the meaning of Maoism , rather than an arcane academic exercise , was actually a debate over the future of the Communist bloc .\nSchwartz \u2019 s contention that Maoism in China ( like Titoism in Yugoslavia ) reflected a departure from orthodox Russian doctrine anticipated the advent of fissures within the Communist world stemming from disparate national experiences and attendant \u201c isms \u201d : \u201c the fate of doctrine may in the course of time have a profound effect on the relationship among Communist states such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Soviet Union which are not directly subject to each other.\n\u201d 14 Here was a prescient insight that Chalmers Johnson would later elaborate in Peasant Nationalism and Communist Power when he argued that the Chinese and Yugoslavian states \u2019 defiance of Soviet domination was a product of their both having risen to power on the backs of peasant nationalist revolutions.15 By the time that Johnson \u2019 s book was published in 1962 , the Sino-Soviet split was already a visible fait accompli .\nOccurring on the heels of the toxic Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , the debate over Maoism reflected a deep divide in academic and policy circles.16 Advocates of the totalitarian model such as Wittfogel and some of his colleagues at the University of Washington asserted that Schwartz and his Harvard colleagues , in identifying the existence of an alternative Maoist path , constituted a dangerous cabal that \u2013 if not guilty of Maoist sympathies themselves \u2013 were at the very least naive about the Communist monolith .\nIn the inaugural issue of The China Quarterly in 1960 , Wittfogel \u2019 s \u201c The Legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars as a \u201c \u2018 Maoist \u2019 group \u201d and detailed their inter-connections in a quasi-conspiratorial tone : \u201c Suffice it to say that in substance the \u2018 Maoist \u2019 thesis was first outlined in 1947 by John K. Fairbank ; that Prof. Fairbank was the \u2018 teacher and guide \u2019 of Benjamin Schwartz who in 1951 coined the term \u2018 Maoism \u2019 and elaborated on its meaning ; that Prof. Fairbank fulfilled editorial functions in the preparation of the Documentary History of Chinese Communism , a collection of documents with explanatory introductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandt and published in 1952 ; and that in 1958 Prof. Fairbank reasserted the \u2018 Maoist \u2019 thesis .\n.\n.\n\u201d 17 Even after Soviet advisers had abruptly withdrawn from China following Mao Zedong \u2019 s announcement of his radical Great Leap Forward in 1958 , Wittfogel continued to dismiss as \u201c fictitious \u201d the suggestion that the CCP might act contrary to the desires of Moscow .\nTo Wittfogel \u2019 s mind , the claim that China \u2019 s alternative revolutionary tradition had facilitated a tendency toward nationalistic independence , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive : \u201c This argument , known as the \u2018 Maoist \u2019 thesis , is historical in form , but political in content.\n\u201d 18 Chiding Schwartz and company for an \u201c inadequate understanding of the doctrinal and political Marxist-Leninist background , \u201d Wittfogel accused them of having concocted a \u201c legend of \u2018 Maoism \u2019 .\n\u201d 19 Former Communist and member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory that he was , Wittfogel assumed the role of doctrinal arbiter : \u201c The authors of the Documentary History , who created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ample opportunity in subsequent studies of Chinese thought to correct their errors .\nBut instead of doing so , they kept repeating their key conclusions .\n.\n.\nbased on an inadequate reproduction of Lenin \u2019 s ideas \u2026 and on the misrepresentation of Mao \u2019 s behavior.\n\u201d 20 The \u201c faulty views \u201d of Schwartz and his colleagues were politically dangerous , Wittfogel contended , because they undermined American resolve to win the Cold War : \u201c Their damaging consequences are not restricted to their impact on purely academic understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engendered has strongly affected opinion-molders and policy-makers in this country , and has thus hampered the development of a clear , consistent and far-sighted policy for coping with the Chinese Communist threat .\nIn this important respect , these views have done a distinct disservice to the free world .\n.\n.\n.\nThe survival of the free world hangs in the balance.\n\u201d 21 In Wittfogel \u2019 s account , the dangers posed by \u201c Maoism \u201d had spread far beyond the ivory tower , yet he looked to the academy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper political outlook , he suggested , were needed to fill the breach .\nWith Harvard having allegedly concocted a dangerous \u201c \u2019 Maoist \u2019 thesis , \u201d another academic institution would have to produce the antidote .\nThankfully , such a remedy was close at hand due to the scholarly efforts of Wittfogel and his cold-warrior colleagues ( George Taylor , Franz Michael , Donald Treadgold , and others ) who had assembled at the University of Washington \u2019 s newly founded Far Eastern and Russian Institute .\nWittfogel claimed to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital to our survival that the record be set straight , and a small but growing number of Far Eastern specialists are doing just that .\nA realistic comparative study of the historical roots of Chinese and Soviet Communism is possible .\nAnd such a study enables us to remove the widespread misconceptions regarding the character and intent of the present Chinese and Soviet regimes.\n\u201d 23 Among the many publications by scholars at the Far Eastern and Russian Institute expounding on the totalitarian model , no doubt Wittfogel had in mind above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Comparative Study of Total Power.24 Wittfogel \u2019 s study attributed the origins of Chinese and Russian totalitarianism to age-old traditions of state domination in both societies .\nIrritated by the barrage of criticism directed at him and his colleagues , the usually unflappable Benjamin Schwartz returned fire with a sharp rejoinder entitled \u201c The Legend of the \u2018 Legend of Maoism \u2019 .\n\u201d \u201c For some years now , \u201d he wrote , \u201c Prof .\nWittfogel has been obsessed with the view that Fairbank , Schwartz and Brandt ( an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error \u2019 ( not an accidental error ! )\nwhich has led to incalculably evil results in our struggle with world Communism.\n\u201d 25 Schwartz rejected \u201c Wittfogel \u2019 s conception of Marxism-Leninism as a \u2018 doctrine and strategy of total revolution , \u2019 as a ready-made science of power with established recipes for dealing with all situations \u2013 a science which is never surprised by new contingencies.\n\u201d 26 Instead of this formulaic totalism , Schwartz reminded readers that his primary goal in Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao gained control of the Chinese Communist movement , creating the conditions for Maoism to become the dominant strategic and policy line within the CCP .\nThe implications of Maoist departures ( in practice if not always in acknowledged ideological doctrine ) were , moreover , continuing to unfold : \u201c the end of the story is not yet in sight.\n\u201d 27 Schwartz readily acknowledged that in seeking to explain the opaque development of Chinese Communism , \u201c we have all committed errors , \u201d but he emphasized that his own conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the lived experience of Mao and his comrades as they groped in fits and starts toward a workable strategy of revolution .\nAs such , his empirical method differed fundamentally from Wittfogel \u2019 s theoretically-predetermined mode of scholarship , whose claim for correctness resided in a supposedly authoritative grasp of Marxist-Leninist doctrine .\nSchwartz called on Wittfogel to discard his superiority complex in favor of a less rigid approach : \u201c It is in fact high time that Prof. Wittfogel overcame the illusion that his particular experiences and his particular \u2018 theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an understanding of Communism not available to the rest of us.\n\u201d 28 Published some seven decades ago , Benjamin Schwartz \u2019 s study of Maoism has remarkable resonance today for our understanding of ideology in contemporary China as well as for our methods of scholarship .\nHis grounded yet dynamic conception of ideology \u2013as an articulation of practical strategy on the part of individual leaders with important implications for subsequent political developments \u2013 is a useful corrective to arguments that Xi Jinping Thought can be ignored simply because it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thought , to say nothing of classical Marxism-Leninism .\nXi himself presents his ideas as building on three central principles of Mao Zedong Thought : \u201c seeking truth from facts \u201d ( pragmatism ) , the \u201c mass line \u201d ( populism ) , and \u201c independent sovereignty \u201d ( patriotism ) .29 The core concepts are repurposed to address contemporary challenges .\nManifestly motivated by a desire to avoid what he regards as fatal missteps of Soviet leaders from Khrushchev to Gorbachev that led to the eventual collapse of the USSR , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 an \u2013 strives to sum up key lessons extracted from the CCP \u2019 s own experience as it has departed from the Russian prototype .\nBenjamin Schwartz was ahead of his day in realizing that Communist leaders were not necessarily more restrained by doctrinal orthodoxy than other politicians .\nBut , he insisted , this did not mean that their ideology or utterances were insignificant ; on the contrary , their speeches and writings provide critical insight into the origins and long-term implications of their political strategies .\nFor Schwartz , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao \u2019 s doctrinal deviation than the claim to ideological originality on the part of a leader whose concrete political accomplishments had made him confident enough to seek to project his and his country \u2019 s influence on the world stage .\nAs Schwartz observed in 1965 , this process of asserting the CCP \u2019 s ideological independence , first evident in Yan \u2019 an , accelerated after 1956 following Khrushchev \u2019 s denunciation of Stalin and Mao \u2019 s launch of the Hundred Flowers Campaign , as the PRC gradually distanced itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring an alternative \u201c Maoist vision.\n\u201d 30 Roderick MacFarquhar would describe the events of 1956-57 as \u201c a major turning point in the history of the People \u2019 s Republic , \u201d marked by Mao \u2019 s advocacy of a \u201c new militancy at home and abroad \u201d that would ultimately result in the Cultural Revolution.31 Schwartz \u2019 s characterization of the Maoist vision of 1956 could easily have been written of the work report delivered by Xi Jinping at the 19th Party Congress some sixty years later : Xi \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touted the value of \u201c Chinese wisdom \u201d and the \u201c Chinese approach \u201d in crafting political solutions for global challenges .\nAs he stated boldly , \u201c We have every confidence that we can give full play to the strengths and distinctive features of China \u2019 s socialist democracy , and make China \u2019 s contribution to the political advancement of mankind.\n\u201d Xi took a page right out of Mao \u2019 s Hundred Flowers playbook by zeroing in on what he identified as the \u201c principal contradiction \u201d ( \u4e3b\u8981\u77db\u76fe ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c the people \u2019 s ever-growing need for a better life \u201d versus the country \u2019 s \u201c unbalanced and inadequate development.\n\u201d 33 Setting a date of 2035 , two decades in the future , for the full attainment of \u201c socialist modernization , \u201d the CCP \u2019 s paramount leader offered a familiar formula for reaching this future vision : the Communist Party must continue to \u201c lead in everything.\n\u201d History does not repeat itself , but contemporary CCP theoreticians and propagandists do comb the historical record for ideological inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past are therefore of more than academic interest in understanding current and future political developments .\nWhile it would be facile to equate the disquiet generated in the Communist world at the time of Mao \u2019 s Hundred Flowers Campaign , in the wake of destalinization and the Hungarian Revolt , with the current disarray in the capitalist world , brought about by Brexit and the Trump presidency , catalytic moments of international disorder do seem to create opportunities for the assertion of an alternative Chinese ideological authority.34Such openings merit systematic comparative attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of CCP ideology , however , the post-Mao China field until very recently has offered few signposts .\nFor nearly four decades after Mao \u2019 s death , political scientists largely acceded to Deng Xiaoping \u2019 s famous maxim that the \u201c black cat , white cat \u201d distinction did not matter ; under the pragmatic imperatives of market reforms , the ideological correctness of the Mao era had seemingly been relegated to the dustbin of PRC history .\nIn reality , of course , Deng \u2019 s formulation of \u201c Socialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological and political implications , as would Jiang Zemin \u2019 s \u201c Three Represents \u201d and Hu Jintao \u2019 s \u201c Scientific Development Outlook.\n\u201d But under Xi Jinping , ideology in the PRC has reclaimed an explicit primacy and global ambition that scholars can no longer ignore ; from Xi \u2019 s articulation of a \u201c China Dream \u201d to his latest \u201c Thought for a New Era , \u201d the project of publicizing and popularizing the \u201c visionary \u201d ideas of the top leader again occupies a commanding place on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Propaganda Department support earmarked for the study of Xi Jinping \u2019 s \u201c theoretical innovations \u201d attests to the priority that the Party puts on this all-out ideological effort.36 Like Mao Zedong , Xi Jinping portrays his vision as a continuation of China \u2019 s revolutionary tradition .\nIn his 2020 New Year \u2019 s greeting , Xi recalled retracing the route of the Red Army so as to tap into an \u201c inexhaustible source of motivation during our Long March of the New Era.\n\u201d Xi , like Mao , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c As usual , no matter how busy I was , I spent time visiting people in the countryside.\n\u201d 37 Despite this apparent endorsement of revolutionary populism , Xi \u2019 s own tightly disciplined governance is actually a far cry from Mao \u2019 s tumultuous rule .\nXi Jinping \u2019 s obsession with Party control is more reminiscent of the leadership style of Mao \u2019 s nemesis , former head of state Liu Shaoqi , than of the mercurial Great Helmsman himself.38 Yet Xi shares with Mao a penchant to herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wide reaching application .\nEven after the stain of the Covid-19 crisis , in his speech before the UN General Assembly in September 2020 Xi Jinping unabashedly hailed China \u2019 s \u201c new development paradigm \u201d as a post-pandemic panacea for global recovery.39 Communist parties are prone to portray their ideology as a blueprint for future action , but classic studies of ideology reveal that it is more usefully regarded as a summation of past and present experience : \u201c The pedigree of every political ideology shows it to be the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political activity , but of meditation upon a manner of politics .\nIn short , political activity comes first and a political ideology follows after.\n\u201d 40 As Benjamin Schwartz recognized , when the CCP spotlights the \u201c visionary \u201d thought of its paramount leader , it is presenting an authoritative outline of what it deems to be proven practical political theory .\nBenjamin Schwartz \u2019 s work has much to teach us not only about the legacy of Maoism and its contemporary relevance , but about research methods more generally .\nHis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth claims based on adherence to theoretical orthodoxy are well worth remembering .\nIf these days few scholars attempt to force their analyses into the old procrustean bed of Marxist-Leninist Theory , other theoretical straightjackets can nonetheless be found in abundance .\nFrom Rational Choice Theory at one pole to Post-Modern Theory at the other , social scientists and humanists alike advance arguments on grounds of stale theoretical authority rather than fresh research discovery .\nWhile Schwartz \u2019 s scholarship was certainly not atheoretical , his theories \u2013 like Maoism itself \u2013 derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb , Mao Zedong once likened the Chinese revolution to straw sandals ; with no preset pattern , they \u201c shaped themselves in the making.\n\u201d 41 Benjamin Schwartz \u2019 s Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao adopts a similarly open-ended and responsive approach .\nThe 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2017 offered poignant reminders that even in heralding a \u201c New Era \u201d guided by Xi Jinping Thought , the CCP self-consciously recalls previous chapters in its eventful past .\nA banner festooned across the back wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the People proclaimed , \u201c \u4e0d\u5fd8\u521d\u5fc3 \u201d ( Don \u2019 t forget our original intention ) .\nTo be sure , the Party \u2019 s claims to historical continuity are often highly contrived , but its assertions of revolutionary and cultural lineage are nonetheless central to its identity .\nXi Jinping himself often invokes the adage \u201c \u5403\u6c34\u4e0d\u5fd8\u6316\u4e95\u4eba \u201d ( When drinking the water , don \u2019 t forget those who dug the well ) \u2013 a phrase associated with Mao \u2019 s legacy .\nAt the opening ceremony of the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bow their heads in silence to remember the contributions of Chairman Mao and other early leaders of the CCP .\nTaking a cue from those whose history and politics we study , we too might be advised at this advent of a \u201c new era \u201d to recall the achievements of our own intellectual ancestors .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email

the Causeway separating Singapore and Malaysia .\nOn January 1 , the two countries announced the termination of a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail ( HSR ) that would have directly linked the city-state to Malaysia \u2019 s capital Kuala Lumpur .\nNews of the much-anticipated project \u2019 s cancellation came as a blow to frequent travelers who shuttle between the two neighboring Southeast Asian states , with leaders from both sides offering conflicting explanations for why the rail link , once touted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loong as a \u201c game-changer \u201d for bilateral relations , was axed .\nAccording to a joint statement , the two countries were unable to reach a consensus on continuing the project after Malaysia \u2019 s government proposed several changes to reduce costs in light of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic .\nSlated for completion by 2031 , the rail link would have cost an estimated US $ 14.9 billion to $ 19.8 billion .\nThe 350-kilometer , or 218-mile , HSR would have cut the travel time between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more than four hours it now takes by car .\nAccording to official estimates , the rail link would have contributed $ 5 billion in gross domestic product ( GDP ) to Malaysia and Singapore , as well as create 111,000 jobs by 2060 .\nWith the growth-spurring development project stopped in its tracks , observers say the episode has eroded investor confidence in Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin \u2019 s government , which is under pressure from opposition critics as well as state governments who want the proposed HSR to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of a legally-binding bilateral agreement between the two countries , Malaysia is required to compensate the government of Singapore for various costs incurred in relation to the HSR , obligations that authorities in Putrajaya have said they will honor .\nThe specific amount to be paid has not been disclosed for confidentiality reasons .\nMustapa Mohamed , Malaysia \u2019 s economic affairs minister , recently stated that the total compensation costs owed to Singapore would be \u201c much lower \u201d than the S $ 270 million ( $ 204 million ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the total costs would be disclosed after the amount was finalized pending an agreement with the city-state .\nThough the compensation is \u201c not punitive in nature \u201d but rather a reimbursement , according to the minister , those funds could conceivably become a political lightning rod at a time when spending is needed elsewhere as the country attempts to bounce back from its worst recession ever , amidst a setback for meaningful economic integration .\nAfter being stuck in limbo for more than two years after the ambitious project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s request , the cancellation of the HSR was not entirely unexpected .\nKey developments related to the rail link played out against the backdrop of major political change across three different Malaysian government administrations .\nFirst announced in February 2013 , the two countries signed a breakthrough rail agreement three years later during Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak \u2019 s tenure , stipulating that both governments would take responsibility for developing , constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure and stations for the HSR within their own countries .\nNajib and his ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppled at elections in 2018 .\nThe historic change of government saw the HSR put on pause , with then-premier Mahathir Mohamed \u2019 s Pakatan Harapan ( PH ) alliance leading an effort to review major Najib-approved infrastructure projects in a bid to curb mounting national debts .\nAfter taking power , Mahathir said the HSR project was \u201c not beneficial \u201d to Malaysia and that it could cost the country 110 billion ringgit ( $ 27.3 billion ) , much higher than an earlier estimate of 72 billion ringgit ( $ 17.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn September 2018 , Singapore agreed to Malaysia \u2019 s proposal for a two-year postponement of the project .\nDeferment of the project saw Malaysia pay S $ 15 million ( $ 11.3 million ) in abortive costs .\nMahathir resigned as prime minister in February 2020 , leading to incumbent Muhyiddin Yassin \u2019 s appointment under the helm of a new government , which requested to further extend the suspension period for the project from May 2020 to December 31 .\nAs recently as November 2020 , Malaysian Finance Minister Tengku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed with the HSR in light of the \u201c positive multiplier effect \u201d it would have on the economy .\nBut bilateral talks appeared to be falling through by December as Muhyiddin \u2019 s government sought amendments to the 2016 agreement .\nAmong the changes sought were measures to allow Malaysia to appoint local contractors and consultants rather than have tenders be jointly conducted with Singapore as the deal required , and the removal of an assets company that had previously been agreed upon to supply the train system and operate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ong Ye Kung , Singapore \u2019 s transport minister , said in Parliament on January 4 that Putrajaya \u2019 s proposal to remove the assets company , which would have been liable to both countries , was the main stumbling block that led to the project \u2019 s discontinuation and constituted a \u201c fundamental departure \u201d from the original agreement .\nAs neither country had experience running a high-speed rail line , the \u201c centerpiece \u201d of the HSR project was for both sides to agree to an \u201c open and transparent international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class industry player \u201d to run the assets company , said Ong .\n\u201c This will minimize the possibility of future disagreements and disputes over the long duration of the project.\n\u201d Ong also dispelled suggestions that Malaysia \u2019 s proposal for the HSR to connect to Kuala Lumpur International Airport had stoked fears of Singapore losing its aviation hub status .\nInstead , he said the main concern was the technical issue of the HSR sharing tracks with the existing Express Rail Link , which runs at half the proposed HSR \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HSR agreement may well result in a trust deficit between potential foreign investors and Malaysia , \u201d said academic Mustafa , \u201c and may well also raise the question of whether Malaysia can still be viewed as a trustworthy and reliable partner which can rise above domestic politics.\n\u201d The project \u2019 s termination on mutual , non-acrimonious terms would not impact bilateral ties given that \u201c relations between Malaysia and Singapore are on an even keel and multifaceted , defined not by the HSR project , \u201d he added , alluding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that span trade , investments and cross-border labor flows .\nIn a Facebook post , former premier Najib claimed that Muhyiddin \u2019 s Perikatan Nasional ( PN ) government wanted to remove the assets company in order to select vendors for the HSR without the involvement of Singapore , which he described as a departure from his initial vision for both countries to be responsible for the construction of the rail link .\nHe added that Malaysia \u2019 s economy would lose \u201c trillions of ringgit \u201d in benefits from the HSR project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a railway line between Kuala Lumpur and the southern state of Johor , claiming that a \u201c crony \u201d private company has already been chosen to be the contractor and operator for the project without any tender .\nMalaysia \u2019 s economic affairs minister has denied these allegations and said that any form of the project would be carried out on an open tender .\nMustapa has said the government plans to conduct a detailed study to explore all alternatives in the wake of the HSR \u2019 s cancellation , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nState governments in Melaka and Johor , where towns and cities in and around proposed HSR stations stood to gain , have urged the government to resume the project , but with the rail service terminating in Johor rather than Singapore , which economists generally agree wouldn \u2019 t be financially feasible without passengers from the wealthy city-state .\nCarmelo Ferlito , an economist and chief executive officer at the Center for Market Education ( CME ) , a non-profit think tank based in Kuala Lumpur , sees the termination of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been one of the world \u2019 s busiest flight corridors prior to the pandemic , as a lose-lose situation .\n\u201c The future of transportation in Malaysia is rail .\nIt is not efficient or sustainable to travel within via airplanes and roads , \u201d said Ferlito .\n\u201c A cargo and passenger integrated railroad planned in accordance with commercial principles and fully funded with private capital would create a better system from a financial and environmental perspective.\n\u201d Both governments have acknowledged the benefits of a rail link and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new bilateral proposal in the future , though Singapore \u2019 s transport

will not brook such interference and is seeking out like-minded countries that have experienced the bitter lemons of American exceptionalism .\nPresident Xi Jinping \u2019 s telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday testifies to the two countries \u2019 firm support for each other on issues concerning each other \u2019 s \u2018 core interests \u2019 .\nA subsequent commentary by Xinhua speaks for itself .\nTo be sure , the CCP delegation \u2019 s visit to Nepal has a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel vision and zero-sum mindset don \u2019 t wish to see it .\nThe delegation travelled to Kathmandu on a \u2018 damage control \u2019 mission .\nThe following elements stand out : China rejects the easy route of \u2018 divide and rule \u2019 to take advantage of the political and constitutional crisis in Kathmandu .\nNor is it prescriptive .\nThe CPC delegation has instead tapped the vast reservoir of goodwill that exists in Nepal toward China to consult all protagonists on the political and ideological spectrum , including the non-communist Nepali Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a meeting on Tuesday , the visiting delegation transmitted a personal invitation from President Xi to the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to visit China as an honoured guest to participate in the historic centenary celebrations of the Chinese Communist Party next year

mission .\nHow come India lost the plot in its vital relationship with Nepal ?\nWhat went wrong ?\nWho is at fault ?\nHow can India regain its footing ?\nFundamentally , India needs to think through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment for its own development .\nA neighbourhood of unstable , insecure states is not in India \u2019 s interests .\nTherefore , regional stability ought to be the top priority .\nBut India aspires to be a regional power .\nNow , that aspiration entails India \u2019 s acceptability , which is directly related to its good-neighbourly policies and its success in projecting itself as an attractive finished product .\nTo comprehend the interconnection between all these elements , Pakistan \u2019 s analogy can be useful .\nPakistan wasted several decades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt neglected rare opportunities to make good in life , frittered away resources and lost its sense of priorities in what ultimately turned out to be a wasteful and futile enterprise to debilitate a big neighbour that was much stronger in comprehensive national power .\nSuffice to say , paranoia can cause self-inflicted wounds .\nThe Chinese mission to Kathmandu must be dispassionately assessed .\nThe Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing , On the contrary , the route India took has been bullying and it ultimately isolated India .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pampered one day and collared another day , India badly exposed itself .\nA belief got entrenched in the Nepalese mind that we are a dangerous neighbour with evil intentions , undependable and far too self-centred and cynical .\nTragically , this was despite all the unique advantages India enjoyed as Nepal \u2019 s indispensable neighbour .\nSchadenfruede , as Germans call it \u2014 deriving vicarious pleasure out of someone else \u2019 s misfortune \u2014 is never a good thing , be it in the life of an individual or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like India with a tumultuous history of moments of shame , humiliation and sorrows as much as success , glory and triumph .\nNow , there is no certainty that the Chinese mission will be an enduring success .\nTime will tell .\nSpokesman Zhao summed up the mission this way : \u201c As the country \u2019 s friend and close neighbour , we hope relevant parties in Nepal can take into account the national interests and the big picture , properly manage internal differences and commit themselves to political stability and national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused on Nepal \u2019 s stability .\nIntra-party feuds involving personality clashes , vaulting ambitions and sheer lust for power are hard to mediate .\nWhen it comes to a communist party , that is even more so .\nThe Chinese commentators have noted that \u2018 the disputes seem unlikely to be resolved anytime soon \u2019 , as the two key figures K.P .\nSharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal \u2018 refuse to budge.\n\u2019 The gloomy prognosis is that Nepal \u2018 may fall into political instability once again only after just two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merger of the two communist parties in 2018 ( where China played a role ) \u2018 has not yet been fully realised \u2019 and a split may well ensue , which of course , will be detrimental to Nepal \u2019 s political stability and the future of the communist movement itself .\nAll the same , another election can only produce a hung parliament and that means Nepal will lapse back to coalition politics and the era of defections and chronic instability may return .\nBeijing does not have false hopes .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday when the CPC delegation arrived in Kathmandu show some positive signs .\nAt a 2-hour meeting with the Chinese delegation , Prime Minister Oli has been cited as saying that Nepal and China have promoted and strengthened the bilateral relations to a new height in recent years and China has been supporting Nepal as a close neighbour and a friend of Nepal .\nAcross the political spectrum , there is overwhelming appreciation that Nepal needs Chinese support and assistance .\nEqually , the communist factions in Nepal hold the CPC in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent relations .\nThus , communist leader Madhav Kumar Nepal \u2019 s remarks yesterday are of interest when he said that a split in the Nepal Communist Party can be averted and the rival faction is \u2018 ready to forget everything \u2019 if Oli accepts his mistakes .\nMake no

.\nIt has a creative underpinning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the country can ill afford a mid-term election .\nNepal \u2019 s economy has fared relatively well in the past two years and even in the

Farmers\u2019 Movement", "content": "The ongoing farmers \u2019 movement in India has evoked strong feelings on both sides .\nThis has been praised to an awesome extent ; on the other hand very unfair criticism has been inflicted on it repeatedly .\nIt will be useful at this stage to attempt an unbiased appraisal of this movement .\nThe most persistent demand of this movement for the repeal of the three controversial laws is a highly justified demand .\nThis has already been discussed in detail in these columns ( the reader may kindly refer to article titled A Comprehensive Analysis of the Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countercurrents.org dated December 23 2020 ) .\nIn addition it may be mentioned that while these laws do not have any provision for the taking over the land of farmers , as rightly and strongly emphasized by government representatives , the overall impact of the tendencies promoted by these laws will be to accelerate the trend of farmers becoming landless which is already taking place at the rate of 100 farmers becoming landless every hour .\nThe people of India as well as farmers worldwide have reason to be grateful to the ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a timely warning regarding the real trends and intentions of the three controversial farm laws and for leading the strong opposition to them .\nSecondly the ongoing farmers \u2019 movement deserves our support for promoting the unity of people and our national unity at several levels .\nIt has promoted unity of farmers and promoted unity of farmers with workers .\nIt has promoted regional unity by promoting unity of farmers of various regions , particularly unity at the level of Punjab and Haryana which is very welcome .\nThis movement has promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has promoted communal harmony at a time when very powerful forces have been trying repeatedly to disrupt it .\nThirdly , this movement deserves much praise for its courage and determination which has been visible ever since this movement started .\nAlong with courage there has been discipline and patience , a commitment to peaceful struggle , a great achievement .\nThis exemplary courage has given a lot of strength to the overall resistance to increasingly authoritarian tendencies in India , as seen in a large number of arbitrary arrests and repression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of increasing darkness the courage and determination of farmers brings hope .\nThese three strengths are enough to qualify the movement for our support .\nNevertheless it is important to point out that despite its obvious strengths the ongoing farmers \u2019 movement also suffers from a number of limitations .\nThe landless constitute the poorest segment of our rural population and their number is even higher than that of landowning farmers .\nWhat should be the agenda for them ?\nWhat is the overall agenda for justice and equality for rural areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been clear yet despite nearly six weeks of the movement .\nSecondly for sustainable livelihoods of farmers and for healthy , safe food , ecologically protective farming along lines of social agro-ecology is most important , ( for details please see Countercurrent.org dated November 25 2020\u2014article titled Social Agro-Ecology is the Key\u2026 ) but there has been no clear commitment yet from the farmers \u2019 movement that they want to move away from present day ecologically destructive farming towards ecologically protective farming .\nWhile righting asking for removing penal provisions for stubble burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that they are committed to reducing this .\nWhile justifiably asking for retaining subsidized irrigation , they should have said that they will also work for promoting water conservation .\nOn the whole the farmers \u2019 movement needs to come out clearly in favor of ecologically protective farming for protecting sustainable livelihoods of future generations .\nIn addition it should add a women-led social reform effort to its agenda .\nIf a non-partisan appraisal of the farmers \u2019 movement is required in one sentence , then here it is\u2014the ongoing farmers \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is welcome , its main demand of repeal of three controversial laws is great , but it badly needs to have a wider perspective of justice and ecology .\nYou can not create a great and lasting movement by just negating something ( the three bad laws ) , you also have to clearly and carefully define a much broader agenda of changes which the farming and food system needs and our villages need .\nNote to readers : please click the share

"source": "asiapacificresearch", "title": "Why Are People Going Hungry in India Despite a Massive Grain Surplus?", "content": "The Indian intelligentsia has an incredible propensity to swallow the self-serving arguments of metropolitan capitalism that are typically supposed to constitute \u2018 economic wisdom , \u2019 and nowhere is this more evident than in the case of India \u2019 s food economy .\nThere are a plethora of center-page articles in newspapers these days suggesting that Indian kisans ( farmers ) should move away from producing food grains toward other crops , which is actually a demand that metropolitan countries have been making for quite some time .\nThese countries have a surplus of food grains , and so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to meet the excess of India \u2019 s domestic demand over domestic production .\nThis would take the country back to the pre-Green Revolution days , and now members of the Indian intelligentsia are echoing , in various ways , this metropolitan demand to diversify away from food grains .\nOne of their arguments is that the kisans from the states of Punjab and Haryana are caught in a \u2018 cereal trap \u2019 where they keep producing cereals that are not very profitable for them and of which the country now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provision of a minimum support price ( MSP ) that reduces their risk .\nSometimes the argument is put differently : the Punjab and Haryana kisans have to move away from MSP-supported activities to other more lucrative ones , for which Modi , perhaps precipitately , is providing a way through his three agriculture laws .\nThis entire position , apart from echoing the demand of advanced countries , and supporting the Modi government implicitly or explicitly , also shows the same contempt for kisans as shown by the government ; these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of ignoramuses can not see what is good for them , but Modi can .\nBut let us ignore the motives and prejudices of these intellectuals and just examine their argument .\nThere is no gainsaying that there are massive food grain stocks with the Food Corporation of India ( FCI ) at present and that this has become a regular feature of the Indian economy of late .\nBut to conclude from this that India grows more than enough food grains for its requirements is the height of folly .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 7 hunger-afflicted countries , according to the Global Hunger Index , can not be said to be self-sufficient in food grains even if it has surplus stocks .\nThis is not just an arbitrary judgment .\nWhenever the amount of purchasing power in the hands of the people has increased , stocks have tended to dwindle , which means that the stock buildup has been caused by a shortage of purchasing power in people \u2019 s hands rather than their having as much food as they want .\nThe solution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put purchasing power in the hands of the people through transfers and through an enlargement in the scope of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme .\nIronically , doing so would not cost the government anything .\nIf the government borrows say Rs 100 ( a little more than a dollar ) from banks to make these transfers , and if this amount that comes into the hands of the working people is spent on food grains , then it would come back to the FCI .\nThe FCI , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks from whom it had borrowed for buying food grains from the kisans .\nAs the FCI is part of the government itself , this means that what the right hand of the government would have borrowed from banks ( for transfers ) , the left hand of the government would be paying back ( through the FCI ) ; there would be no net increase in the indebtedness of the government as a whole .\nBut because the FCI , though government-owned , is off-budget ( it was not till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the fiscal deficit in the budget , which , however , is utterly inconsequential .\nIn other words , once the crop has been bought from the kisans , handing it to people rather than holding it as stocks will have no ill effects whatsoever ; on the contrary , it is immensely beneficial for multiple reasons : it allays hunger , improves people \u2019 s living standards and reduces the cost of stockholding .\nWe assumed above that all the purchasing power coming into the hands of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if a part of it is spent on other goods , it still remains entirely beneficial in a demand-constrained economy .\nTrue , the fiscal deficit will go up in this case in an authentic sense and not just spuriously as in the previous case , but this would have no ill effects whatsoever ; on the contrary , it would provide a stimulus for economic recovery by increasing the degree of capacity utilization in non-food grain sectors .\nBut if instead of putting purchasing power into the hands of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land that is currently growing food grains is devoted to some other use , then that would amount to condemning the people forever to mass hunger .\nSince hunger is because of the lack of purchasing power with the people , a change in land use , from food grains to other uses , can reduce hunger only if the total employment generated directly and indirectly by such a shift is higher than before .\nNow , even if we assume that employment per acre is the same whether the acre is devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a shift in land use will not reduce hunger , as the purchasing power in the hands of the people will remain the same as before .\nSo the panacea for reducing hunger is not a shift of acreage away from food grains but putting purchasing power in people \u2019 s hands .\nAnd as for the argument that kisans should move toward agro-processing , that is unexceptionable , but does not constitute an argument for reducing acreage under food grains .\nThere is , in fact , a very common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to producing food grains fetches less income than the same acre devoted to some other crop , then a shift away from food grains is supposed to be beneficial .\nThe misconception lies in the fact that it is not the income earned per acre that matters for society but how much employment is generated directly and indirectly through such a shift ( assuming all along that food grains can be imported without any problems at the going prices , which itself is a completely falseassumption in a world of imperialism ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ food grains to some cash crop for export doubles the income for the landowning kisan but halves the employment generated on that acre , including what gets generated through multiplier effects , i.e.\n, the expenditure of the higher incomes , then there would be a massive increase in destitution in the countryside .\nThis will lead to the landowning kisans losing their higher income since the corporates who buy from them for exporting would bid down their purchase price because of the much greater destitution around .\nIt is therefore not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shift of acreage that must be taken into consideration .\n( And even that is not enough because of imperialist arm-twisting of any country that becomes food-import-dependent . )\nIf the solution to stock accumulation lies in putting purchasing power in people \u2019 s hands , the solution to lack of profitability for kisans in food grain production lies in raising the MSP and the procurement prices for food grains .\nIt would be argued of course that if the MSP and procurement prices are raised , then that would raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a non-sequitur .\nProcurement prices can be raised without raising issue prices through an increase in the food subsidy .\nAnd anyone objecting to such an increase in food subsidy on the grounds that there is a shortage of resources to meet the subsidy bill should remember that any redistribution in society , any attempt to improve income distribution , entails taxing some to subsidize others .\nAnyone who cries over the peasants \u2019 meager income but is unwilling to advocate the use of fiscal means for rectifying it is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the peasants while actually carrying forward , unwittingly perhaps , an imperialist agenda .\nAnd all this is quite apart from the fact that what appears at first sight as the easy way to raise peasants \u2019 income , through a shift toward more lucrative cash crops , can make them pauperized when the prices of these crops crash in the world market , as they inevitably would since they are subject to wide fluctuations ( from which the MSP system protects peasants ) .\nThe peasants gathered on the Delhi border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either Modi or the intelligentsia advocating a shift away from food grains .\nIronically , it is the latter group who are suggesting that the peasants are ignoramuses !\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward

region does not rank high on its totem pole despite its energy dependence , significant investment and strategic relationships with the region .\nIn many ways , China is not being deceptive .\nWith relations with the United States rapidly deteriorating , China \u2019 s primary focus is on what it views as its main battleground : the Asia\u2013Pacific .\nChina is nonetheless realising that

for China to secure its interests .\nIn the final analysis , however , the glass is likely to prove to be half full .\nIf so , that will have significant consequences for Chinese policy towards and

Africa region does not emerge as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if virtually all of it is packaged as building blocks of its Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) .\nIt was only in 2016 that China published its first and only Middle East-related white paper , devoted to the Arab states rather than the region as a whole .\nApart from rehashing China \u2019 s long-standing foreign policy principles , the paper highlighted opportunities for win-win cooperation in areas ranging from energy , trade and infrastructure , but also technology , nuclear development , and space .\n[ 1 ] Investment figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US $ 2 trillion in Chinese overseas investment between 2005 and 2019 , a mere US $ 198 billion or under 5 per cent went to the Middle East and North Africa .\n[ 2 ] The region is unlikely to climb

Middle Eastern and North African economies will significantly contract as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in energy markets .\n[ 4 ] What turns the glass half full is the fact that the Middle East fulfills almost half of China \u2019 s energy needs .\n[ 5 ] Moreover , some of China \u2019 s investments , particularly in ports and adjacent industrial parks in the Gulf , Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean , [ 6 ] are strategically important .\nWhat was once primarily a Belt and Road \u201c string of pearls \u201d linking Indian Ocean ports has evolved into a network that stretches from Djibouti in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Duqm and the United Arab Emirates \u2019 Jebel Ali port into a near dominant position in the eastern Mediterranean and onwards into the Indo\u2013Pacific .\nChina already exerts influence in the eastern Mediterranean region through its involvement in ports in Greece , Turkey , Israel and Egypt .\nIt has expressed interest in the Lebanese port of Tripoli and may well seek access to the Russian-controlled ports of Tartus and Latakia if and when it gets involved in the reconstruction of war-ravaged Syria .\nThis was one reason that the Trump administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement in Haifa , where they have built their own pier , could jeopardise continued use of the port by the US Sixth Fleet .\n[ 7 ] Asserting the importance of the Middle East , Niu Xinchun , director of Middle East Studies at China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations ( CICIR ) , wrote back in 2017 : \u201c The politics and security of the Middle East [ are ] inextricably related to China .\nThis is the first time in history that China has possessed political , economic and security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ 8 ] CICIR is widely viewed as China \u2019 s most influential think tank .\nMore recently , however , Niu has taken what seems like an antipodal position , maintaining that the Middle East does not feature prominently in China \u2019 s strategic calculations .\nIn a webinar in May 2020 , he said : \u201c For China , the Middle East is always on the very distant backburner of China \u2019 s strategic global strategies \u2026 Covid-19 , combined with the oil price crisis , will dramatically change the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s investment model in the Middle East.\n\u201d [ 9 ] Niu emphasised that China considers the Asia\u2013Pacific rather than the Middle East as its primary battleground for differences with the United States .\nThis shift was part of a game of shadow boxing to subtly warn the Gulf , and particularly Saudi Arabia , to dial down tension with Iran to a point where it can be managed and does not spin out of control .\nTo ensure that its message is not lost on the region , China could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to job creation , a key priority for Middle Eastern states struggling to come to grips with the economic crisis as a result of the pandemic and the sharp fall in oil demand and prices .\nMiddle East political economy scholar Karen Young noted that Chinese investment has so far focused on a small number of locations and had not significantly generated jobs .\n[ 10 ] Subtle Chinese messaging was also at the core of China \u2019 s public response to Iranian leaks that it was close to signing a 25-year partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whopping US $ 400 billion investment to develop the country \u2019 s oil , gas and transportation sectors .\nChina limited itself to a non-committal on-the-record reaction and low-key semi-official commentary .\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian , a \u201c wolf warrior \u201d or exponent of China \u2019 s newly adopted more assertive and aggressive approach towards diplomacy , was exceptionally diplomatic in his comment .\n\u201c China and Iran enjoy traditional friendship , and the two sides have been in communication on the development of bilateral relations .\nWe stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance practical cooperation \u201d , Zhao said .\n[ 11 ] Writing in the Shanghai Observer , a secondary Communist party newspaper , Middle East scholar Fan Hongda was less guarded .\nFan argued that the agreement , though nowhere close to implementation , highlighted \u201c an important moment of development \u201d at a time that US\u2013Chinese tensions allowed Beijing to pay less heed to American policies .\nIn saying so , Fan was echoing China \u2019 s warning that the

.\n[ 12 ] Nonetheless , China \u2019 s evasiveness on the Iran agreement constituted a recognition that the success of its Belt and Road initiative and its ability to avoid being sucked uncontrollably into the Middle East \u2019 s myriad conflicts depends on a security environment that reduces tension to manageable proportions and ensures that disputes do not spin out of control .\n\u201c Beijing has indeed become more concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIts growing regional interests combined with its BRI ambitions underscore that Middle East stability , particularly in the Persian Gulf , is now a matter of strategic concern for China , \u201d said Mordechai Chaziza , an expert on China\u2013Middle East relations .\n[ 13 ] Reflecting what appears to be a shift in China \u2019 s approach to regional security , Chinese scholars Sun Degang and Wu Sike described the Middle East in a recently published article as a \u201c key region in big power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that Chinese characteristics would involve \u201c seeking common ground while reserving differences \u201d , a formula that implies conflict management rather than conflict resolution .\nThe scholars said Chinese engagement in Middle Eastern security would seek to build an inclusive and shared regional collective security mechanism based on fairness , justice , multilateralism , comprehensive governance and the containment of differences .\n[ 14 ] But China \u2019 s conflict management diplomacy may not go down well with the Gulf Arabs , notably Saudi Arabia , judging by what for Saudi media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the People \u2019 s Republic .\nIn a game of shadow-boxing in which intellectuals and journalists front for officials who prefer the luxury of plausible deniability , Saudi Arabia responded bluntly in a column authored by Baria Alamuddin , a Lebanese journalist who regularly writes columns for Saudi media .\nAlamuddin warned that China was being lured to financially bankrupt Lebanon by Hizballah , the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shi \u2019 a militia .\nShe suggested in a column published by Arab News , the kingdom \u2019 s primary English-language newspaper , that Hizballah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the backdrop of a potential massive 25-year cooperation agreement between the People \u2019 s Republic and Iran .\n\u201c Chinese business and investment are welcome , but Beijing has a record of partnering with avaricious African and Asian elites willing to sell out their sovereignty .\nChinese diplomacy is ruthless , mercantile and self-interested , with none of the West \u2019 s lip service to human rights , rule of law or cultural interchange \u201d , Alamuddin charged .\n[ 15 ] She quoted a Middle East expert from a conservative US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Beijing are circling , eyeing tasty infrastructure assets like ports and airports as well as soft power influence through Lebanon \u2019 s universities.\n\u201d [ 16 ] Abandoning Saudi official and media support for some of the worst manifestations of Chinese autocratic behaviour , including the brutal crackdown on Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and the repression of democratic expression and dissident , Alamuddin did not mince words .\nAlamuddin went on to assert that \u201c witnessing how dissident voices have been mercilessly throttled in Hong Kong , Tibet and Xinjiang , Lebanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culture would be crushed under heavy-handed , authoritarian Chinese and Iranian dominance , amid the miserable , monolithic atmosphere Hizballah seeks to impose.\n\u201d [ 17 ] Further complicating Chinese efforts to nudge the Middle East towards some degree of stabilisation are China \u2019 s technology and military sales with no constraints on their use or regard for the potential geopolitical fallout .\nThe sales include drone and ballistic missile technology as well as the building blocks for a civilian nuclear programme for Saudi Arabia , which would significantly enhance the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should it decide to do so at some point in future .\nThese sales have fuelled fears , for different reasons , in Jerusalem and Tehran of a new regional arms race in the region .\n[ 18 ] Israel \u2019 s concerns are heightened by the Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to limit Israeli dealings with China that involve sensitive technologies while remaining silent about Chinese military assistance to Saudi Arabia .\n[ 19 ] Washington \u2019 s indifference may be set to change , assuming that the recent rejection by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer by the UAE to donate hundreds of Covid-19 test kits for screening of its staff was a shot across the Gulf \u2019 s bow .\nA US official said the tests were rejected because they were either Chinese-made or involved BGI Genomics , a Chinese company active in the Gulf , which raised concerns about patient privacy .\n[ 20 ] The American snub was designed to put a dent in China \u2019 s \u201c Silk Road \u201d health diplomacy centred on its experience with the pandemic and predominance in the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as pharmaceutics .\nDigital and satellite technology in which Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei \u2019 s 5G cellular technology rollout is but one component seems set to be a major battlefield .\nUS officials have warned that the inclusion of Huawei in Gulf networks could jeopardise sensitive communications , particularly given the multiple US bases in the region , including the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and the forward headquarters of the US military \u2019 s Central Command , or Centcom , in Qatar .\n[ 21 ] US Assistant Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States had advised its Middle Eastern partners in the region to take \u201c a careful look at investment , major contracts and infrastructure projects.\n\u201d He warned that certain engagements with China could \u201c come at the expense of the region \u2019 s prosperity , stability , fiscal viability and longstanding relationship with the United States.\n\u201d Schenker cautioned further that agreements with Huawei meant that \u201c basically all the information and your data is going to Huawei , property of the Chinese Communist Party \u201d .\nThe same , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology .\n\u201c When you take a Covid kit from a Chinese genomics company , your DNA is property of the Chinese Communist Party , and all the implications that go with that.\n\u201d [ 22 ] The rollout of China \u2019 s BeiDou Satellite Navigation System ( BDS ) , which competes with the United States \u2019 Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , Russia \u2019 s GLONASS and Europe \u2019 s Galileo , [ 23 ] sets the stage for battle , with countries like Saudi Arabia , the UAE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is known as China \u2019 s Digital Silk Road Initiative .\n[ 24 ] So far , Pakistan is the only country known to have been granted access to BeiDou \u2019 s military applications , which provide more precise guidance for missiles , ships and aircraft .\n[ 25 ] Promoting \u201c the development of the digital service sector , such as cross-border ecommerce , smart cities , telemedicine , and internet finance ( and ) \u2026 technological progress including computing , big data , Internet of Things , artificial intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiative will enable China to enhance its regional influence and leverage in economics as well as security .\n[ 26 ] China \u2019 s state-owned international broadcaster , China Global Television Network ( CGTN ) , implicitly anticipated US resistance to its Middle Eastern partners being roped into a Chinese digital world when it declared that \u201c a navigation system is like a gold key of your home that should be kept only in your own hands , not others.\n\u201d [ 27 ] The successful launch in July of a mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s first interplanetary initiative , suggested that the UAE was seeking to balance its engagement with the United States and China in an effort not to get caught in the growing divergence between the two powers .\nThe mission , dubbed Hope Probe , was coordinated with US rather than Chinese institutions , including the University of Colorado Boulder \u2019 s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and NASA \u2019 s Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group ( MEPAG ) .\nIt launched from Japan \u2019 s Tanegashima Space Center .\n[ 28 ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t Hide A continuously deteriorating relationship between the United States and China is a worst-case scenario for Middle Eastern states .\nIt would progressively reduce their ability to walk a fine line between the two major powers .\nThat would be particularly true if US efforts to force its partners to limit their ties to the People \u2019 s Republic compel China into defiance by adopting a more geopolitically assertive posture in the region .\nIronically , the US desire to recalibrate its engagement with the Middle East and a realisation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their interests are best served by a reduction of tension rooted in an arrangement based on a non-aggression agreement could serve as a catalyst for a new Gulf security architecture .\nThis could involve embedding the US defence umbrella , geared to protect Gulf states against Iran , into a multilateral structure that would include rather than exclude Iran and involve Russia , China and India .\nA more multilateral security arrangement potentially could reduce pressure on the Gulf states to pick sides between the United States and China and would include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its greater engagement without being drawn into the region \u2019 s conflicts in ways that frustrated the United States for decades .\nNone of the parties are at a point where they are willing to publicly entertain the possibility of such a collective security architecture .\nEven if they were , negotiating a new arrangement is likely to be a tedious and tortuous process .\nNonetheless , such a multilateral security architecture would ultimately serve all parties \u2019 interests and may be the only way of reducing tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn help China secure its energy and economic interests in the region .\nThis reality enhances the likelihood that the glass is half full in terms of China ultimately participating in such a multilateral security arrangement , rather than half empty , with China refraining from participation .\nNote to readers : please click the

"source": "asiapacificresearch", "title": "Today India Needs Both Gandhi and Bhagat Singh, and the Unity of Their Followers More Than Ever Before", "content": "In recent times India has been passing through the most difficult period of its post-independence history .\nThe most sacred constitutional precept of social ( including inter-faith ) equality and harmony is badly threatened , while economic inequality and the grip of a few top billionaires on economy have been increasing like never before .\nDestruction of environment and bio-diversity are rampant , and the safeguards to protect environment after years of struggle and effort have been dismantled repeatedly .\nResistance and dissent are met by increasing repression as well as in various manipulative devices .\nIn this situation there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who believe in equality , justice , unity in diversity , inter-faith harmony and wider peace at all levels , protection of environment and bio-diversity .\nPeople have to set aside their smaller differences and agree on broader unity on more basic issues and to protect all from the onslaughts of authoritarianism , crony-capitalism integrated with wider imperialism and neo-colonialism .\nIn other words , all those who believe in justice , equality and protecting environment should be united to protect our country and its people from exploiters , whether they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , or a collusion of both .\nIn all times there should be basic unity of all forces of equality , communal harmony , justice and environment protection but in present times of fast increasing difficulties of the country and its people , in times of great disruption of livelihoods and denial of basic health and food needs than before , this need increases all the more .\nSo why the hesitation in achieving more unity and united action ?\nSome people see a divide among people desiring justice and harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Gandhiji and Shahid Bhagat Singh during the freedom movement .\nBoth of them , and their close colleagues , were all very great leaders with very inspiring qualities and very memorable contributions .\nBoth were firmly committed to freedom , justice and equality , both were able to very significantly advance this commitment in their own ways .\nBoth were also great social reformers , both fought against colonial rule all their life and yet were great believers in international fraternity .\nBoth were deeply committed to communal harmony .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people symbolize Gandhi mainly in terms of peace , which is right .\nMany people symbolize Bhagat Singh ( and his close colleagues ) mainly in terms of violent acts against colonial rule .\nThis is not correct at all .\nBhagat Singh clearly said that sometimes in exceptional circumstances a violent act may be justified but the overall and wider commitment is to non-violent struggle .\nHe and his close colleagues asked youth not to resort to guns and bombs but to work among farmers and workers on longer-term basis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on justice and equality .\nHis more senior colleague Ram Prasad Bismil left a similar message to youth in his autobiography .\nSo actually there is no great divide in the paths of Gandhiji and Bhagat Singh but rather somewhat different paths of reaching similar goals .\nIn the context of Bhagat Singh and colleagues the most central theme is justice and while the value of non-violence is appreciated , justice being more central to their thinking , sometimes violence to achieve justice is also all right for them .\nBut for Gandhiji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced in all contexts .\nBoth the great men and their followers are entitled to the rationality of their viewpoints .\nLet us also not forget that Bhagat Singh became a martyr at the age of only 23 and there was greater realization of value of non-violence in his later years which may have increased further with the passage of time .\nBut the more important point here is that these differences are not so great that there can not be more unity and united action among those who believe strongly in similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony and unity in diversity .\nIt makes much more sense to speak of how these two paths can be mutually supportive and complementary in achieving common objectives of justice , equality , harmony and democracy .\nToday as India negotiates exceptionally difficult times the country needs both Gandhi and Bhagat Singh and India needs the unity of their followers and all those who respect them sincerely to create a country based on justice , equality , harmony peace , real democracy and environment protection .\nNote to readers : please click the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on

was one of breathless wonder .\n\u201c The US government , \u201d he wrote in The Strategist , \u201c has just classified one of its most secretive national security documents \u2013 its 2018 strategic framework for the Indo-Pacific , which was formally classified SECRET and not for release to foreign nationals.\n\u201d Washington \u2019 s errand boys and girls in Canberra tend to get excited by this sort of thing .\nRather than seeing it as a blueprint for imminent conflict with China , a more benign reading is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with China.\n\u201d Looming in the text of the National Security Council \u2019 s US Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific ( SFIP ) is a generous doffing of the cap to Australia \u2019 s reckless , self-harming approach towards China .\nAs an unnamed senior US official ( of course ) told Axios , the Australians \u201c were pioneers and we have to give a lot of credit to Australia.\n\u201d Australian senior intelligence advisor John Garnaut is given high praise for his guiding hand .\nWhen war breaks out between Beijing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank .\nThe SFIP , declassified on January 5 , is very much a case of business as usual and unlikely to shift views in the forthcoming Biden presidency .\nThe timing of the release suggests that the Trump administration would like to box its predecessor on certain matters , notably on China .\nIn a statement from National Security Advisor Robert C. O \u2019 Brien , the SFIP \u201c provided overarching strategic guidance for implementing the 2017 National Security Strategy within the world \u2019 s most populous and economically dynamic region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , recognised \u201c that the most consequential challenge to the interests of the United States , and those of our allies and partners , is the growing rivalry between free and repressive visions of the future.\n\u201d Beijing is cast in the role of repressive force in \u201c pressuring Indo-Pacific nations to subordinate their freedom and sovereignty to a \u2018 common destiny \u2019 envisioned by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201d The imperium \u2019 s interests , according to the SFIP , must be guarded ( \u201c strategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic order \u201d must be promoted while China is to be prevented \u201c from establishing new , illiberal spheres of influence \u201d .\nNorth Korea is deemed of high importance in terms of whether it threatens the US and its allies , \u201c accounting for both the acute present danger and the potential for future changes in the level and type of threat posed \u201d by Pyongyang .\nThe US is also to retain \u201c global economic leadership while promoting fair and reciprocal trade.\n\u201d One of the \u201c top interests \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pure power terms : retaining \u201c economic , diplomatic , and military access to the most populous region in the world and more than one-third of the global economy \u201d .\nWashington is keen to preserve \u201c primacy in the region while protecting American core values and liberties at home.\n\u201d But there is the spoiling presence of China , aspirational superpower , and keen for its bit of geopolitical pie .\n\u201c Strategic competition between the United States and China will persist , owing to the divergent nature and goals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever the cheeky opportunist , seeking to \u201c circumvent international rules norms to gain an advantage.\n\u201d Beijing \u201c aims to dissolve US alliances and partnerships in the region \u201d exploiting \u201c vacuums and opportunities created by these diminished bonds.\n\u201d With this in mind , US defence strategy should be \u201c capable of , but not limited to : ( 1 ) denying China sustained air and sea dominance inside the \u2018 first island chain \u2019 in conflict ; ( 2 ) defending the first-island-chain nations , including Taiwan ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first island-chain.\n\u201d The document also acknowledges an untidy region of shifting power balances and increased defence spending , which will \u201c continue to drive security competition across the Indo-Pacific \u201d .\nJapan and India are singled out for special mention in that regard .\nA measure of angst is registered : \u201c Loss of US pre-eminence in the Indo-Pacific would weaken our ability to achieve US interests globally.\n\u201d The authors of the SFIP are unashamed about the fistful of principles that will maintain US power , the sort that masquerades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules-based order \u201d .\nDesirable objectives include the US being the \u201c preferred partner \u201d of \u201c most nations \u201d in the region ; and that these powers \u201c uphold the principles that have enabled US and regional prosperity and stability , including sovereignty , freedom of navigation and overflight , standards of trade and investment , respect for individual rights and rule of law , and transparency in military activities.\n\u201d No wobbling will be permitted ; allies will have to get in line .\nIndia , \u201c in cooperation with like-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope .\nIts rise is deemed essential , serving as \u201c a net provider of security and Major Defense Partner \u201d .\nWhat is envisaged is a strategic partnership \u201c underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the United States and our partners in the region to address shared interests.\n\u201d For its spiky anti-China message , the nature of the economic relationship with Beijing is hard to ignore , provided it is conducted on US terms .\nThe strategy is , to that end , most Trumpian in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent China \u2019 s industrial policies and unfair trading practices from distorting global markets and harming US competitiveness.\n\u201d In what has become a tradition of the Trump administration , the Framework document does not tally with messages from other equivalent national security assessments .\nThe officials of empire are not speaking with a coherent voice .\nThe 2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy Report by the Department of Defense , for instance , makes good mention of Russia as a \u201c revitalized malign actor \u201d .\n( Pentagon pundits can never seem to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . )\nDespite tardy economic growth occasioned by Western sanctions and a fall in oil prices , Moscow \u201c continues to modernize its military and prioritize strategic capabilities \u2013 including its nuclear forces , A2/AD systems , and expanded training for long-range aviation \u2013 in an attempt to re-establish its presence in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\u201d The authors of the Framework document are , in sharp contrast , barely troubled by Moscow and , surprisingly , sober on the issue .\n\u201c Russia will remain a marginal player in the Indo-Pacific region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and India.\n\u201d Abhijnan Rej of The Diplomat could not help but find this inconsistency odd .\n\u201c So Russia is a threat in a public document but not one in a classified one ?\n\u201d As for India , the 2019 IPSR does much to avoid exaggeration and elevation .\n\u201c Within South Asia , we are working to operationalize our Major Defense Partnership with India , while pursuing emerging partnerships with Sri Lanka , the Maldives , Bangladesh and Nepal.\n\u201d The Pentagon notes an increase in the \u201c scope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d with India .\nBut for all that , New Delhi hardly remains a jewel of defence strategy relative to such traditional allies as South Korea and Japan .\nThe SFIP , in contrast , makes a bold stab at linking the goals of maintaining US regional supremacy with New Delhi \u2019 s own objectives .\nThis is bound to cause discomfort in the planning rooms , given Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2019 s rhetoric on regional multipolarity .\nAn article of faith in Indian policy on the matter is ensuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another potential concern is the prospect that India is being thrown into the US-China scrap .\nMedcalf concludes his assessment of the framework document with his own call for what promises to be future conflict .\n\u201c America , \u201d he insists , \u201c can not effectively compete with China if it allows Beijing hegemony over this vast region , the economic and strategic centre of gravity in a connected

decade .\nTheir reasoning is clear : we need greater protection for nature , to prevent further extinctions and protect the life-sustaining ecosystems crucial to human survival .\nThe globally recognised tool to safeguard marine biodiversity is to designate a \u201c marine protected area \u201d .\nBut not all protected areas are created equal .\nThe level of protection these areas provide depends on the activities permitted in their boundaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d protected areas , no plants or animals can be removed or harmed .\nMeanwhile , \u201c partially \u201d protected areas allow various extractive activities to occur , such as fishing and sometimes even mining .\nAustralia prides itself on having one of the largest marine protected area networks in the world , which includes iconic locations such as the Great Barrier Reef , Jervis Bay in New South Wales , Wilson \u2019 s Promontory in Victoria and Rottnest Island in Western Australia .\nBut only one quarter of this network is fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only partially protected , with vast areas allowing fishing , aquaculture and mining exploration .\nThis is despite industrial-scale extraction of resources going against international guidelines for protected areas .\nSo why is this a problem ?\nOur two recent research papers show partially protected areas don \u2019 t contribute much to wildlife conservation , yet take valuable conservation resources away from fully protected areas , which need them more .\nThe gap between fully and partially protected areas Our landmark study , published today , looked at marine protected areas in southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data , including conducting 439 interviews , across five states and 7,000 kilometres of coastline .\nWe found partially protected areas had no more fish , invertebrates or algae than unprotected areas .\nFully protected areas , by comparison , had 30 % more fish species and over twice the total weight of fish compared to unprotected areas .\nWe also found partially protected areas were no more of an attraction to locals and visitors than unprotected areas \u2014 they had similar numbers and mix of users , such as walkers , swimmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , fully protected areas were attractive to locals and visitors for their abundant wildlife and level of protection .\nThey had twice as many divers and more than three times as many snorkelers compared to unprotected areas .\nWhat \u2019 s more , swimmers , divers and snorkelers said they experience significantly more marine life in fully protected areas , but not partially protected areas .\nImage on the right : John Turnbull , Author provided via The Conversation The Australian marine protected area network has been moving further away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , researchers found Australians are generally confused about what activities are permitted in these areas .\nSurvey respondents were presented with the full list of activities allowed within partially protected areas , and asked to indicate which activities they understood to be permitted or prohibited within marine protected areas in Australia .\nOverwhelmingly , they believed marine protected areas offer strict protection to the marine environment , preventing all types of extractive uses , including recreational fishing .\nThe majority of Australia \u2019 s marine protected area network allow for commercial fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .\nFewer still were aware large areas permit destructive activities , such as bottom trawling , which can destroy the seabed .\nThe research team also documented many cases where protection has been downgraded , such as the Solitary Islands and Jervis Bay Marine Parks in NSW .\nIt \u2019 s clear Australians expect the marine protected area network to adequately safeguard our unique wildlife .\nYet these findings show their views are in stark contrast to the reality of marine environmental protection .\nThere are costs associated with partially protected areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space that could otherwise be allocated to more effective protection .\nIn fact , research from 2011 found areas with a mixture of partial and full protection are up to twice as expensive to manage than a simpler fully protected area .\nPartially protected areas do have a role in our overall marine network , but they should be used for specific purposes such as enabling traditional management practices , protecting important breeding sites , or acting as buffer zones around fully protected areas .\nThe recent changes to Australia \u2019 s marine @ @ @ @ @ @

the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia : economic growth has averaged 7.8 per cent over the past decade .\nDespite the slow recovery of the global economy , the country \u2019 s growth rate was 6.9 per cent in 2017 and is expected to be 7 per cent in 2018 .\nThis is buoyed by an expansion in electricity production , manufacturing and agriculture , and it occurs despite a slight drop in

being \u2018 landlocked \u2019 to \u2018 land-linked \u2019 .\nThe construction of the Lao\u2013Chinese railway began in December 2016 .\nThe cost of this mega-project is expected to reach US $ 6

connectivity route , which was 12 per cent complete as of November 2017 .\nLaos is also working with Vietnam to prioritise the construction of a 600 kilometre rail link between its capital Vientiane and Vietnam \u2019 s seaport Vung Ang .\nThis project aims to improve Laos \u2019 access to the sea .\nBoth countries also plan to construct a six-lane highway to connect their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost US $ 4.5 billion .\nThese projects add to the regional connectedness efforts that Laos has already made with Thailand and Myanmar .\nThe first Lao\u2013Thai Friendship Bridge , which was partially financed by the Australian government , began operations in 1994 .\nFour international bridges over the Mekong now connect Laos \u2019 capital and other economically important cities to Thailand

\u2019 ( a weighted average of key ease-of-shipping indices ) was 2.07 in 2016 , which is down from 2.39 in 2014 .\nLaos remained behind all other ASEAN members in almost all aspects including efficiency in border clearance , trade and transport infrastructure and logistics competence .\nThe only areas where Laos did not score last were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laos scored comparably to Myanmar .\nAccording to the Japan External Trade Organization , Laos has the highest logistics costs in the region .\nIt costs US $ 2500 to ship a 40 foot container from Vientiane to Yokohama compared with US

at the Lao\u2013Thai border checkpoint .\nThis highlights the critical importance of improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency in order to better connect Laos to the region and restore growth to its historical average .\nHence , customs modernisation efforts are underway particularly in the organisation of clearance procedures .\nA chief example is the introduction of the UN-designed Automated System for Customs Data , which has reduced the time for customs clearance .\nIt is essential that the current efforts continue in order to boost customs enforcement and to ensure effective regulation

founder Secretary General of the Jaipur-based Consumer Unity and Trust Society ( CUTS International ) , talks about the establishment of his organization , its geographical spread , the challenges it has faced over the years and future perspectives .\nEstablished in 1983 , the Jaipur-based Consumer Unity and Trust Society ( CUTS International ) is a leading economic policy research , advocacy and networking , non-governmental group in India , with offices in Nairobi , Lusaka , Hanoi , Accra , Geneva and Washington DC .\nBesides working for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser to the Commerce and Industries Minister of India , Trade , Commerce and Industry , Minister of Zambia and to the Director General of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .\nIn spite of his heavy working schedule , he found time to discuss a few business issues with Kester Kenn Klomegah .\nHere are the interview excerpts .\nKester Kenn Klomegah : How did the founders come about the unique idea to establish CUTS International as a non-profit NGO ?\nWhat were some of the driving factors ?\nPradeep Mehta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the importance of communication in influencing the political economy of growth and development .\nA monthly wall newspaper \u2018 Gram Gadar \u2019 ( Village Revolution ) was launched by CUTS in the very beginning in 1983 which became a means for people in rural areas to access information about government schemes and programmes meant for them and their rights .\nThe wall newspaper is still published regularly and has been instrumental in providing a forum for the oppressed classes to get justice .\nThis wall newspaper , in earlier days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virulent coin shortage , medical negligence and compensation , and many more supporting consumer rights and protection issues .\nCampaigns around issues which affect a common person helped people appreciate their rights as consumers .\nOne successful campaign was run on shortage of sticks in match boxes .\nMatch box is a commodity used by the poorest of the poor and richest of the rich .\nThe average shortage was 15 % and many of sticks either did not have a proper head or too large .\nThe price of the match box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign pitched the total turnover in India which was around Rs .\n20 million and hence the annual loss to a consumer was around Rs .\n3.00 million , which everyone could relate to .\nOne of the main driving factors for CUTS International was the existence of socialism in India Other than \u2018 Gram Gadar \u2019 and the campaigns , which got excellent response and recognition , one of the key drivers for the formation of CUTS International was an amendment in 1984 in the Monopolies & Restrictive Trade Practices Act ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover unfair trade practices which mainly included misleading advertising and other deceptive practices , which are broadly understood as consumer protection issues .\nCUTS brought forward many complaints , including the matchbox case , before the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission and succeeded in many cases which resulted in pro consumer policy changes .\nThere was no organized consumer movement in the state of Rajasthan then , which lead to the establishment of CUTS , which was registered in June 1984 .\nThe second driver which resulted in expanding our work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triennial conference of the International Organization of Consumer Unions ( now renamed as Consumers International ) in July 1991 in Hong Kong .\nHere two hot topics were discussions on the Uruguay Round of GATT talks which was ultimately signed as World Trade Organization in April 1994 and the Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations .\nThere were a few sessions on these issues which were dominated by Northern Consumer Groups while those from the South , such as CUTS , from India were clearly out on a limb .\nThis led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be dealt with as they will have an impact on the developing world also .\nFollowing that , CUTS , with the support of Friedrich Ebert Stiftung , floated the South Asia Watch on Trade , Economics and Environment ( SAWTEE ) , a network of CSOs in South Asia in 1994 to build capacity to cope with the pains of transition arising from globalization and the WTO .\nThis initiative lead to the establishment of the CUTS Centre for International Trade , Environment and Economics on demands made by African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa in June 1996 to help them in capacity building on global economic issues and expand South-South Cooperation among the Civil Society .\nNoted trade economist , Jagdish Bhagwati agreed to chair the Advisory Board .\nFollowing that SAWTEE was transferred to Nepalese partners , who registered the organization in Kathmandu .\nBecause of legal limitations , they could not have a board with non-Nepalese citizens and thus they established an Advisory Board and elected CUTS Secretary General , Pradeep S. Mehta , its chairman .\nSAWTEE is now a well-established independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nepal and the South Asia region .\nIt was established in 1997 and registered in 1999 , In April 2000 , UNCTAD organized the \u2018 Asia Pacific Regional Seminar on Competition Law and Policy \u2019 in Jaipur in partnership with CUTS and the MRTP Commission .\nAt this meeting , representatives of DFID , World Bank , UNCTAD and WTO got together and agreed to support CUTS International in its first ever overseas project on assessing competition law reforms in seven Commonwealth developing countries of Asia and Africa .\nFor more please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Since its establishment , which of the marked achievements you are most passionate with here ?\nPM : Well as mentioned above , our very first initiative \u2018 Gram Gadar \u2019 was revolutionary , so much so that it reached the most remote rural areas in Rajasthan state and the response was very motivating to do more good for the society .\nThe consumer protection work that CUTS International supported was also acknowledged in a big way by media well as policy makers and led to policy changes .\nFor example the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just after the adoption of the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection , 1985 .\nPerhaps the most marked achievement has been the formulation of competition laws in nearly 30 developing countries after the arrival of the WTO in 1995 .\nUntil then only about 35 countries had a competition law , but today the number has crossed 140 and counting .\nThis included countries like India , South Africa , Tanzania , Zambia , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Kenya which scrapped their old competition law and adopted a total new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalyst for this change other than many developing countries adopting a competition law for the first time .\nAll this was achieved in spite of opposition from both left wing and right wing forces .\nSince a Multilateral Competition Law was an issue being discussed at the WTO and it was opposed by several developing countries supported by leftist forces , countries like Malaysia , Bangladesh dragged their feet .\nOn the other hand , right wing forces believed that a competition law would be a hurdle to business and trade policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place .\nToday , both Malaysia and Bangladesh have competition laws and have taken CUTS technical assistance to implement their laws .\nCUTS has also provided technical assistance to many other developing country government agencies , including India .\nOne can read more about some of the pioneering cases in our publication .\nKKK : Why Asian and African regions have become important , what directions are particularly attractive in the continent for CUTS International ?\nPM : As stated just above , we became international by working on competition regime in seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe also worked on trade policy issues with the civil society and governments in the two continents .\nFor example , governments in India , Kenya and Zambia have associated CUTS with their trade policy apparatuses .\nOn the other hand , many NGOs and think tanks in Asia and Africa reached us seeking support to develop their capacity and that looked like a good opportunity to promote our mission and build a network of like-minded organizations and also for promotion of South-South cooperation among the civil society .\nOur deep work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development issues in Africa led to being consulted by the African Union Commission and the United Nation Economic Commission for Africa on competition and investment provisions in the African Continental Free Trade Area ( AfCFTA ) .\nKKK : Specifically , what are your views about the investment opportunities for foreign investors in Africa region ?\nPM : Investment opportunities are good , it is a growing region .\nThe current Covid-19 pandemic has certainly caused a setback but that is for the whole world .\nKKK : What advice would you offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , say , in Asia and Africa ?\nPM : My advice is to have patience , things move slowly in Africa .\nThe word \u2018 deadline \u2019 does not exist in their dictionary and governance deficit is high .\nDespite all this , opportunities are good .\nKKK : What challenges still remained to overcome in your company \u2019 s operations ?\nIs Asia easier than Africa in doing business ?\nPM : We did not face any particular challenges in expanding our operations .\nI think mostly because we work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or much space .\nOn your other question , my answer is \u2018 No \u2019 , both Asia and Africa are the same .\nKKK : In what ways would you argue that , despite the difficulties , Africa is unique for business for China ?\nAnd that compared to other foreign players in Africa ?\nPM : Chinese have deep pockets and have a big appetite for natural resources .\nAided by the governance deficit in Africa , the Chinese are able to work on highly profitable ventures easily .\nCompared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there since the colonial times but have not gone deeper .\nFurther , they are also prevented by their laws to indulge in corruption abroad .\nAs far as India is concerned , it has excellent historical ties with all African countries and is providing software support in terms of capacity building etc .\nIt is not competing against China \u2019 s exposure in hardware projects , though also providing technical support to many African countries .\nKKK : Do you cooperate with international institutions , and which foreign countries are involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do cooperate and associate with World Bank , United Nations , UNCTAD , OECD and in our mission to promote consumer sovereignty we have received support as well from foundations such as Ford Foundation , Asia Foundation , MacArthur Foundation , NOVIB , HIVOS and international Institutions and NGOs such as Oxfam .\nWe also get support from government agencies in UK , Norway , Sweden , USA , India , Finland , Switzerland , Germany , France etc .\nKKK : Entrepreneurship is very challenging .\nWhat keeps you motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future vision for CUTS International ?\nPM : Being the founder Secretary General of CUTS International , I have had a very satisfying period working for CUTS since its establishment in 1983 in India , which continues until now .\nIn particular , the way we were able to connect the voices and concerns at the grassroots with the policy landscape and amplify its reach at an international level , and achieving positive changes was very motivating .\nWe were able to connect Institutions and build capacities of different agencies helping them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further motivated .\nAt a personal level to change to nonprofit work from for profit work in 1990 was highly satisfying and self-actualizing .\nFor seven years before that , I was a volunteer at CUTS struggling to establish it as a sound research and advocacy group .\nI gave up my business career to devote full time to CUTS because I realized that without full time attention one can not achieve progress .\nBesides , we did not have such funding to engage professionals .\nCUTS future vision is to grow as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sphere of trade , regulation and good governance , our three verticals , across the global South and international capitals , such as Geneva , Washington , Bangkok , Nairobi , Santiago and so forth .\nTowards achieving this vision , CUTS has initiated the process of institutionalizing its learnings .\nIn pursuing this agenda , we are a rare Southern NGO which has established centres in three regions of Africa , one in Hanoi and one each in Geneva during 2000s and Washington DC in 2018 .\nEach of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a local board with either one or two representatives from CUTS India .\nIn India , it operates out of three centres .\nAnother successful initiative was to establish an independent CUTS Institute for Regulation and Competition in New Delhi in 2008 as a dedicated

times of crisis farmers are treated like \u201c gods \u201d , but when they ask for their rights , they are smeared and labelled as \u201c terrorists \u201d .\nHe , along with thousands of other farmers , are mobilising against three important pieces of farm legislation that were recently forced through parliament .\nTo all intents and purposes , these laws sound a neoliberal death knell for most of India \u2019 s cultivators and its small farms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food production .\nHe then asks whether ministers know how many seeds are needed to grow wheat on an acre of land : While the corporations that will move in on the sector due to the legislation will initially pay good money for crops , once the public sector markets ( mandis ) are gone , the farmer says they will become the only buyers and will beat prices down .\nHe asks why , in other sectors , do sellers get to put price tags on their products but not farmers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of a 30-year-old plan which will benefit a handful of billionaires in the US and in India .\nIt means the livelihoods of hundreds of millions ( the majority of the population ) who still ( directly or indirectly ) rely on agriculture for a living are to be sacrificed at the behest of these elite interests .\nConsider that much of the UK \u2019 s wealth came from sucking $ 45 trillion from India alone according to renowned

incentives for the growing of cash crops to earn foreign exchange .\nThe plan involves shifting at least 400 million from the countryside into cities .\nThe details of this plan appear in a January 2021 article by the Research Unit for Political Economy , \u2018 Modi \u2019 s Farm Produce Act Was Authored Thirty Years Ago , in Washington DC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current agricultural \u2018 reforms \u2019 are part of a broader process of imperialism \u2019 s increasing capture of the Indian economy : The article provides details of a 1991 World Bank memorandum which set out the programme for India .\nIt adds : It states that now the Modi government is dramatically advancing the implementation of the above programme , using the Covid-19 crisis as cover : the dismantling of the public procurement and distribution of food is to be implemented by the three agriculture-related acts passed by parliament .\nThe drive is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sector in agriculture , reducing it to a facilitator of private capital and leading to the entrenchment of industrial farming and the replacement of small-scale farms .\nThe norm will be industrial ( GMO ) commodity-crop agriculture suited to the needs of the likes of Cargill , Archer Daniels Midlands , Louis Dreyfus , Bunge and India \u2019 s retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech , seed and agrochemical corporations .\nIt could result in hundreds of millions of former rural dwellers without any work given that India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobless growth .\nAs a result of the ongoing programme , more than 300,000 farmers in India have taken their lives since 1997 and many more are experiencing economic distress or have left farming as a result of debt , a shift to cash crops and economic liberalisation .\nThe number of cultivators in India declined from 166 million to 146 million between 2004 and 2011 .\nSome 6,700 left farming each day .\nBetween 2015 and 2022 , the number of cultivators is likely to decrease to around 127 million .\nWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector for decades , spiralling input costs , withdrawal of government assistance and the impacts of cheap , subsidised imports which depress farmers \u2019 incomes .\nTake the cultivation of pulses , for instance .\nAccording to a report in the Indian Express ( September 2017 ) , pulses production increased by 40 % during the previous 12 months ( a year of record production ) .\nAt the same time , however , imports also rose resulting in black gram selling at 4,000 rupees per quintal ( much less than during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed down prices thereby reducing farmers already meagre incomes .\nWe have already witnessed a running down of the indigenous edible oils sector thanks to Indonesian palm oil imports ( which benefits Cargill ) on the back of World Bank pressure to reduce tariffs ( India was virtually self-sufficient in edible oils in the 1990s but now faces increasing import costs ) .\nThe pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented \u2018 free market \u2019 trade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u2018 Down to Earth \u2019 website in late 2017 , it was stated some 3.2 million people were engaged in agriculture in the US in 2015 .\nThe US goverment provided them each with a subsidy of $ 7,860 on average .\nJapan provides a subsidy of $ 14,136 and New Zealand $ 2,623 to its farmers .\nIn 2015 , a British farmer earned $ 2,800 and $ 37,000 was added through subsidies .\nThe Indian government provides on average a

to differentiate between showbiz and politics and sports and politics as well .\nWe have failed to distinguish , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manny Pacquiao running for a government post .\nTelescoping the situation is committing the failure of properly analyzing that boxing is different from taking responsibility for matters of the legislature .\nWe have got used to always cheering for him every

domestic coal .\nExperience suggests trade tensions between Australia and China will eventually ease .\nBut in the long run , there is a more fundamental threat to Australian coal exports to China .\nData from monitoring group Global Coal Tracker shows between 2015 and 2019 , China closed 291 coal-fired power generation units in power plants of 30 megawatts ( MW ) or larger , totalling 37 gigawatts ( GW ) of capacity .\nFor context , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units between 2010 and 2017 , and currently has 21 GW of coal-fired power stations .\nThe closures were driven by factors such as climate change and air pollution concern , excess coal power capacity , and China \u2019 s move away from some energy-intensive industries .\nOur recently published paper revealed other distinctive features of the coal power station closures .\nFirst , China \u2019 s regions are reducing coal power capacity at different rates and scales .\nIn the nation \u2019 s eastern provinces , the closures are substantial .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces , new coal plants are being built .\nIn fact , China \u2019 s coal power capacity increased by about 18 % between 2015 and 2019 .\nIt currently has more than 1,000 GW of coal generation capacity \u2013 the largest in the world .\nSecond , we found retired coal power stations in China had much shorter lives than the international average .\nGuangdong , an economically developed region of comparable economic size to Canada , illustrates the point .\nAccording to our calculation , the stations in that region had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closure .\nIn contrast , coal plants that closed in Australia between 2010 and 2017 had a median age of 43 years .\nThis suggests coal power stations in China are usually retired not because they \u2019 ve reached the end of their productive lives , but rather to achieve a particular purpose .\nThird , our study showed decisions to decommission coal power stations in China were largely driven by government , especially local governments .\nThis is in contrast to Australia , where the decision to close a plant is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd this decomissioning in China is usually driven by a development logic .\nCoal plant closures there have been faster and bigger than elsewhere in the country , as governments replace energy- and pollution-intensive industries with advanced manufacturing and services .\nAnd as these regions become richer , the value of land occupied by coal power plants and transmission facilities grows .\nThis gives governments a strong incentive to close the plants and redevelop the sites .\nIn coming years , southeast China will increasingly shift to renewable-based electricity and electric power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations in China \u2019 s eastern coastal regions will continue to close in coming years , and power generation capacity will be redistributed to western provinces .\nFor reasons outlined above , that means power generation in China will increasingly rely on domestic coal rather than that from Australia .\nChina \u2019 s coal exit is in part due to its strategy to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2060 .\nAustralia must realistically appraise its coal export prospects in light of the long-term threat posed by shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Morrison government , and industry , should re-double efforts to rapidly expand renewable energy in Australia .\nThen we can leave coal behind , and emerge as a renewable energy superpower .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article

find sustainable , durable solutions to problems which have been building up over a long time , it is very helpful to keep in mind that the outward manifestation is not necessarily the real problem or its core .\nThis is very evident in the context of farming where a number of serious problems have been building up over the last several decades .\nIn many areas the seeds and crop varieties which had evolved keeping in view the specific agro-ecological conditions of an area have been displaced from the fields of farmers .\nThe self-reliance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic input of seeds has been lost in vast areas .\nIf the market provides only seeds which grow well only with chemical fertilizers and with even more specific pesticide and herbicide requirements then this has to be followed regardless of the economic costs and health hazards that may be involved .\nThese changes increase pressures on farmers to change the cropping calendar based on new changes imposed from outside , and this in turn increases the pressure for ever-increasing mechanization of farming , which is facilitated by the availability of luring credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they can afford in costly machines , with heavy payback schedules .\nThis increases costs of farmers and risks of farmers considerably , and the increasing possibility of debts piling up .\nThis problem increases with high interest rates , corruption in credit , sales of products of dubious quality , uses of heavy handed methods for recovery of loans .\nWith the excessive use of chemical fertilizers , pesticides and herbicides , organic content of soil declines , friendly organisms which keep on contributing to enhancing fertility and organic matter suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that desperate farmers have to spend more and more on chemical fertilizers to maintain yields .\nPoisonous pesticides kill friendly insects and birds , including invaluable pollinators , in huge numbers , even as harmful targeted pests may develop immunity .\nHence over a period , the factors that contribute to farming bounty without any economic costs decline , resulting in depletion of natural fertility and rising of costs .\nThe focus of technology based development leads to neglect of social dimensions of progress .\nInequalities have existed for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a few households in many villages , although the situation may be better in some other villages .\nOften there is neglect of sections considered to be lower in rural social hierarchy , who are often also landless , leading to increasing alienation and sometimes even hostility .\nFarmers often forget the livelihood needs of landless farm workers needs while going in for expensive mechanization , while landless workers become more inclined towards migration based livelihoods .\nThere are growing fissures in community life as various sections form their own wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising , there is an increase in cash passing through hands .\nIn some cases this leads to a rise in unaffordable wasteful expenditure , and what is worse , in increasing consumption of liquor and other substance abuse .\nSuperstitions and regressive trends proliferate despite the outward signs of modernity , and when frustrations increase due to economic problems or social alienation/humiliation , these can be easily directed towards religious fundamentalism , communalism , sectarianism and the followings of various dubious , self-styled godmen and gurus , or else find another kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating problems create a distressing and tense situation when farmers do not get a fair price , or get less than expected or promised price for their produce .\nThis may happen due to cheating by business interests , or a failure of government resulting from inefficiency , failure to allocate adequate resources for this purchase and the necessary infra-structure .\nIn a situation of the government having very inadequate support for ensuring fair price for all , the bigger and more influential farmers corner the bulk of the benefits using various tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the inability of small farmers to wait their turn in government purchase , the bigger farmers or traders may buy the produce of the small farmers at a much lesser price than the announced government price , and then sell it to the government in due course in the name of small farmers .\nHence government records may continue to show significant procurement from small farmers , while the reality may be quite different .\nAs the immediate problem is the denial or delay of what is perceived to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus may shift to this for getting some immediate relief , or else it may shift to writing off , or least postponement , of some loans or interest payments due to farmers .\nThis is a response to the most obvious and visible current manifestation of the problem , and not to the many-sided , complex realities of the wider , deeper problem of rural distress and crisis .\nIt is important to realize this wider dimension of the existing problems , so that solutions do not remain confined to only those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of outward manifestation and visibility .\nA much more holistic , comprehensive , deeper response is actually needed at several levels .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below

step as an Indonesian of receiving the coronavirus vaccine and freeing myself from the pandemic , \u201d President Joko Widodo wrote on his Facebook page on December 13 as the Christmas-New Year Covid-19 infection rate set new records across the country .\nWith a reassuring \u201c Safe and Halal \u201d sign as a backdrop , the 59-year-old president launched the first round of inoculations of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine , whose efficacy rate is 65.3 % , according to third phase trials conducted in Bandung , south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers were over 59 , the most vulnerable age group , and there is concern about a similar trial conducted by Brazil \u2019 s Butantan Institute which recorded an efficacy rate of only 50.4 % , barely above the World Health Organization \u2019 s ( WHO ) threshold to establish and maintain herd immunity .\nAlthough Sinovac recently received emergency approval from the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency ( BPOM ) and the Indonesian Ulema Council ( MUI ) , the Widodo government will clearly have to do more to earn public trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world \u2019 s biggest inoculation programs .\nAll vaccines must receive halal certification from the MUI to ensure they are permissible under Islamic law , an important step in the Muslim-majority nation , where it could become a serious impediment if not addressed .\nTwo years ago the council refused to sign off on a measles vaccine , declaring it to be haram because it was suspected of containing a pork-derived gelatin stabilizer used in some cases to prevent degradation during storage and transport .\nA Saiful Mujani Research & Consulting survey last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents were willing to take what might be the life-saving jab , with 40 % uncertain and 17 % saying they would refuse it , mostly because of concerns over safety and effectiveness .\nHealth experts say even with a smooth rollout through hospitals and 10,000 first-level health clinics , it will be at least 15 months before the program reaches the percentage required for herd immunity among Indonesia \u2019 s 270 million-strong population .\nThe government estimates it will need 427 million doses , factoring in a wastage of 15 % , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Widodo saying he wants that done by mid-2022 .\nSome experts fear it may take three to four years , but with newly-appointed Health Minister Budi Sadikian , a proven manager , now at the helm there is optimism that the government now has the life-saving task in hand .\nAlthough only a drop in the bucket , the three million doses of Sinovac already available will initially go to healthcare workers , business people , community leaders , civil servants and members of the police and armed forces .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 million doses of Sinovac , which is expected to be available to inoculate another 65 million Indonesians , and 50 million vials each of the AstraZeneca ( Britain ) and Novavax ( US ) vaccines .\nBut negotiations with Pfizer have reached a stalemate over the US drug company \u2019 s insistence on a government-to-business contract for 50 million doses , along with the specialized cold storage facilities to store the vaccine at the required -70 degrees Celsius .\nImage below : Honesti Basyir takes questions from the press .\nImage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-owned Bio Farma , Indonesia \u2019 s only vaccine manufacturer , says Pfizer wants to be immune of lawsuits resulting from any short or long-term side effects that may emerge during the rollout of the vaccine .\nIndonesia has still to complete a \u201c cold chain \u201d across the archipelago to handle the distribution of the vaccine , with Covid-19 Task Force spokesman Wiku Adisasmito indicating that it will be confined mainly to large urban centers .\nJakarta is also seeking 108 million free doses from GAVI , an alliance led by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation , UNICEF and the World Bank which was created two decades ago to improve vaccination access for the world \u2019 s children .\nAlready considered to be unstated , Indonesia \u2019 s daily infection rate has doubled from 8,000 to as much as 14,000-plus in the past two weeks , a direct result of intra-provincial travel during the Christmas-New Year holiday break .\nThat has boosted total infections over the 900,000 mark , with the death toll verging on 26,000 , or 250-300 a day .\nOfficials say isolation and intensive care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government implements a stricter set of health protocols in Java and on the tourist island of Bali to contain the latest surge , the worst since the

than 50 people and collapsed hundreds of buildings .\nIn Asia , a region that appears to have escaped the full brunt of the pandemic , Indonesia has the highest number of deaths per million at 5.52 %

"Farmers\u2019 Protests Reflect Existential Crisis of Indian Agriculture", "content": "With over 800 million people , rural India is arguably the most interesting and complex place on the planet but is plagued by farmer suicides , child malnourishment , growing unemployment , increased informalisation , indebtedness and an overall collapse of agriculture .\nGiven that India is still an agrarian-based society , renowned journalist P Sainath says what is taking place can be described as a crisis of civilisation proportions and can be explained in just five words : hijack of agriculture by corporations .\nHe notes the process by which it is being done in five words too : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another five words to describe the outcome : biggest displacement in our history .\nIn late November 2018 , a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee ( an umbrella group of around 250 farmers \u2019 organisations ) to coincide with the massive , well-publicised farmers \u2019 march that was then taking place in Delhi .\nThe farmers stated that they were alarmed at the economic , ecological , social and existential crisis of Indian agriculture as well as the persistent state neglect of the sector and discrimination against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the deepening penetration of large , predatory and profit hungry corporations , farmers \u2019 suicide across the country and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors .\nThe charter called on the Indian parliament to immediately hold a special session to pass and enact two bills that were of , by and for the farmers of India .\nIf passed by parliament , among other things , the Farmers \u2019 Freedom from Indebtedness Bill 2018 would have provided for the complete loan waiver for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , The Farmers \u2019 Right to Guaranteed Remunerative Minimum Support Prices for Agricultural Commodities Bill 2018 , would have seen the government take measures to bring down the input cost of farming through specific regulation of the prices of seeds , agriculture machinery and equipment , diesel , fertilisers and insecticides , while making purchase of farm produce below the minimum support price ( MSP ) both illegal and punishable .\nThe charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system , the withdrawal of pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment .\nOther demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing , the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming , investment in farmers \u2019 collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival .\nNow in 2020 , rather than responding to these requirements , we see the Indian government \u2019 s promotion and facilitation of \u2013 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture and the dismantling of the public distribution system ( and the MSP ) as well as the laying of groundwork for contract farming .\nThis legislation comprises three acts : The Farmers \u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce ( Promotion and Facilitation ) Act 2020 , Farmers ( Empowerment and Protection ) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and Essential Commodities ( Amendment ) Act 2020 Although the two aforementioned bills from 2018 have now lapsed , farmers are demanding that the new pro-corporate ( anti-farmer ) farms laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees the MSP to farmers .\nAccording to an article by the Research Unit for Political Economy ( RUPE ) , it is clear that the existence of MSPs , the Food Corporation of India , the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks constitute an obstacle to the profit-driven requirements of global agribusiness interests who have sat with government agencies and set out their wish-lists .\nRUPE notes that India accounts for 15 per cent of world consumption of cereals .\nIndia \u2019 s buffer stocks are equivalent to 15-25 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of world trade in rice and wheat .\nAny large reduction in these stocks will almost certainly affect world prices : farmers would be hit by depressed prices ; later , once India became dependent on imports , prices could rise on the international market and Indian consumers would be hit .\nAt the same time , the richer countries are applying enormous pressure on India to scrap its meagre agricultural subsidies ; yet their own subsidies are vast multiples of India \u2019 s .\nThe end result could be India becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own agriculture to crops destined for export .\nInstead of holding physical buffer stocks , India would hold foreign exchange reserves .\nSuccessive administrations have made the country dependent on volatile flows of foreign capital and India \u2019 s foreign exchange reserves have been built up by borrowing and foreign investments .\nThe fear of capital flight is ever present .\nPolicies are often governed by the drive to attract and retain these inflows and maintain market confidence by ceding to the demands of international capital .\nThis throttling of democracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously undermine the nation \u2019 s food security and leave almost 1.4 billion people at the mercy of international speculators and foreign investment .\nBut agricapital \u2019 s free-for-all bonanza and the planned displacement of tens of millions of cultivators mirrors what has been happening across the world for many decades : the consolidation of a global food regime based on agro-export mono-cropping ( often with non-food commodities taking up prime agricultural land ) linked to sovereign debt repayment and foreign exchange inflows and earnings and World Bank/IMF \u2018 structural adjustment \u2019 directives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a food-producing peasantry , the dominance of Western agri-food oligopolies and the transformation of countries from food self-sufficiency to food deficiency .\nLittle wonder then that among the owners of global agribusiness family firm Cargill 14 are now billionaires \u2013 the very company that profited from running down India \u2019 s edible oils sector in the 1990s .\nIt is not that India needs these people .\nIt is already the world \u2019 s largest producer of milk , pulses and millets and the second-largest producer of rice , wheat , sugarcane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton .\nThis is despite India \u2019 s farmers already reeling from the effects of 30 years of neoliberal policies , decades of public underinvestment/disinvestment and a deliberate strategy to displace them at the behest of the World Bank and predatory global agri-food corporations .\nIf unrepealed , the recent legislation represents the ultimate betrayal of India \u2019 s farmers and democracy as well as the final surrender of food security and food sovereignty to unaccountable corporations .\nThis legislation is wholly regressive and will eventually lead to the country relying on outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible return to hand-to-mouth imports , especially in an increasingly volatile world prone to conflict , public health scares , unregulated land and commodity speculation and price shocks .\nA shift towards food sovereignty \u2013 encompassing local people \u2019 s right to healthy and culturally appropriate food and their ability to define and control their own food and agriculture systems \u2013 is key to achieving genuine independence , national sovereignty , food security and facilitating farmers \u2019 demands .\nNote to

world \u2019 s billionaires increased by $ 3.9tn ( trillion ) between 18 March and 31 December 2020 .\nTheir total wealth now stands at $ 11.95tn .\nThe world \u2019 s 10 richest billionaires have collectively seen their wealth increase by $ 540bn over this period .\nIn September 2020 , Jeff Bezos could have paid all 876,000 Amazon employees a $ 105,000 bonus and still be as wealthy as he was before COVID .\nAt the same time , hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost ) their jobs and face destitution and hunger .\nIt is estimated that the total number of people living in poverty could have increased by between 200 million and 500 million in 2020 .\nThe number of people living in poverty might not return even to its pre-crisis level for over a decade .\nMukesh Ambani , India \u2019 s richest man and head of Reliance Industries , which specialises in petrol , retail and telecommunications , doubled his wealth between March and October 2020 .\nHe now has $ 78.3bn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wealth in just over four days represented more than the combined annual wages of all of Reliance Industries \u2019 195,000 employees .\nThe Oxfam report states that lockdown in India resulted in the country \u2019 s billionaires increasing their wealth by around 35 per cent .\nAt the same time , 84 per cent of households suffered varying degrees of income loss .\nSome 170,000 people lost their jobs every hour in April 2020 alone .\nThe authors also noted that income increases for India \u2019 s top 100 billionaires since March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 138 million poorest people a cheque for 94,045 rupees .\nThe report went on to state : During lockdown and after , hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in the cities ( who had no option but to escape the country \u2019 s avoidable but deepening agrarian crisis ) were left without jobs , money , food or shelter .\nIt is clear that COVID has been used as cover for consolidating the power of the unimaginably rich .\nBut plans for boosting their power and wealth will not stop there .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people is agrifood .\nMore than 60 per cent of India \u2019 s almost 1.4 billion population rely ( directly or indirectly ) on agriculture for their livelihood .\nAside from foreign interests , Mukesh Ambani and fellow billionaire Gautam Adani ( India \u2019 s second richest person with major agribusiness interests ) are set to benefit most from the recently passed farm bills that will lead to the wholesale corporatisation of the agrifood sector .\nA recent article on the grain.org website , \u2018 Digital control : how big tech moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means ) \u2019 , describes how Amazon , Google , Microsoft , Facebook and others are closing in on the global agrifood sector while the likes of Bayer , Syngenta , Corteva and Cargill are cementing their stranglehold .\nThe tech giants entry into the sector will increasingly lead to a mutually beneficial integration between the companies that supply products to farmers ( pesticides , seeds , fertilisers , tractors , drones , etc ) and those that control the flow of data and have access to digital ( cloud ) infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on corporate centralisation and concentration ( monopolisation ) .\nGrain notes that in India global corporations are also colonising the retail space through e-commerce .\nWalmart entered into India in 2016 by a US $ 3.3 billion take-over of the online retail start-up Jet.com which , in 2018 , was followed by a US $ 16 billion take-over of India \u2019 s largest online retail platform Flipkart .\nToday , Walmart and Amazon now control almost two thirds of India \u2019 s digital retail sector .\nAmazon and Walmart are using predatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business practices to lure customers towards their online platforms .\nAccording to Grain , when the two companies generated sales of over US $ 3 billion in just six days during a Diwali festival sales blitz , India \u2019 s small retailers called out in desperation for a boycott of online shopping .\nIn 2020 , Facebook and the US-based private equity concern KKR committed over US $ 7 billion to Reliance Jio , the digital store of one of India \u2019 s biggest retail chains .\nCustomers will soon be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s chat application , WhatsApp .\nThe plan for retail is clear : the eradication of millions of small traders and retailers and neighbourhood mom and pop shops .\nIt is similar in agriculture .\nThe aim is to buy up rural land , amalgamate it and rollout a system of chemically-drenched farmerless farms owned or controlled by financial speculators , the high-tech giants and traditional agribusiness concerns .\nThe end-game is a system of contract farming that serves the interests of big tech , big agribusiness and big retail .\nSmallholder peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be replaced by large industrial-scale farms .\nThis model will be based on driverless tractors , drones , genetically engineered/lab-produced food and all data pertaining to land , water , weather , seeds and soils patented and often pirated from peasant farmers .\nFarmers possess centuries of accumulated knowledge that once gone will never be got back .\nCorporatisation of the sector has already destroyed or undermined functioning agrarian ecosystems that draw on centuries of traditional knowledge and are increasingly recognised as valid approaches to secure food security .\nAnd what of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to fill the pockets of the billionaire owners of these corporations ?\nDriven to cities to face a future of joblessness : mere \u2018 collateral damage \u2019 resulting from a short-sighted system of dispossessive predatory capitalism that destroys the link between humans , ecology and nature to boost the bottom line of the immensely rich .\nIndia \u2019 s agrifood sector has been on the radar of global corporations for decades .\nWith deep market penetration and near saturation having been achieved by agribusiness in the US and elsewhere , India represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viability and all-important profit growth .\nAnd by teaming up with the high-tech players in Silicon Valley , multi-billion dollar data management markets are being created .\nFrom data and knowledge to land , weather and seeds , capitalism is compelled to eventually commodify ( patent and own ) all aspects of life and nature .\nForeign agricapital is applying enormous pressure on India to scrap its meagre ( in comparison to the richer nations ) agricultural subsidies .\nThe public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks constitute an obstacle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such interests require India to become dependent on imports ( alleviating the overproduction problem of Western agricapital \u2013 the vast stocks of grains that it already dumps on the Global South ) and to restructure its own agriculture for growing crops ( fruit , vegetables ) that consumers in the richer countries demand .\nInstead of holding physical buffer stocks for its own use , India would hold foreign exchange reserves and purchase food stocks from global traders .\nSuccessive administrations have made the country dependent on volatile flows of foreign capital via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe fear of capital flight is ever present .\nPolicies are often governed by the drive to attract and retain these inflows .\nThis financialisation of agriculture serves to undermine the nation \u2019 s food security , placing it at the mercy of unforeseen global events ( conflict , oil prices , public health crises ) international commodity speculators and unstable foreign investment .\nCurrent agricultural \u2018 reforms \u2019 are part of a broader process of imperialism \u2019 s increasing capture of the Indian economy , which has led to its recolonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberalisation which began in 1991 .\nBy reducing public sector buffer stocks and introducing corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce , India will be sacrificing its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of unscrupulous billionaires .\nAs independent cultivators are bankrupted , the aim is that land will eventually be amalgamated to facilitate large-scale industrial cultivation .\nIndeed , a recent piece on the Research Unit for Political Economy site , \u2018 The Kisans Are Right : Their Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian government is ascertaining which land is owned by whom with the ultimate aim of making it easier to eventually sell it off ( to foreign investors and agribusiness ) .\nOther developments are also part of the plan ( such as the Karnataka Land Reform Act ) , which will make it easier for business to purchase agricultural land .\nIndia could eventually see institutional investors with no connection to farming ( pension funds , sovereign wealth funds , endowment funds and investments from governments , banks , insurance companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is an increasing trend globally and , again , India represents a huge potential market .\nThe funds have no connection to farming , have no interest in food security and are involved just to make profit from land .\nThe recent farm bills \u2013 if not repealed \u2013 will impose the neoliberal shock therapy of dispossession and dependency , finally clearing the way to restructure the agri-food sector .\nThe massive inequalities and injustices that have resulted from the COVID-related lockdowns are a mere taste of what is to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been on the streets protesting against these bills are at the vanguard of the pushback \u2013 they can not afford to fail .\nThere is too much at stake

\u2019 s message remains highly relevant today , 73 years after the assassination of this man of peace .\nGandhi \u2019 s work and writings covered a very wide range of activities , but perhaps what present-day world needs to learn most from Gandhi is his overwhelming emphasis on non-violence to resolve any conflict or to confront any injustice .\nMore than that , he emphasised non-violence as an entire way of life , emphasising its importance in our daily life ( even relationships within family ) as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom .\nNon-violence ( ahimsa ) for Gandhi is all-encompassing , bringing in its range not only all human beings but also all forms of life .\nNon-violence in action is considered far from adequate \u2013 it should extend to our innermost thoughts .\nGandhi \u2019 s concept of non-violence is so pervasive that it will not only help the cause of world peace \u2013 rightly practiced it \u2019 ll help to significantly bring down the incidence of domestic violence and mental stress as well .\nThe movement for animal rights or compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider spread of Gandhi \u2019 s ideas .\nAbout the role of non-violence in his own life , Gandhi wrote Gandhi had big hopes from harnessing the tremendous force of non-violence .\nHe wrote , ( Harijan 10.12.38 p. 377 ) \u201c more powerful than all the armaments , non-violence is a unique force that has come into the world \u201d .\nElsewhere he said The path of non-violence is noble , but it is not easy .\nAs Gandhi says ( Harijan 14.5.38 ) A votary of Ahimsa has to be incorruptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truthful , straightforward and utterly selfless .\nHe must have also true humility .\n( Harijan , 20.5.39 , p.133 ) \u201c The very first step in non-violence is that we cultivate in our daily life , as between ourselves , truthfulness , humility , tolerance , loving kindness .\nHonesty , they say in English , is the best policy .\nBut in terms of non-violence , it is not mere policy .\nPolicies may and do change .\nNon violence is an unchangeable creed .\nIt has to be pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( Harijan , 2.4.38 , p. 65 ) \u201c Non-violence , to be a potent force , must begin with the mind .\n( Young India , 2-4-31 , p. 58 ) \u201c \u2026unless there is a hearty co-operation of the mind the mere outward observance will be simply a mask , harmful both to the man himself and to others .\nThe perfect state is reached only when mind and body and speech are in proper co-ordination .\n( Young India , 1.10.31 , p. 287 ) \u201c The alphabet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and I can say from experience that , if we secure success there , we are sure to do so everywhere else.\n\u201d ( Harijan 21.7.40 , p. 214 ) \u201c If one does not practice non-violence in one \u2019 s personal relations with others and hopes to use it in bigger affairs , one is vastly mistaken .\nNon-violence , like charity , must begin at home .\n( Harijan , 28-1-39 , p. 441 ) Gandhi captured the spirit of non-violent struggle in the following words \u2013 For Gandhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was absolutely no room in his thinking for religious differences turning violent .\nHe wrote , \u201c I believe in the fundamental truth of all great religions of the world .\nI believe that they are all God given , and I believe that they were necessary for the people to whom these religions were revealed .\nAnd I believe that , if only we could all of us read the scriptures of different faiths from the standpoint of the followers of those faiths we should find that they were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another.\n\u201d ( Harijan 16.2.34 P.5-6 ) Gandhi saw clearly that the aggressiveness of the great powers is rooted in greed .\nHe said world peace \u201c is clearly impossible without the great powers of the earth renouncing their imperialistic designs .\nThis again seems impossible without these great nations ceasing to believe in soul-destroying competition and to desire to multiply wants and therefore increase their material possessions .\n( Harijan 16.5.36 P.109 ) The ideal he urged to his own countrymen was \u201c we will exploit none just as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Young India 16.4.31 page-9 ) .\nHe added \u201c I should reject that patriotism which sought to mount upon the distress or the exploitation of other nationalities.\n\u201d In fact Gandhi was an internationalist much ahead of his times .\nHe wrote , \u201c The better mind of the world desires today not absolutely independent States warring one against another , but a federation of friendly inter-dependent States .\n( Young India , 26-12-24 , p. 425 ) \u2018 The structure of a world federation can be raised only on foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be totally given up in world affairs .\n( Gandhiji \u2019 s Correspondence with the Goverenment \u2013 1942-44 , ( 1957 ) , p. 143 ) \u2018 Federation is undoubtely a greater and nobler end for free nations .\nIt is a greater and nobler end for them to strive to promote Federation than be self-centred , seeking only to preserve their own freedom .\n( Harijan , 9-8-42 , p. 265 ) Speaking optimistically of his vision of a future world he wrote , \u201c The world of tomorrow will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-violence .\nThat is the first law : out of it all other blessings will flow .\n\u201c \u2026 An individual can adopt the way of life of the future \u2013 the non-violent way \u2013 without having to wait for others to do so .\nAnd if an individual can do it , can not whole groups of individuals ?\nWhole nations ?\nMen often hesitate to make a beginning , because they feel that the objective can not be achieved in its entirety .\nThis attitude of mind is precisely our greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each man , if he only wills it , can clear away .\n\u201c \u2026Equal distribution \u2013 the second great law of tomorrow \u2019 s world as I see it \u2013 grows out of non-violence .\nIt implies not that the world \u2019 s goods shall be arbitrarily divided up , but that each man shall have the wherewithal to supply his natural needs , no more .\n( The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi , PP 458-60 ) .\n\u201c \u2026only truthful , non-violent and pure hearted socialists will be able to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world.. \u201d So what we see in his vision is a socialist society based on non-violence .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons

colony that was itself an act of invasion rather than settlement ; the theft of land and its rapacious plunder .\nEven some of the rough colonists were not oblivious to such a crude record .\nHenry Parkes , in planning the Centenary celebrations as New South Wales premier in 1888 , was asked by a fellow politician what he would be doing for the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed citizens had been promised a banquet of much quaffing and gorging .\nAs a gesture , Parkes considered the distribution of food parcels .\n\u201c Then we ought to do something for the Aborigines , \u201d came the response .\nThe answer from the premier was coldly revealing : \u201c And remind them that we have robbed them ?\n\u201d But the use of such language is frowned upon by flag waving brigades advocating uplift and encouragement , those who can only ever babble about the exceptional country , the remarkable social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplant that found itself at the other side of the earth .\nGenerally speaking , Australia Day is not exactly one of patriotic feverishness .\nAs the BBC describes it , Australians tend to mark the occasion more as \u201c a late summer festival than a solemn national day its founders intended it to be \u201d .\nThe more serious ones find time to acknowledge such words as \u201c a fair go \u201d and \u201c mateship \u201d , along with \u201c democracy \u201d and \u201c freedom \u201d .\nFor the most part the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commemorating January 26 , 1788 when Captain Arthur Phillip took formal possession of the land that would become the colony of New South Wales .\nThe British flag was raised in Sydney Cove , if only because sources of fresh water had been identified .\nThe actual date of the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay was a week prior .\nAnd so , deceptions are born and lies established .\nBy 1935 , January 26 came to be known as Australia Day in all states bar New South Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c Anniversary Day \u201d .\nThree years later , various Indigenous groups sought a different title : January 26 would be known as a Day of Mourning and Protest .\nVictorian Aboriginal activist William Cooper saw little reason to dissemble : the day the British arrived was a memorial to the death of the Aboriginal people .\nIn recent years , the casualness has come off the gloss of the occasion .\nThere have been campaigns launched to Save Australia Day , spearheaded by Mark Latham , former federal Labor opposition leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenters in the country .\nIn 2018 , Latham \u2019 s effort involved television , radio and social media advertisements fearful of an Orwellian future of censorship .\n\u201c In an environment where you have so much political correctness , where certain words , themes and values are banned in public institutions , I think the Big Brother approach , that dystopian theme , is very appropriate.\n\u201d Latham \u2019 s sentiment here that a history focused on the grim and the brutal is not constructive , being merely conducive to morbid reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in the 19th and 20th centuries , no one \u2019 s wiping that history away , but we can \u2019 t rewrite that history.\n\u201d Nor speak of it , it would seem .\nThe national broadcaster , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , has also found itself thickly involved in such disputes of title , despite pretending not to be .\nIn attempting to keep an open church on terminology , the organisation has managed to aggravate all concerned .\nAs the network says in a statement , \u201c Australia Day \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c We also recognise and respect that community members use other terms for the event , including \u2018 26 January \u2019 , \u2018 Invasion Day \u2019 and \u2018 Survival Day \u2019 , so our reporting and coverage reflect that.\n\u201d Prior to this year \u2019 s coverage of Australia Day events , the ABC felt the need to clarify its position after suggesting that the terms were flexible and elastic in their deployment .\n\u201c Given the variety of terms in use , and the different perspectives on the day that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the long weekend , it would be inappropriate to mandate staff use any one term over others in all contexts.\n\u201d That need for clarification was driven by criticisms over an article published by the network originally titled \u201c Australia Day/Invasion Day 2021 events for Sydney , Melbourne , Canberra , Brisbane , Perth , Adelaide , Hobart and Darwin.\n\u201d This was less than pleasing to the Communications Minister Paul Fletcher , who represents a conservative government already cranky with various news reports from the organisation .\nThe ABC had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in referencing both terms for the day and presuming them to be interchangeable .\n\u201c The name of Australia Day is reflected in legislation across Australia .\nMore important , it is reflected in the usage of the overwhelming majority of Australia.\n\u201d The pro-market , libertarian Institute of Public Affairs was also livid , and had some advice for Prime Minister Scott Morrison .\nThe government , suggested IPA communications director Evan Mulholland , could \u201c refuse to fund a public broadcaster that doesn \u2019 t respect Australian values.\n\u201d In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toyed with a moral argument .\n\u201c If Australia

scholars have questioned and tried to define the significance and concepts of these clashing initiatives , there is no consensus on what exactly these concepts mean in theory and practice .\nOfficial

Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 , proclaims \u2018 peaceful development \u2019 and \u2018 economic cooperation \u2019 through regional connectivity across Asia , Europe , and Africa .\n( Office of the Leading Group for the Belt and Road Initiative , 2017 ) The Initiative is based on the five conceptual pillars of policy coordination , facilitating connectivity , unimpeded trade , financial integration , and people-to-people exchanges .\nThese pillars are linked to the Sustainable Development Goals that were adopted by the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Since its initiation , the BRI has been the object of analysis and debate .\nInterpretations range from seeing the BRI as a Chinese version of the \u201c Marshall Plan \u201d designed to expand economic development as well as China \u2019 s sphere of influence and as a way to transfer Chinese excess production capacity abroad ( Simon Shen , 2016 ) , to describing it as \u201c the new phase of globalization integrating the inland and

projects across various countries and regions , there is no clear definition .\nHowever , the concept of \u2018 corridor \u2019 comes from issues related to trade and accessibility problems affecting

spur economic development in the defined geographical area .\n( Hans-Peter Brunner , 2013 ) Indeed , the Corridor envisaged under the BRI is a broad concept that goes beyond road building .\nThe BRI encompasses the following six economic corridors : \u201c the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Corridor \u201d , \u201c China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic

, which involves high-speed rail and road links between Moscow and Beijing .\nFollowing this , the three countries signed a Memorandum-of-Understanding ( MoU ) to build an \u201c Economic Corridor \u201d on the basis of their respective development strategies during the trilateral meeting in Ufa , Russia in 2015 .\nIn 2016 , China , Mongolia , and Russia signed a trilateral agreement to build an economic corridor on the sidelines of the 16th summit of the Council of Heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs \u2018 The Diplomat \u2019 remarked at the time , instead of focusing on the Shanghai Cooperation Organization agenda , the members and guests used this opportunity to settle trilateral issues .\nThe origin of this Mongolia-Russia-China \u2018 trilateralism \u2019 can be traced back to the post-Ukrainian crisis and the rapprochement between China and Russia in 2014 .\nWhile Russia has had to shift its economy towards China due to the sanctions imposed from the West after the annexation of Crimea , Mongolia sought a \u2018 trilateralism \u2019 strategy to prevent being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurasian Silk Road .\nIt is in Mongolia \u2019 s interest not only to promote Mongolia as \u2018 a reliable and cheaper \u2018 Economic Corridor \u2019 for Sino-Russian transit traffic across Eurasia \u2019 but also to increase Russia \u2019 s investment in Mongolia , building a transport infrastructure that would connect with the Trans-Siberian rail system and further with China and the Asia-Pacific .\n( Alicia Campi , 2020 ) Prospects of Mongolia \u2019 s \u2018 Steppe Road \u2019 project under the CMREC Within the scope of the BRI , among the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongolia selected 32 projects for advancing its development priorities .\nThe projects are in various fields such as transportation and infrastructure ( railway , logistics , road , and telecommunication ) , industrial sector , development of border-crossing points , energy sector , facilitation of trade and inspection procedures , environment and energy , education , science , and technology cooperation , humanitarian , agriculture and medical science .\nAmong these projects , more than one third ( 13 ) involve transportation infrastructure as regional connectivity is the main target of the initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that basis , in 2014 , the Government of Mongolia came up with a plan called a \u201c Steppe Road \u201d ( in Mongolian , \u2018 \u0422\u0430\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0417\u0430\u043c \u2019 ) project to use their geographical location to connect Asia and Europe .\nThe goal is to create a favorable political and economic environment with their two neighbors and for the landlocked nation to export its products to third markets through their territories .\nThe project involves building roads , railways , oil and gas pipelines , and power lines , and connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn other words , the idea is to build trade and economic cooperation between the two neighbors using Mongolia as a \u2018 bridge \u2019 over land and an important transit corridor between Asia and Europe .\nIn the same year , Russia signed a 30-year gas deal with China ( effective from 2018 ) worth 400 billion US dollars amid its worsened relations with the western countries .\nAlthough the two countries initially planned to build a 4000 kilometer gas pipeline , the Russian side also expressed interest in exporting its natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mongolian authorities as it would allow it to export its natural gas through this channel .\nLater , the Ministry of Economic Development ( dissolved in 2014 ) which calculated that through Mongolia it would only require a 1500 kilometer gas pipeline .\nIn September 2014 , the then Mongolian Prime Minister Norov Altankhuyag conveyed Mongolia \u2019 s interest in serving as a \u2018 bridge \u2019 between China and Russia during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Saint-Petersburg .\nShortly afterward , the Government of Mongolia established a working group on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.Shadavdolgor , 2016 ) .\nThe Mongolian-proposed \u2018 Steppe Road \u2019 project involves railway , railroad , power line , oil and gas pipeline projects .\nUnder the railway project , the aim is to upgrade the Trans-Mongolian railway corridor in conjunction with the railway capacity of its two neighbors .\nWith regard to the railroad plan , the goal is to build three vertical and three horizontal tunnels .\nMongolian planners estimate that reaching Eastern Europe through Mongolia takes ten fewer days while it takes more than a month to reach Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Batbaatar , 2015 ) Also , as the Asian Highway ( AH ) passes through Mongolia , it would create favorable conditions for the implementation of related road projects .\nIn turn , this would not only contribute to infrastructure development such as trade and logistics centers in Mongolia but also serve as a \u2018 bridge \u2019 connecting two continents .\nAnother important Steppe Road project is a power line .\nWith the increasing energy consumption of the three countries , energy cooperation and building an energy system is a priority .\nChina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy not just in the region but globally .\nAlthough most of China \u2019 s energy is coal based , it has recently been exploring solar and wind renewable alternatives .\nRussia and Mongolia are major energy suppliers to their southern neighbor .\nThis is also true for the oil pipeline project .\nBoth Mongolia and Russia have oil reserves and Russia supplies oil to China via Manchuria .\nBuilding a pipeline in Mongolia would allow both countries to export oil and natural gas to China .\nIn 2017 , the Chinese and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on BRI cooperation during the first Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing .\nThis was followed by a cooperation plan for promoting the BRI with Mongolia \u2019 s \u2018 Steppe Road \u2019 program in April 2019 during a state visit of Mongolian President Khaltmaa Battulga to Beijing ( China Global Television Network , 2019 ) .\nIn the same year , the President of Mongolia urged its two partners to accelerate construction of a network of cross-border highways , facilitate customs clearance , strengthen energy cooperation , and discuss the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of presidents of Russia , Mongolia , and China .\nAccording to ( Gal Luft , 2017 ) trade between China and Mongolia currently follows two routes : ( 1 ) 1,200-mile from Ulaanbaatar to the Port of Tianjin ( passing through Erenhot in Inner Mongolia ) and ( 2 ) a 1,400-mile route from Choibalsan ( eastern Mongolia ) to the Port of Dalian through Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia .\nThe plan under the CMREC is to build high-speed rail and road , the first to connect the Bohai Bay Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region ) to Russia via Hohhot ( Inner Mongolia ) and the second from Dalian to Chita in Russia via Shenyang , Changchun , Harbin and Manzhouli .\nAccording to some sources , this would allow the cargo to reach Western Europe three times faster than by sea ) ( \u0416.\u0413\u04e9\u043b\u0433\u04e9\u04e9 , \u0411.\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 2017 ) with the Mongolian cargo routed through Qinhuangdao , the world \u2019 s largest coal export port in China .\n( Gal Luft , 2017 ) Other proposed rail projects under the CMREC such as connecting Tavan Tolgoi ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untapped coking and thermal coal deposits , located in the Omnogovi Province in southern Mongolia ) to the Chinese border have slowed for now due to lack of funding and other external factors .\nJudging from the projects launched in Mongolia under the BRI , the majority of proposed projects are related to transportation infrastructure and the railway projects are related to mining .\nThis is also the case in Russia ( the Far East and East Siberian regions ) .\nIn the Mongolian case , while mining and enrichment will take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transported to China .\nComing to transit points , the capital , Ulaanbaatar , is identified as the main transit point in Mongolia , but the Altai ( Gobi-Altai ) city in Western Mongolia is also listed as a conditional junction point of the Chuya Highway ( also known as Russian route R256 in Novosibirsk Oblast , Altai Krai and Altai Republic of Russia ) with a potential road from Kyzyl in Russia .\nOn Russian territory , Yekaterinburg is identified as the endpoint connecting all routes from China to the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taishet , Ulan-Ude , Kyzyl , and Chita .\n( See map ) These Russian cities are listed as potential future hubs of transshipment logistics centers and cargo-forming areas from and to China .\nFrom a Mongolian perspective , the construction of railways and roads would improve its infrastructure and open new opportunities to export its products to Europe through Russia .\nMongolia \u2019 s main exports are copper , coal , gold as well as cashmere and animal products such as meat and wool .\nIts main imports are refined petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with machinery and equipment , cars , and consumer goods .\nRussia is the main supplier of Mongolia \u2019 s power and energy and about 80 percent of Mongolia \u2019 s oil .\nHowever , almost half of its total external trade is with China , which receives more than 90 percent of Mongolia \u2019 s exports ( mainly , natural resources such as iron ore , copper and gold ) .\nAlso , revenue from transit fees could contribute to economic growth .\nIn short , the establishment of the Corridor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three countries .\nFrom a Russian perspective , this would not only contribute to its domestic socio-economic development using the natural resources of the Far East region but integrate trade with Mongolia , China , South Korea and Japan .\nAdditionally , the natural resources of the Far East and Siberia would attract foreign investment ( B.Otgonsuren , 2015 ) .\nHowever , some research suggests that the prospects for transit through Mongolia are relatively low and restricted mainly to the transportation of timber from Russia .\nThis is because Russian experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including coal , grain and containers either passes through the Trans-Siberian Railway to Chita and further to Harbin , or goes through Kazakhstan to Urumqi and farther to southern China ( Beijing ) .\nThey also note that for the successful operation of the already established routes through Mongolia , such measures as reduction of tariffs , advertising campaigns , ensuring lower risk indicators of the safety of cargo and smooth cross-border operations would facilitate trade between the countries .\n( V.Yu .\nMalov , 2018 ) Source : V.Yu .\nMalov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit as an Integral Part of the Belt and Road Initiative , \u201d Regional Research of Russia , 2019 .\nThere are further benefits and challenges regarding implementation of the BRI projects .\nApart from financial issues and railway gauge differences of the three countries and other related technical difficulties , there are socio-economic , political , and environmental risks associated with the BRI projects .\nWhile Mongolia is keen to develop its infrastructure and rail transportation , it lacks financial and technical resources .\nThis means that the financing of the projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese state .\nIn turn , this could place Mongolia at risk of excessive borrowing , thus increasing its dependency on China .\nIn fact , some research suggests that Mongolia is among the high-risk countries under debt distress through the BRI .\n( John Hurley et al , 2018 ) There are , however , opportunities .\nMongolia \u2019 s economy is heavily dependent on its mining sector and the recent Chinese ban on Australian coal opens the way for Mongolia to become China \u2019 s top coking coal supplier .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeastern parts of China ( Manchuria and Inner Mongolia ) are the key regions for the coking coal market .\nBRI projects such as railways and gas pipelines would smooth these processes and create economic opportunities .\nThis would allow China to meet its demand for coal and other natural gas from its two close neighbors at low cost .\nMongolia and Russia could become the main coal suppliers not just for China , but potentially to other Northeast Asian markets such as Japan .\nOn the other hand , the BRI transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the World Bank .\nDirect effects of the construction and operations of roads and rails include air and water pollution , soil erosion , habitat destruction and fragmentation , and timber depletion .\nIndirect effects are generated through road or railway operations .\nThe changes in transport availability and costs shift markets and human populations with far-reaching economic and environmental effects , such as habitat loss for numerous species , deforestation , wildlife and timber trafficking .\nA spatial assessment carried out by The World Wildlife Fund in 2017 found significant overlap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ecologically fragile places on earth .\n( WWF 2017 ) In the case of the BRI , areas within the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor are identified at \u2018 greatest risk \u2019 facing active deforestation .\nFor instance , regions within Heilongjiang in the Chinese territory , Republic of Buryatia , Irkutsk Oblast , Zabaykalsky Krai in the Russian territory and Lake Baikal close to Mongolian border are all identified as ecologically high-risk areas .\n( Elizabeth Losos et.al.\n, 2019 ) .\nMoreover , the proposed gas and oil pipeline project traversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten the livelihood of local communities in the areas .\nAs Julian Dierkes , Professor at the University of British Columbia \u2019 s Institute of Asian Research , observes , significant environmental risks would be born entirely by Mongolia .\nHe adds that the pipeline would result in a major disruption of herders \u2019 activities unless there is community involvement in the planning .\nHe also warns of the long-term risk of spills around a pipeline .\n( Communication to author , 2021 ) Indeed , the country \u2019 s economic relations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ability to protect the environment .\nThis can be seen from the nature of economic dependence and resource extraction at the national level .\nThis is especially true for mining and hydroelectric energy sectors .\nAs the mining sector is the engine of the Mongolian economy , addressing related environmental risks is a long-term challenge to sustainable development goals with local and global implications .\nFor example , in 2015 , Mongolia was planning to build a massive dam ( with partial Chinese investment ) on its largest river , Orkhon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and provide water for the country \u2019 s mining industry .\nThis has led environmental groups to raise concerns of dangers of the hydroelectric power plant and a related pipeline project to Lake Baikal which is just over the border in Russia .\n( Anson Mackay 2015 ) Similarly , other proposed hydropower plant projects on the largest Selenge river and its tributaries in northern Mongolia involve danger to the water system of Lake Baikal .\nWhile alternative approaches such as supplying Mongolia with electricity from various Russian hydroelectric and thermal power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be realized .\n( V.Yu.Malov 2019 ) On top of that , although the Government of Mongolia is committed to hydroelectric development as a potential solution to its electricity shortages and reduction of its energy dependency on its two neighbors , the hydroelectric energy sector has not been productive .\nThis is largely because the rivers remain frozen for most of the year and rivers are relatively small in size and capacity .\nThis has been further worsened by climate change impacts in recent years .\nWith regard to BRI projects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and norms of the host-country .\nTechnically , then , host countries are responsible to bear the risks associated .\nHowever , this is not just an issue of an individual country but also involves funding organizations and other related stakeholders .\nTherefore , for successful implementation of the CMREC projects under the BRI , a strategic environmental and social assessment is essential to ensure better outcomes .\nAs a signatory of international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals Agenda of the United Nations , BRI projects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international commitments and sustainable development efforts .\nAccording to a recent publication \u201c Greening the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor : A Visual Synthesis \u201d by Zoi Environment Network , while Mongolia generates 93 percent of its power from coal , it has the potential to become a regional clean energy ( wind and solar ) exporter from the country \u2019 s vast steppes and deserts .\nUnder the CMREC , a possible project is to create a regional integrated power supply and transmission network for exporting clean energy out of the Gobi Desert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian countries .\nConsidering that China and Russia aso have the highest energy potential from hydropower ( Statista , 2020 ) , there is an opportunity to switch to clean energy alternatives which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the region .\nHowever , so far , Chinese involvement in the Mongolia energy sector is still dependent on coal-related technologies as can be seen from the map below .\n( Zoi Environment Network , 2020 ) In this context , environmentally-friendly \u2018 green \u2019 technologies will be key to greening the economic corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while an \u2018 economic corridor \u2019 is considered a geographically-targeted development initiative that helps to develop infrastructure and increase people-to-people and economic connectivity , it is also a geopolitical tool .\n( Stephanie Petrella,2018 ) Against the backdrop of Beijing \u2019 s increasing attention to its neighboring countries there is growing significance given to regional economic integration and connectivity .\n( Peter Cai , 2017 ) Therefore , the article further analyzes geopolitical factors within the context of Mongolia \u2019 s \u2018 Third Neighbor \u2019 policy .\nGeographically , Mongolia is sandwiched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea .\nTherefore , the Corridor under the BRI is a golden opportunity for landlocked Mongolia to reach a wider international market and to diversify its economy .\nHowever , often-times , instead of seeing Mongolia as a potential contributor to global market chains , international specialists see it as a potential \u2018 geopolitical chessboard \u2019 amid rising geopolitical tensions .\nThis is because historically , Mongolia \u2019 s relations were restricted within the sphere of its two neighbors .\nMongolia was viewed as \u2018 a pawn whose fate was determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Alicia Campi , 2020 ) For example , Mongolia maintained good relations with both countries until the Sino-Soviet schism of the 1950s .\nWith the intensified Sino-Soviet clash in the mid-1960s , the Mongolian People \u2019 s Republic became a front-line of Soviet defense against China for the next two decades .\n( Jeff Goodson , Jonathan Addleton 2020 ) However , with the collapse of the Soviet Union , Mongolia entered into a new era .\nRelations between China and Mongolia improved with the exchange of high-level state visits of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Declaration on Friendship and Good-Neighborly Cooperation \u2019 between Mongolia and Russia .\n( Ts.Batbayar , 1998 ) In 1990 , Mongolia took important steps toward becoming a multiparty , pluralistic and democratic society .\nWith the New Constitution of 1992 , Mongolia declared its intention of pursuing balanced relations with its two neighbors and a new framework for a continued open foreign policy and a new international orientation .\nWhile Mongolia enjoys friendly relations with its two neighbors , it also follows a \u2018 Third Neighbor \u2019 foreign policy .\nGiven changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongolia \u2019 s relations with other countries including the United States , Japan , Germany and South Korea are expanding .\nParticularly , the vast mineral resources in Mongolia have not only attracted foreign investments but also have allowed it to expand its relations with those countries .\nAmong its \u2018 third neighbors \u2019 , the role of the United States is an important factor in its relations with its two neighbors .\nArguably , growing geopolitical and geoeconomic competition between China and the United States will affect Mongolia significantly as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Road Initiative and in the U.S \u2018 Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\n\u2019 ( Mendee Jargalsaikhan , 2020 ) For example , experts highlight the direct impact of the so-called U.S-China trade war on Mongolia .\nAs China is Mongolia \u2019 s dominant economic partner , this leaves it highly vulnerable to Chinese economic fluctuations and Chinese pressures .\n( Jeff Goodson , Jonathan Addleton 2020 ) Given that , it can be said that Mongolia \u2019 s fate will be substantially affected by geopolitical rivalries among the big powers .\nThis includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mineral and energy sources .\nFor Ulaanbaatar , this would mean that it has to ensure that the development of its mining industry does not result in dependency on either of its neighbors .\nAs a result , external investments from third countries are significant .\nOn one hand , as a young democratic country , Mongolia looks up to its \u2018 third neighbors \u2019 like the United States , Japan , and others ; on the other hand , its economic fate is closely connected with Russia and China .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might win in the great power competition , but how Mongolia can navigate through all these factors while keeping the right balance in the sphere of geopolitics in flux .\nThis is not to suggest that these geopolitical factors will be a major challenge for the implementation of BRI projects .\nIn fact , as some Mongolian scholars point out , rather than seeing geopolitical factors as a hindrance to Mongolia \u2019 s infrastructure development , it is important to see it as an economic and political opportunity .\n( Uradyn E.Bulag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by international experts who argue that while the majority of analysts see Chinese motives under the BRI as combing economic and strategic drivers , focusing on the geopolitical dimensions of the BRI undermines its principally geo-economic drivers .\n( Peter Cai , 2017 ) In this context , it can be said that Mongolia can benefit from the BRI provided all the parties can exert strong political will and commitment to the projects under the Corridor .\nAs far as China and Russia is concerned , the rapprochement of the two countries following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persist for the time being as both Russia and China face sanctions from the West , above all from the United States .\nThis could push the two countries to strengthen their economic cooperation within the framework of the BRI .\nWhile Western analysts are sceptical about the continuation of the Sino-Russian alliance , some experts highlight that even in the case of lifted or relaxed sanctions of western countries , Russia is likely to tilt toward China for its economic growth .\n( Alexander Gabuev , 2016 ) While it is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between China , Mongolia and Russia would be successful or not in the long term , it can become clear that potential outcomes from the BRI projects have far-reaching regional and global implications .\nOverall , BRI projects hold both opportunities and challenges for Mongolia .\nHowever , if addressed correctly , it seems that the challenges can be translated into future opportunities .\nIn other words , to fully benefit from the Corridor and to avoid potential risks involved , care should be taken to safeguard the environmental and social criteria in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would in turn , contribute to realization of Sustainable

Connection", "content": "The change of guard in the American White House has proved that nothing has changed from the Trump regime with respect to US foreign policy .\nPresident Biden and his party continue the American propaganda attacks on Russia , China , Iran , North Korea , Venezuela , Cuba and other nations that try to march to their own tune , and will continue preparations for aggressive actions focused on Russia , Iran and China , in other words for war against those nations .\nAlready , in just the first week of Biden \u2019 s presidency we have witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navalny gambit being used as a device to undermine Russia .\nThe Navalny scenario can not succeed but the Americans will not stop at that .\nDuring that same week , Biden diverted the aircraft carrier , USS Roosevelt , a ship named after a president who a number of historians believe did not die a natural death , from its recent mission of threatening Iran in the Persian Gulf , to a new mission of threatening China in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straight , and China \u2019 s important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that region .\nWhile the Democratic Party accused Trump of being a Russian agent , his supporters claim Biden is a Chinese agent .\nAmericans take these absurd claims seriously because they need to believe in foreign scapegoats who they can punish for the failures of their own government and an economic , social and political system that is incapable of solving the many problems facing that declining power and its people .\nBut the propaganda has become so constant and intense that it takes on a life of its own and becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been successful in creating hostility and bigotry towards China and Russia that the hegemon uses as a pretext to increase its preparations for war against both countries if they do not bend down and kiss America \u2019 s feet .\nThe American-NATO encirclement of Eurasia progresses with NATO building up its offensive capabilities in the west from the Baltic down to the Mediterranean , through the Black Sea , the Middle East , Afghanistan , to the east with its huge build up of forces in the Pacific , its constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , in western China and its support of the renegade regime in the province of Taiwan .\nThis has reached such a level that China , frustrated with refusal of the Americans to answer continuous calls for dialogue is prepared for war over Taiwan if that is what it takes to defend China \u2019 s sovereignty .\nBut these direct military threats are not the only means they are using to attack and undermine Russia and China .\nThey use regional alliances , economic blockades , labelled as \u201c sanctions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid warfare to try to weaken them .\nThe situation in Thailand is a prime example of this strategy .\nOne of the few nations of southeast Asia to escape European imperialism and colonialism , it maintains its independence while trying to balance between competing powers in the region .\nAfter the Second World War it cooperated with the United States in its war against Vietnam and fought against communists in its own country , allowed the US to use some of its military bases for their operations and engaged in annual joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of that time the Americans were not too concerned with \u201c human rights \u201d or \u201c democracy \u201d in Thailand .\nBut since the rise of China from the devastation caused by the west \u2019 s colonialism , the invasion and occupation by the Japanese and has succeeded in establishing socialism , a better life for its people and become a world economic power , Thailand has come to regard China as a more reliable and sympathetic regional partner than the United States both in terms of economic issues and with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of the United States in the region and the rise of China \u2019 s influence , particularly since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative , has led logically to Thailand seeking closer relations with China , something which the United States can not tolerate .\nThe United States has tried to restore its influence in the region but aside from Japan , and South Korea , still occupied by US forces , and Australia , which enthusiastically supports the US aggression , it has not succeeded in luring other Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut it has not stopped trying , and if it can not persuade or force a government to adhere to its will , it goes to the next step of attempting to overthrow the existing government and replacing it with one more willing to be its vassal .\nThe Arab Spring , so-called was an example of this strategy .\nLibya was the result .\nThe Americans have tried this with Vietnam , and The Philippines , among other nations , and is trying with Thailand .\nTo do this it sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of \u201c human rights \u201d and demands the \u201c democratisation of Thailand \u201d and an overthrow of its constitutional monarchy .\nThat these calls are sheer hypocrisy the world knows all too well .\nThe United States has never supported any democratic government , whether socialist or capitalist , that does not serve its interests and has supported dictatorships the world over .\nWhere is democracy in Afghanistan occupied by the US , and its allies , for 20 years ?\nWhere in Iraq , in Rwanda , in Libya , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has invaded or whose government it has overthrown ?\nWhere is the democracy in the United States where only two political parties are allowed to share power , each almost a mirror image of the other , and representing not the people but two factions of capital , one of which , represented by Trump , a nationalist faction , and the other , now represented by Biden , a \u201c globalist \u201d faction , which seeks to break the world into small pieces they can easily to dominate for their profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , in Belarus , in Myanmar , in other places around the world from Africa to Latin America , the United States is increasing its attempts to undermine the Thai government in order to replace it with one that will serve its interests and which will be opposed to China \u2019 s influence in the region and its Belt and Road Imitative .\nOne of the Americans \u2019 key strategies to accomplish this objective is by backing what they calls \u201c democratic groups , \u201d or \u201c the civil society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn December 3 , 2020 nine US Senators submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Congress a Resolution aimed at Thailand which among things , In other words the United States is directly interfering in the internal affairs of Thailand , something that it will not tolerate from other nations with respect to itself as we saw in the recent US elections and the false American claims of Russian and Chinese influence in the elections .\nThe United States also tries to manipulate the Thai people , especially the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the battalion of agencies it has created to support and encourage them .\nIt flows funds and expertise and personnel through a number of its agencies set up to interfere in other nations under the guise of \u201c supporting democracy \u201d including the National Endowment For Democracy , USAID , the CIA The Peace Corps and related agencies .\nIt also uses military-technical cooperation aimed at gaining influence over young officers in the armed forces , and scholarships to American universities for students they have identified as useful to them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been exerted through outside agents , for example some of the British and US financed and controlled \u201c protestors \u201d from Hong Kong travelled to Bangkok land Thai \u201c democracy \u201d activists visited Hong Kong last year to stir up trouble and advised local groups on tactics , even styles of dress and colour codes .\nTo get some idea of the extent of American interference in Thai domestic politics we need only look at a US State Department Fact Sheet for Thailand , which brags about , \u201c the US Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 , \u201d The Peace Corps has long been known as a conduit for the CIA to infiltrate nations and gain influence over people .\nThey go on to state , This is not done out of the goodness of their heart but to identify and control youth who regard as potentially useful to them as collaborators willing to advance US interests over Thai national interests .\nThey add , The American organisation USAID ( Agency For International Development is very active in Thailand .\nTheir fact sheet states that , It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made when they have not succeeded in establishing a just and fair society in the United States , but America is famous or notorious for its hypocrisy .\nAnd , of course , the \u201c challenges \u201d in their view are the Thai government itself , whose constitutional monarchy established in 1932 is not good enough for the Americans to tolerate thought it tolerates them and absolute monarchies among many of its allies , from many NATO countries to the Gulf States .\nOne of the main tools used to interfere in nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endowment For Democracy , whose function used to be under the aegis of the CIA .\nIt states on its website that in 2017 ( the latest year available on their site but we can assume nothing has changed since then ) that , It then lists a number of groups and organisations in Thailand to which it has given funds , all having the objective of bringing \u201c democratic values \u201d to Thailand , meaning in reality funding groups used to manipulate the people into overthrowing the present government to replace it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one willing to supports US interests instead of its own , willing to surrender Thai sovereignty .\nThe list includes a number with the words \u201c human rights \u201d included in their name .\nOther examples are the Union For Civil Liberty , Caf\u00e9 Democracy , The Thai Volunteer Service , The Solidarity Centre , the EnlawThai Foundation , online media platforms such as 101 Perecent Company Ltd. and The Isaan Record , US influence is also exerted by the Soros Open Society Foundation , whose name reflects not a respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national economies to the free flow of western capital to make profit .\nGeorge Soros has a bad reputation in Thailand as it believed by many that he helped crash the Thai currency in 1997 , harming the Thai people , but profiting him .\nSoros also funds the Thai journal Prachatai and various ngos as well as the US organisation , Human Rights Watch , to which he gave 100 million dollars in 2010 and which on January 13 , 2021 issued a statement condemning the Thai government for repression of protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests .\nOne can imagine what the US government would do if Russia or China or Thailand called for protestors for democracy in the US to increase their activities there .\nBut of course , the Americans are an exceptional people , above all laws and morality , always asserting their right to judge others while denying the right of others to judge them .\nIn their important 1999 paper on military theory , \u201c Unrestricted Warfare , \u201d two Chinese Army Colonels , Qiao Liang and Wang Xiansiu , now both generals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules , with nothing forbidden .\nThey then examined the use of full spectrum warfare and why it is the only strategy to adopt in order to resist a powerful aggressor who does not obey international rules but makes up its own , such as the United States which , as they point out , can not even be trusted to obey its own rules .\nHow can anyone trust a nation that seems to have the same motto as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said , \u201c Law ?\nI make up my own laws and I take what I want.\n\u201d The United States has adopted this type of warfare for its own purposes and the undermining of a nation from within is one of their most dangerous types of this kind of warfare .\nThailand , like Russia , China , and other nations , must ever be alert to the dangers represented by the many tentacles of American influence that have spread across the world and threaten world peace and security .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adhere to the fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations ; the sovereignty of nations , the right to self-determination of and non-interference in nations , and the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations .\nThe Americans want us to forget about those principles .\nBut we can not .\nWe will not.\n\u201d Note to readers : please click the share buttons

girl Greta \u2019 s support to farmers movement .\nSachin Tendulkar and other pro-BJP forces also joined the chorus .\nMost of these forces are pro-monopoly houses and hardly have any engagement with the agrarian production .\nOne \u2019 s own social location in terms of caste plays a key role in taking stands when the farmers of India and the business and industrial houses are on the course of conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on convenience .\nIn a globalised world international opinions get expressed on many things .\nIn fact the BJP/RSS mobilized international opinions in their favour on many occasions .\nSuch international opinions were expressed during the anti-rape Nirbhaya agitation and the RSS/BJP combine was very happy and welcomed such global opinions coming in since those opinions were against the Congress Government at that time .\nThe farmers issue is a massive survival issue of the whole nation itself .\nI have never in my life time experienced such massive agitation by farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of people know about agriculture ?\nParticularly Kangana Ranaut \u2019 s language against farmers has shocked the whole world , not just the nation .\nIt is a well known fact that Kangana is a Ksatriya arrow left on the Indian Shudra farmers by Yogi Adithyanath .\nI say this with conviction because the agitating farmers mostly are Shudras and the Ksatriyas as a community did not put its hand on the plough , in their historical existence , though they own estates of land .\nThey treat tilling land below their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Uttar Pradesh are in the lead of the movement at present under the leadership of Rakesh Tikait , who is a son of the famous Mahendra Singh Tikait .\nEven then Kangana says the same thing that she was saying against Punjab farmers linking this agitation to Khalistan .\nThe caste system makes many of the policy decisions biased .\nThere is a clear divide between the agrarian production and the business networks that want to make business and make profits around agrarian produce .\nFarmers have never evolved into a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end agriculturist communities like Kamma , Reddy , Velama , Kapu , Lingayat , Jat , Gujjar , Yadav , Maratha and so on did not get into high end monopoly businesses .\nThe high end business is mainly in the hands of national Banias , Brahmins , Kayathas , Khatris .\nOf late Ksatriyas are also entering into business .\nThe farmers \u2019 fears get compounded because of this caste divide also .\nKanagana , who characterises the food producers comes from a family that never tilled an acre of land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of grain .\nShe comes from a horse riding and knife wielding family heritage .\nPerhaps she has not seen how a farmer \u2019 s furrow germinates the plant that becomes the source of life blood of all others in the country while living in a mansion in Himachal Pradesh .\nThere is a fine Telugu folk song that has become a trend setter on youtube written by a Telugu writer Asta Gangadhar \u2018 Raithu ( farmer ) the Legend \u2019 and sung by Relare Ganga , which broadly goes as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real hero of the nation and real legend of the nation , a terrorist repeatedly .\nShe does not seem to read or hear what is said and written about her daily attack on farmers .\nWhy did the international response come even after so many days of farmer agitation against the new farm laws ?\nA tribal environmentalist young girl from North East India called Kangujam , who is just nine , gave a call to the world to respond to the suffering farmers in the cold , in corona pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are facing police lathis , barricades along with insufficient food and water .\nKangujam tweeted , \u201c Dear friends , our millions of poor farmers sleeping in the streets in this cold weather don \u2019 t expect anything from you .\nJust your one tweet of love and support /solidarity to their cause means a lot to them .\nOur Indian celebrities are lost !\n\u201d This appeal of our own environmentalist young Adivasi girl invoked responses from many global celebrities including Rihanna who said in her hashtag tweet \u201c Why aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 protest \u201d with a picture of Indian farmers living in the cold on the Delhi border .\nThis led to a series of tweets .\nGreta Thunberg said \u201c We stand in solidarity with the farmers protest in India \u201d Actress and Instagram influencer Amanda Cerny too showed her support : Kanagana said in her tweet in response to these international tweets , they \u201c are not farmers but terrorists who are trying to divide India \u201d .\nShe not only repeatedly slut shamed Rihanna in a aseries of tweets , Ranaut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoilt brat \u201d .\nKangana \u2019 s response must be seen in the background of the BJP Government trying to project the farmers movement as Khalistani terrorist movement .\nFor the first time in six years Modi rule a political blunder has been committed .\nHe went after farmers who voted the BJP to power twice .\nHis Government and party also do not stop such a miscalculated attack on the farmers .\nWhy should the Government of India become very sensitive to individual criticism from abroad ?\nAs I said such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape agitation took place in Delhi .\nThe narrative of farmers getting attacked as terrorists is certainly making the organic intellectuals coming from the agrarian family background who write in every regional language their own songs , stories and novels .\nThe farmers agitation has inspired a new genre of writing

for the Far East was declared reopened for the purpose of taking up a category of crimes against humanity unaddressed in 1946\u2014crimes against women in the form , specifically , of military sexual slavery .\nHere , we are speaking of the Japanese military .\nIts victims , known as \u201c comfort women \u201d ( \u6170\u5b89\u5a66 ) in an especially egregious exercise of euphemism , hailed from all over Japan \u2019 s empire , including the homeland , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s International War Crimes Tribunal ( \u5973\u6027\u56fd\u969b\u6226\u72af\u6cd5\u5ef7 ) was the culmination of arduous and imaginative work by activists , legal specialists , and scholars from the region and beyond .\nThere were men\u2014many of them\u2014who collaborated in every aspect of this process .\nDuring the Tribunal itself , they were present as expert witnesses , as prosecutors , and as authors of amicus curiae briefs arguing for due process on behalf of the deceased defendants as well as the Government of Japan , which declined to send representatives .\n( See richly documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants , video clips , and texts . )\nThe Tribunal represented the committed labor of international civil society , in response to a phenomenon that had been tacitly known for decades , but which , especially in the 1990s , could no longer be ignored , as survivors themselves came forward , but state actors , notably Japan , refused to respond .\nIt is the testimony of these courageous women , many no longer with us , that formed the centerpiece of the proceedings .\nAnd that testimony has left us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical and legal , that must be taken into account in subsequent attempts to address the \u201c comfort woman \u201d issue .\nThe Tribunal took place over three days , from December 8-10 , 2000 .\nThe fourth day , while the four-person panel ( three women , from the U.S. , the U.K. , and Argentina , and one man , from Kenya ) of distinguished jurists serving as judges deliberated , we were able to hear from women subjected to crimes in ongoing military conflicts .\nOn December 12 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe full judgment in the case of The Prosecutors and the Peoples of the Asia-Pacific Region v. Hirohito Emperor Showa , Ando Rikichi [ and 8 other military leaders ] and the Government of Japan , amounting to 312 pages in the pdf version , was delivered December 4 , 2001 at The Hague .\nI had the great good fortune to attend all the proceedings in Tokyo .\nThe venue , Kudan Kaikan , crackled with excitement , with media from all over the world ( though tellingly , only one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with information and goods from struggles the world over .\nPausing over the literature and handicrafts at the Zapatista table , I suddenly felt closer to Chiapas than I ever had at home in Chicago\u2014and not just because I could buy a souvenir with the masked image of Subcommandante Marcos .\nJudges , prosecutors , witnesses , and survivors were all housed in Kudan Kaikan , which not only had a long association with the emperor and the prewar military but was located not far from Yasukuni Shrine .\nIt was there where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 wars since the Meiji Era were enshrined ; and there where cabinet members of the Liberal Democratic Party betook themselves for performative visits , rousing affirmation and bitter controversy , depending on one \u2019 s view of Japan \u2019 s role in World War II .\nDuring a lunch break , one of the veritable army of volunteers walked about , carrying a sign attached to a pole warning us to be careful of what we said \u201c because there are many right-wingers around.\n\u201d Inside the large hall , over 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnity and drama that would be sustained for the duration of the proceedings .\nWhat our sight could grasp was augmented by earphones providing multilingual translations .\nLooking back , I reexperience the pride I felt in watching two distinguished African American women jurists : Patricia Viseur Sellers , serving as co-chief prosecutor , and Gabrielle Kirk McDonald , chief justice .\nThat the Tribunal happened at all felt miraculous then and even more so , now .\nThe large miracle contained multiple discreet miracles , such as the North and South Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indictment .\nWe were even granted perpetrator testimony , in the form of two veterans who shared in some detail their experiences of rape and gang rape in China\u2014acts that the \u201c comfort woman system \u201d was meant to prevent .\nSurely , they had children and grandchildren ?\nAnd yet they had brought themselves there , to testify .\nAs they bowed to make their exit , the survivors applauded them .\nWe knew we were watching a living history , one that inadvertently and yet necessarily presented us with an invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupation .\nIt began with the courageously pioneering Dutch survivor testifying that Batavia [ Indonesia ] was \u201c paradise \u201d until the Japanese came .\nLater , the video shows her sitting close by , with intent interest , as we hear testimony from Indonesian survivors .\nAnd then , it is East Timor \u2019 s turn .\nThe prosecutor for Indonesia expresses her regret to the court that she had not been able to prepare fully because of Indonesia \u2019 s military occupation of East Timor .\nThe prosecutor for Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will applaud the Timorese survivors as they depart after their spirited testimony .\nIn fact , it was in the course of pursuing Indonesian violence against women that the survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery were discovered .\nEsmeralda Boe and Marta Abu Bere left an indelible impression with their surprised response to the ritual question of whether they promised to tell the truth : why would they not ?\nThey had not come to Japan for sightseeing .\nThe final day took place in a different , still larger venue .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirk McDonald \u2019 s calm , warm tones , the pronouncement of Hirohito \u2019 s guilt .\nWho among us will forget that moment ?\nMany of these scenes can be found in the invaluable documentary , Breaking the History of Silence .\nThe Tribunal it records was a historical event whose significance is both reinforced and newly revealed with the passage of time .\nThe intensified denial and hatemongering by nationalist groups and the backtracking of the Government of Japan ( read the pathbreaking \u201c Statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but increasingly difficult to find ) are dispiriting and worse , but they can not negate the event and its record .\nOr the power generated by the collective effort to give respectful hearing to those who had been denied the right to report the destruction of their lives and the theft of their dignity .\nWatch the documentary and explore the records archived , all accessible at the site of the Women \u2019 s Active Museum on War and Peace .\nThere you will see the scrupulous efforts made to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present concrete suggestions for a path ahead .\nSome of this is concisely presented in the follow-up video , Hague Final Judgment , which , incidentally , captures a moment when Japanese members of a small party attempting to deliver a copy of the Judgment to the Japanese Embassy are told by officials\u2014yes , Japanese\u2014that they must be addressed in English .\nInevitably , to watch the documentaries today is to register loss , beginning with many of the survivors , including the Timorese .\nThey were already frail twenty years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also gone is Matsui Yayori , co-convenor and the spirit behind the entire undertaking .\nStill young attorney Kazuko Kawaguchi , one of the Japanese prosecutors .\nThe two Japanese veterans .\nAnd with a start , followed by piercing grief , we identify the face of prosecutor Park Won-soon , social justice activist , campaigner for the rights of \u201c comfort women , \u201d and longest-serving mayor of Seoul until he took his own life in July 2020 , apparently in response to allegations of sexual harassment .\nPlease read the succinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was deeply involved in the Tribunal and is now Director of the Women \u2019 s Active Museum .\nAnd then turn to the videos .\nRevisiting the Women \u2019 s International War Crimes Tribunal : Saying \u201c No !\n\u201d to Impunity.1 The year 2020 marked the 20-year anniversary of the Women \u2019 s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan \u2019 s Military Sexual Slavery ( hereafter the Women \u2019 s Tribunal ) held in Tokyo in December 2000 .\nFor this occasion , the Women \u2019 s Active Museum on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized a special exhibition focusing on the Women \u2019 s Tribunal , entitled \u201c The War Responsibility of the Emperor \u2013 Voices Against Oblivion.\n\u201d It is intended as a challenge to the citizens of Japan , who concealed and then consented to forget the emperor \u2019 s responsibility , as head of state and chief commander , for the conduct of the Japanese military in World War II.2 The establishment of WAM embodies the last wishes of Matsui Yayori , a prominent journalist and women \u2019 s rights activist who proposed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Tribunal .\nShe held this to be a responsibility that women in Japan needed to shoulder .\nTragically , she died of cancer only two years after the Women \u2019 s Tribunal .\nThree years later , in August 2005 , WAM was installed in a small corner of a building in Tokyo , thanks to donations mainly from people in Japan .\nSince then , WAM has held exhibitions , archived testimonies and documentary evidence , engaged in fact-finding projects and participated in actions in solidarity with the victims/survivors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the \u201c comfort woman \u201d system .\nPunish the guilty !\nFor the sake of peace by Kang Duk-kyung , 1995 ( Courtesy of the House of Sharing ) Prior to and during preparations for the 20th anniversary exhibition , we assembled and researched the archives .\nIt was on February 6 of 1994 that an epochal event took place : six Korean women , who had been subjected to sexual enslavement as \u201c comfort women \u201d to the Japanese military , arrived in Japan , statement of complaint in hand .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to receive their statement .\nFootage from that day reveals frustration and anger pouring from the words and evident in the faces of Kang Duk-kyung , who painted \u201c Punish the Guilty !\nFor the sake of peace , \u201d as well as Kim Soon-duk , Yi Young-suk , Mun P \u2019 il-gi , Pak Tu-ri , and Pak Ok-ry\u014f .\nThe force of their emotion is overwhelming .\nThis action , which sought the punishment of responsible parties , met with a chilly reception from Japanese society as a whole .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinged with negativity , such as \u201c our kids might be bullied \u201d or \u201c some people \u2019 s parents could be targeted.\n\u201d But there were others who said , \u201c I wanted to quit being Japanese , but now I know what I need to do , \u201d and expressed their resolve at the report-back assembly after the action .\nThe halmoni had hurled their cries at the heart of postwar Japanese pacifism , which had failed , even in its dreams , to imagine the possibility of punishing those responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhat Kang Duk-kyung and the others sought was not punishment of the foot soldiers who had directly caused them to suffer , but of those who were in positions of responsibility .\nWho was it that came up with the system of Japanese military sexual slavery and ordered its implementation ?\nWhose face should we see behind the maintenance of this inhumane system ?\nThey wanted the truth to be revealed .\nMun P \u2019 il-gi , who , during her 1994 visit , had shouted out the demand that those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the two former Japanese soldiers , Kaneko Yasuji and Suzuki Yoshio , witnesses at the Women \u2019 s Tribunal .\nShe had come to care about their well-being .\nThese halmoni had witnessed the anguish caused by the memory , seared into soldiers \u2019 hands , of the killings they had been ordered to commit .\nWe can readily imagine that the ones the halmoni could not bring themselves to forgive were those with power , the ones who had never had to sully their own hands , who never experienced pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort and died surrounded by their families .\nJapanese society remains predisposed not to pursue the responsibility of those in charge .\nPublic documents are destroyed or falsified so that \u201c higher ups \u201d are not held accountable , even as those actually compelled to commit criminal acts are robbed of their lives\u2014all the more so if they are sincere .\nSurely , many have had these thoughts as they watched the allegations of deception and falsification of official documents unfold in the case of the Moritomo and Kake educational institutions .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s International War Crimes Tribunal , WAM has launched a web-based archival project dedicated to the Tribunal .\nWe will be conducting interviews and adding documents , updating the contents throughout 2021 , hoping that people in Japan as well as the global community will revisit this people \u2019 s initiative for justice for the survivors of military sexual slavery .\nCourtesy of Video Juku , \u201c Breaking the History of Silence , \u201d the documentary video of the Tribunal , will be available for free until December 4 , 2021 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The Hague 20 years ago .\nWe hope that

\u2019 s nickel industry as other major investors flock to a country with the range of mineral elements needed to turn it into one of the world \u2019 s leading producers of lithium batteries and electric cars .\nIt is not the first time he has defended China \u2019 s growing role in the Indonesian economy .\n\u201c Like it or not , happy or not happy , whatever is said , China is a world power that can \u2019 t be ignored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t dodge facts out in the field.\n\u201d While European interest often remains focused on just one level of the manufacturing process , the hard-charging Chinese are developing a fully-integrated supply chain , from stainless steel and lithium batteries to even copper wire and other finished products .\nAs Panjaitan puts it : \u201c All the way down.\n\u201d However narrowly focused it may be for now , it is a vindication of the once much-criticized value-added mining policy introduced during the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Joko Widodo administration .\nWhen he steps down in 2024 , President Widodo will almost certainly leave a legacy as Indonesia \u2019 s \u201c Infrastructure President.\n\u201d But his uncertain handling of the Covid-19 notwithstanding , it could be so much more if his government can lay the groundwork for a great leap forward in industrial development .\nAs an illustration , he recalled a Chinese engineer telling him during his tour of the plant : He might have added South Korea , with lithium battery-maker LG Chemical and car manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.3 billion that will give them a leading role in the fledgling electric car industry .\nPanjaitan and his team have also had four rounds of talks with American auto giant Tesla , a major producer of lithium battery packs whose interest in Indonesia lies in several diverse areas , including the location of a future SpaceX rocket launch pad on the northern Papuan island of Biak .\nIndustry aside , Panjaitan has also been a leading figure behind Indonesia \u2019 s planned sovereign wealth fund , which has attracted initial pledges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IDFC ) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ( ADIA ) , the body that manages the emirate \u2019 s excess oil reserves .\nGovernment planners say the introduction of electric vehicles on the domestic market and a concerted push into solar power , neglected up to now , will help reduce Indonesia \u2019 s $ 21.2 billion in energy imports by at least a third and also utilize 8,000 megawatts of oversupply on the Java-Bali electricity grid .\nPanjaitan and other senior officials are confident incentives in the newly-passed Job Creation Omnibus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge with President Widodo ready to sign the last of the EV implementing regulations , some aimed at protecting smaller local producers .\nThe general-turned-businessman falls back on military terminology in explaining what he calls his \u201c rules of engagement \u201d for potential investors \u2013 first-class technology , added-value , majority Indonesian labor , technology transfer and business-to-business deals only .\nSkilled labor is still an issue .\nFinding employees for technical positions has struck an obstacle in Morawali , for example , after it was found the education level of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for them to enter a newly-established polytechnic .\nProgress on the electric car has already been impressive , despite the worrying economic impact of the pandemic which has infected more than one million Indonesians and left 30,000 dead .\nIn the space of a few months , LG Chemical confirmed the planned construction of a $ 9.8 billion lithium battery venture in Batang , Central Java and Hyundai announced it is moving its Malaysia-based regional hub and an entire China assembly line to Indonesia .\nAt the same time , Panjaitan expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month on Tsingshan Steel \u2019 s offer to build Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold \u2019 s long-delayed copper smelter at its Weda Bay nickel processing facility on Halmahera , the main island of the Maluku chain .\nIt now appears Tsingshan has been the driving force all along behind the sudden decision to move the long-delayed project from Gresik , near the East Java port city of Surabaya , to Halmahera , 3,400 kilometers to the northeast and closer to Freeport \u2019 s Grasberg mine operation in Papua .\nThat \u2019 s because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelting process is needed to produce nickel sulfide , the composition of the alloy used in cathodes .\nThe existing Gresik smelter , operated by Mitsubishi , supplies the by-product to a state-owned fertilizer company .\nPanjaitan says Tsingshan has agreed to pay 85 % of the cost of the $ 1.8 billion facility , with Freeport and the government , the majority partner in its Indonesian subsidiary , committed to sharing the balance .\nBut sources familiar with the talks say the Chinese are still holding out for a smaller 75 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what Freeport will have to fork out for treatment and refinement charges ( TCs/RCs ) and how that will relate to the 5 % export tax the Phoenix-based mining giant now pays for the half of the concentrate output it currently exports to mainly Japan and Spain .\nTsingshan is also in talks with Indonesian firm PT Merdeka Copper and Gold to supply pyrite rock from a mine on Wetar island , south of Weda Bay , to the $ 7.8 billion Morawali nickel-processing complex , which began construction in 2013 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be producing lithium batteries by 2023 when high-speed acid-leach operations come online .\nA fourth $ 5.3 billion battery plant to be built by China \u2019 s Contemporary Amperez Technology ( CATL ) is planned for

500,000-ton carbon steel facility and a 600,000-ton high-carbon ferrochrome plant .\nFurther down the coast , in Southeast Sulawesi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has completed the $ 1.4 billion first stage of its three-phase Konawe complex , which will eventually boast production of three million tons of ferronickel a year .\nIt is still unclear how much of Tsingshan \u2019 s nickel sulfide will be allocated to other battery makers .\nThe only element Indonesia does not have in abundance is the lithium used to produce anodes , which will likely be imported from either Australia or China .\nIllustrating the synergy which is already developing in the electric car business , Tsingshan \u2019 s Weda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already has a joint venture with LG Chemical in the production of precursors and cathodes in Wuxi , north of Shanghai .\nPanjaitan says LG was initially reluctant to expand into Indonesia but finally came around after he convinced the company of the logic behind investing in a country with

work\u2026 is no longer a matter of choice for Japan .\nIt is instead a matter of the greatest urgency.\n\u201d \u2014 PM Abe Shinz\u014d , speaking to the United Nations in September 2013 .\n( Emphasis added . )\n\u201c Since Japan \u2019 s population is shrinking , capital is finite , and productivity gains will take time , unless radical steps are taken quickly , we argued [ in 1999 ] that the nation not only faced the risk of a further decline in its productivity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower standards of living as well.\n\u201d \u2013Kathy Matsui , Vice-Chair and Chief Strategist of Goldman Sachs Japan .\n( Emphasis added . )\nIn 1999 a group of investment strategists at Goldman Sachs Japan led by Kathy Matsui applied the term \u2018 Womenomics \u2019 to describe their recommended strategy for revitalizing the stagnant Japanese economy by \u201c closing the gender employment gap \u201d and promoting the better utilization of human capital through workplace equality.1 Two decades later , and six years after seeing Womenomics adopted as official government policy , Matsui claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changers in Japan \u2019 s attitude towards gender issues was the shift from diversity being a social or human rights issue to being an economic and business imperative.\n\u201d 2 This article critically examines whether the elevation of gender within economic discourse has been matched by results in the economy and in society .\nIt finds that notwithstanding several important innovations in the past three years relating to labour standards , pay equity , tax policy , and the funding of both paternity leave and daycare , Japan seems fated to fall drastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gender equity in the 2020s .\n\u201c Abenomics \u201d , a brochure and website by the Government of Japan updated in June 2020 , touted the Abe government \u2019 s achievements since taking office in 2012 in promoting the status of women in the Japanese economy.3 It pointed out that , between 2012 and 2019 , the number of women in private sector management positions \u201c approached 10 % \u201d , while 3.3 million joined the workforce .\nAn impressive graph showed Japan \u2019 s labour force participation rate for females vaulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period , to 74.0 % compared with just 70.9 % for the US .\nUnfortunately , these statistics were misleading insofar as they failed to mention the precarity of the female workforce .\nIn 2017 , 50 % of the 28 million women in the Japanese labour market were in \u2018 non-regular \u2019 jobs with few benefits , lower pay and shorter hours than \u2018 regular \u2019 ( i.e .\n\u2018 permanent \u2019 ) employees , in comparison to just 16.7 % of the 35 million male workers.4 By 2019 , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females and 22.8 % of males respectively.5 Unsurprisingly , women disproportionately bore the brunt of unemployment in the COVID-19 recession .\nOf the record 970,000 people who had just been laid off in April 2020 , 710,000 were women , making them the \u201c shock absorbers \u201d of the Japanese economy .\nThe current situation of Japan \u2019 s female workers is deeply rooted in 75 years of history .\nPostwar Japan pioneered novel institutions that combined both foreign and domestic elements in the realms of education , the financial system , bureaucracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena , this meant that the export of manufactured products , capital and people was stressed , while their import was not .\nThis strategy was facilitated and reinforced by a high domestic savings rate and high export earnings .\nAn employment structure was also developed based on lifetime employment and seniority wages for elite workers in large corporations , enterprise unions which agreed to non-confrontational labour relations and long hours in exchange for job security , and paternalistic company welfare functions in elite corporations .\nThese institutions of high-speed growth worked well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to being the world \u2019 s second largest economy , consistent with an advanced welfare state and lower levels of income inequality than almost every other developed country.6 Underpinning this entire system , however , was a sexual division of labour in which women accepted virtually sole responsibility for household management , the raising of children , and the care of aging parents .\nWomen \u2019 s management of household finances gave them an important role in helping to generate the savings that financed the economic miracle , but no say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pervaded Japanese society despite only directly benefitting a small number of elite male middle-class workers.7 As millions of women gained ground in affluence , education , and juridical status , many began to see the role of housewife and mother as a trap .\nR. Taggart Murphy describes this perceived trap as being more pronounced , and more problematic , in Japan than in other industrial and industrializing countries , where men are both more able and more willing to share in housework and child-rearing .\n\u201c For while Japanese blue-collar workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners , shadowy Far Right fixers , ambitious politicians and the University of Tokyo-bred mandarin class\u2026had all had their input during the 1950s when the institutions of high-speed growth assumed their final shape , women were not represented .\nThe consequences of their exclusion\u2014both for them and for the men they married and the children they raised\u2014would prove incalculable.\n\u201d 8 Feminist critiques have shown that the first generation of laws dealing with employment equity , childcare , eldercare , and sexual violence were inadequate to address the deep structural and cultural impediments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with careers.9 10 As Helen Macnaughtan observed in 2015 , \u201c [ t ] he lingering ideal of the male salaryman and the female shufu ( housewife ) is now hugely disconnected from social realities , but remains as an ideal because the alternative \u2013 the renegotiation of men , women , work and childcare \u2013 is complex.\n\u201d 11 Moreover , the growing disillusionment of Japanese women with the shufu role model has occurred within an economic context of increased precarity of employment since the Great Recession of the 1990s .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and females has meant that people are increasingly reluctant to commit to marriage and childrearing , which , in combination with a restrictive immigration policy , has meant that Japan is aging faster than any other large country.12 The Japanese population has been shrinking , from its historic high of 128.5 million in 2009 to 124.2 million in 2020 .\n( If this trend were to continue , there could be as few as 88 million people by 2055 , with 38 % of that population aged 65 or older , supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half to just 45 million . )\nEven under less alarming scenarios , and despite the stimulus afforded by Abenomics , Japan may find it increasingly difficult to encourage investment , avoid declining consumption of goods and services and deflation , manage its public debt ( already the world \u2019 s highest relative to GDP ) , or maintain its high standard of living .\nFrom a demographic perspective , the failure to restructure the gender order has produced the worst of both worlds : the rejection of the shufu model that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of economic opportunities , cultural changes and institutional supports that could enable Japanese women to effectively combine child-rearing with careers ( or contribute to raising productivity ) .\nIn 2020 , Japanese men still did less housework than their counterparts in any other developed country , while women got less sleep than any of their counterparts , according to the OECD.13 The postwar employment model and several aspects of its associated social compact are still firmly in place , despite this growing dysfunction , which explains how a G-7 country that ranked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Human Development Index has also slid to 121st out of 153 countries in the World Economic Forum \u2019 s Global Gender Gap Report ] , a drop of 40 places since 2006 .\nThe equality ranking is a composite of four sub-indices : a respectable 40th in health ; a more worrying 91st in educational attainment ; and a dismal 115th in economic opportunity and 144th in political empowerment\u2014the latter being by far the worst of any advanced industrial country .\nThis paradox ( no other country in the top 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom 50 of the WEF index of gender equality ) is largely attributable to Japan \u2019 s employment system , and to the inherent limitations of what Ayako Kano has called \u201c state feminism \u201d ( state sponsorship and co-optation of gender issues ) , particularly under the aegis of the LDP and Abe Shinzo.14At issue is whether a few recent major initiatives in the areas of the provision of childcare , parental leave , work hours and tax policy , in addition to a number of ambitious but completely voluntary targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate to address these demographic and economic challenges .\nContinued Structural Inertia in the Employment System and the \u2018 Breadwinner \u2019 Model Most scholars seeking to explain the very slow advancement of women in the Japanese economy , despite various types of legal support , stress that Japan \u2019 s lifetime employment and seniority-based system for elite workers was generally \u2018 rational \u2019 during the postwar period of high growth .\nJapanese firms anticipated an excess of labor demand over supply ; lifetime security increased retention rates and prevented the loss of firm-specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement schemes acted as a form of deferred payment that gave employees the incentive to work long term .\nSociologist Kazuo Yamaguchi has argued that this appearance of rationality may have been deceptive : the system only had a limited ( \u201c strategic \u201d ) rationality because of specific historical conditions and cultural assumptions that were emphasized or constructed at a particular socio-economic juncture , the irrationality of which only became apparent once Japan \u2019 s postwar period of rapid economic growth had passed .\nYamaguchi observes that the popular \u2018 cultural \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms \u2019 attributes to the Edo samurai household \u201c fails to explain why , barring a few exceptions , the Edo period samurai system was not widespread among Japanese companies during the Meiji , Taisho , and early Showa periods , and was only popularized during a period of rapid economic growth.\n\u201d 15 Nor does it explain why more elements of Japanese feudal agricultural households ( uji ) , in which males and females worked together , were not chosen instead .\nHe finds that \u201c institutional inertia \u201d was created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon strong job security and seniority-based wages , became established .\nThese possessed high stability notwithstanding the existence of other , more rationally desirable institutions , which could have better served to attract , develop , and retain female employees .\n\u201c From its inception , the Japanese employment system was created by overlooking the utilization of female personnel.\n\u201d 16 Under this system , opportunities for regular employment are scarce for those who leave the workforce , regardless of their experience or educational attainment , and regardless of whether they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of second chances technically applies to men as well , women experience far higher turnover rates during child-rearing ages , typically retiring from regular jobs upon marriage or the birth of a first child , and then returning to the workforce as non-regular workers after their children are grown .\nAs several leading Japanese labour scholars have stressed , regular employment in Japanese firms makes them \u201c membership-type \u201d organizations , and not just \u201c job-type \u201d ; \u201c kintract \u201d ( i.e .\nthe combination of kinship and contract , applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern corporate context as the quid pro quo for lifetime employment ) rather than simply \u201c contract \u201d .\nEven the Japanese bonus system , which pays almost all regular employees at the same rate depending on company sales or profits , is starkly different from most Western-style bonus systems , which reward individual performance .\nWhen pay is premised upon collective performance , both management and trade union peers can enforce corporate norms , including the expectation of long hours from regular employees\u2014an expectation premised upon the so-called \u2018 traditional \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females play the supporting role to the male breadwinner .\nThe lifetime employment system , the seniority-based wage system , and the Japanese-style bonus system all serve to reinforce employee acceptance of constraint in exchange for security , even though the actual beneficiaries of that social bargain represent a shrinking proportion of the population .\nYamaguchi \u2019 s game-theoretic analysis , which explains how the Japanese employment system displays strategic rationality at the expense of general economic rationality , is broadly consistent with feminist critiques of state feminism over the past three decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminist debates concerning the Equal Employment Opportunity Law ( EEOL ) shows how the elimination of paternalistic \u201c protections \u201d in the name of equality enabled more women to join the workforce , but the law was still heavily criticized by both liberal and radical feminists for caving in to business interests .\n\u201c The issue of workplace equality was left to the discretion of employers , who simply created a two-track system\u2014one that subverted the intent of the law and ensured that most women would remain in secondary positions in the workplace.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men to the managerial career track ( s\u014dg\u014d shoku ) even if they lacked college education , and the majority of women , including college graduates , to the clerical career track ( ippan shoku ) .\nStephanie Assmann argues that \u201c the EEOL has always been a guideline for private companies rather than a policy enforced by law .\n\u2026 Japanese companies have regularly evaded the EEOL by establishing a dual career track \u2026 system [ which ] continues to be practiced to maintain gender-specific employment conditions , without openly declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revised version of the EEOL in 2006/07 , which forbids indirect discrimination , challenges the dual track system by further constraining the conditions for hiring and promotion .\nNevertheless , those changes were implemented in the context of deregulation of the labour market , which limited progress against discrimination due to the rising tide of irregular and part-time employment.18 The growing prevalence of irregular employment may have also blunted the economic benefits of the 1999 Basic Law for a Gender Equal Society and the subsequent five-year Basic Plans for Gender Equality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadlines ( including several for 2020 ) as well as the promotion of work/life balance , child-rearing support and the development of policies to implement international standards .\nEconomic insecurity no doubt contributed to some of the backlash against state feminist initiatives from about 2000 to 2006 , much of it led by none other than Abe Shinz\u014d.19 Indeed , certain aspects of sexual discrimination in the workplace may have increased during and after Japan \u2019 s Great Recession of the 1990s , notwithstanding the legislative advances during that period .\nYamaguchi points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Japanese firms responded to recession and slower growth by replacing regular employment with non-regular employment through retirement and \u201c restructuring \u201d , thereby attempting to secure economic rent by keeping the wages of non-regular workers lower than their productivity .\nConsequently , the labour share of national income declined and corporations experienced a temporary improvement in their operating profits .\nBecause this defensive measure did not raise productivity , though , and in fact left most traditional regular employment practices untouched , it actually gave rise to a new form of discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in new-graduate regular employment , unlike during the period of rapid economic growth when new graduates could find regular employment regardless of gender.\n\u201d 20 But after the economic slowdown , more women could be slotted into the non-regular and ippan shoku ( regular , clerical ) positions exempt from long working hours .\nAt least this development gave Prime Minister Abe something to brag about until the COVID-19 crisis hit : a temporary boost in female employment .\nBeyond Tokenism ?\nRecent Legislation and its Limited Effects The effectiveness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for equal work and a labour market more conducive to work/life balance is difficult to gauge amidst the massive layoffs and revocations of informal job offers caused by the pandemic .\nAbe boldly pronounced that \u201c [ t ] hese are the first major reforms [ to labour laws ] in 70 years .\nWe will rectify the problems of working long hours and eradicate the expression \u2018 non-regular employment \u2019 from Japan.\n\u201d 21 Yet , as economist Naohiro Yashiro has pointed out , the formal prohibition against discrimination between regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large wage gap attributable to seniority-based pay , since employers are only obliged to pay equal wages to regular workers and non-regular workers with the same length of work experience at the same firm .\n\u201c It de-facto rationalises the current wage gap mainly based on the seniority wage of regular workers.\n\u201d 22 Moreover , the amendments enacted to improve pay and employment conditions for non-regular workers still do not explicitly refer to equality between men and women , and do not carry stiff penalties , but merely require employers to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee \u2019 s request .\nThis is consistent with the soft law \u2018 comply or explain \u2019 approach favoured by both the corporate sector and the governing Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) .\nYamaguchi \u2019 s analysis of the \u2018 gender wage gap \u2019 by a combination of employment types ( four categories distinguishing regular versus non-regular employment and full-time versus part-time work ) shows that gender differences in employment type explain only 36 percent of the gap.23 In fact , the primary factor is the wage differential within full-time regular employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage gap among regular workers is therefore a more pressing issue than fixing the overrepresentation of women in non-regular employment.\n\u201d 24 A major cause of this disparity is the small percentage of female managers in Japan .\nAccording to the 2017 Annual Report of the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare,25 women hold just 6.6 % of senior management positions ( department director or higher ) ; 9.3 % of middle management ( section heads ) ; and 18.6 % of lower management ( e.g.\n, task unit supervisor ) positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamaguchi \u2019 s research findings contradict employers \u2019 stated reasons for not promoting more women .\nThe two major reasons given by personnel officers in surveys are ( 1 ) \u201c at the moment , there are no women who have the necessary knowledge , experience , or judgment capability \u201d , and ( 2 ) \u201c women retire before attaining managerial positions due to their short years of service.\n\u201d 26 His analysis of firms with 100 or more employees shows that only 21 percent of the gender disparity among regular workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above could be explained by gender differences in education and employment experience .\nIn fact , \u201c the proportion of managers among female college graduates is far lower than that among male high school graduates , for any given number of years of employment for the current employer.\n\u201d 27 In all , about 60 % of the wage gap remains even after educational attainment , age , employment duration and working hours have all been equalized.28 The rest of the disparity arises from gender differences in the rate of promotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of education and experience .\n( Hence the proportion of section head positions that women attain on average after 26\u201330 years of employment is attained by men within 5 years . )\nYamaguchi surmises that the major underlying cause of gender inequality stems from the Japanese employment practice of promotion based upon seniority combined with indirect discrimination against women through firms \u2019 internal tracking systems .\nThis practice of statistical discrimination based upon the putative probability of temporary job-quitting becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy , since women often quit their jobs when raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing their careers in their firms.29 Given the wider influence of corporate/salaryman culture in Japanese society , it is not surprising to find that this pattern extends beyond the corporation to the professions as well : for example , the now-discredited practice at Tokyo Medical University ( and probably several other private universities ) of making deductions from entrance exam scores for more than 10 years to curb the enrollment of women .\nThis issue is deeply structural and highly resistant to ordinary incremental inducements and exhortations .\nThat is why Yamaguchi advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan \u2019 s Equal Employment Opportunity Law : In order to break through this present situation , the definition of indirect discrimination in Japan must be changed to comply with international standards , including , as discriminatory practices , institutions that have a disparate impact on the minority , rather than only institutions that are discriminatory in intention .\nIn particular , an essential requirement for gender equality of opportunity will be to prohibit by law internal tracking systems such as the distinction between the managerial career track and the clerical career track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employee \u2019 s gender , as an institution of indirect discrimination.30 Such proposals , though , run counter to the general policy ethos of deregulation .\nAfter not a single Japanese company took up the Ministry of Labour \u2019 s offer in April 2014 of between 150,000 and 300,000 yen apiece to train and promote women to supervisory roles , the government \u2019 s Gender Equality Bureau reduced the target for female section heads in businesses to just 15 % .\nIn June 2020 , it was announced that the 30 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade .\nIn June 2020 , the Minister of State for Gender Equality announced that the 30 % target would be delayed for up to a decade .\nMore importantly , there was still no indication that the new target would be mandatory or carry stiff penalties if not achieved .\nAt present , only 4 % of Japanese corporate board members are female , even though the stated goal for 2020 was 10 % ( most American and European companies are already over 20 % ) .\nThe government simply delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c to aim for a society where men and women alike are in leadership positions \u201d by 2050.31 Osawa Machiko , a labour economist at Japan Women \u2019 s University , states that the problem will not be solved until Japan \u201c develops a more liquid job market that would allow women to threaten to take their skills to other organisations.\n\u201d 32 Her analysis , like Yamaguchi \u2019 s , is consistent with a recent OECD study recommending the labour market reforms that are needed in order to enable Japan to better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts agree that breaking down labour market dualism is crucial to expanding employment opportunities for women and older people , while reducing income inequality and relative poverty .\nThis need not mean jettisoning the Japanese system in its entirety ( Macnaughton , for example holds out hope that \u201c core Japanese elements such as corporate loyalty and citizenship , commitment to investment in employee training and careers , and a priority for employee security before corporate profits can be extended to encompass female and non-regular employees \u201d ) , but it does mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure , collective bonuses , s\u014dg\u014d shoku/ippan shoku , and other aspects of the Japanese corporation that serve to reproduce gender inequality .\nThe rigidity and entrenchment of the system is why the gap between promise and performance is so pronounced in the area of parental leave .\nJapan \u2019 s generous Child Care and Family Leave Law has been in place since 2009 and childcare leave benefits have recently been increased from 50 % to 67 % of parents \u2019 existing salary for the first six months of leave , and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJapan even has the longest paid-leave for fathers in the world , 30.4 weeks , according to a 2019 UNICEF Report.34 The difficulty is that very few fathers use it .\nAccording to data compiled in the Ministry of Health , Labour and Welfare Basic Survey of Gender Equality in Employment Management for fiscal 2019 , only 7.48 percent of eligible men used childcare leave.35 ( By comparison , 62 % of eligible German fathers and 70 % of Swedish fathers took at least two months of paternity leave in 2015 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available leave of 30 % and 45 % respectively.36 ) Japan has experienced a steady incremental increase since 2011 , but the figure remains far below the government target of 13 % of fathers by 2020 and 30 % by 2025 .\nThe latter objective is unlikely to be achieved , but not because they are not interested .\nA 2017 Japanese government-commissioned study found that 35 % of new fathers wanted to take paternity leave but did not because they feared the repercussions for status and promotion.37 Although there continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation,38the persistent under-utilization of paternity leave in the face of both legislated incentives and popular support for the policy suggests that there exists not just a cultural lag , but a collective-action problem : i.e .\na situation in which individual rationality makes a collectively rational outcome impossible to achieve.39 As such , mandatory paternity leave may be necessary in order to break the impasse .\nIt would remove at a stroke the problem of intra-company competition deterring the use of parental leave , as well as the problem of inter-company competition pressuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal does not appear to be unacceptably radical for Japan , because in June 2019 50 Diet members , including 11 former Cabinet ministers , supported the idea.40 The expenditure of nearly 2 trillion yen in the 2017 budget to expand the scope of free education and childcare services , along with increasing childcare leave benefits and the reform of the dependent spouse tax deduction ( which had discouraged women from entering the labour force by giving a tax benefit to married couples if a spouse \u2014 in most cases the wife \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more than just token measures .\nSo are some of the revisions to Japan \u2019 s labor laws .\nAs of April 1 , 2019 large firms ( defined as firms with 300 or more employees ) were required by the aforementioned Workstyle Reform Law to comply with a new overtime Basic Limit of 45 hours per month and 360 hours per year , although under \u201c special circumstances \u201d this can be extended to 100 hours per month and 720 hours per year.41 It also carries a penalty for non-compliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment for up to six months or fines of up to 300,000 Yen .\nAlthough it is not clear how much this directly affects women , given their small presence in the regular workforce , it does strike a blow against the prevalent \u2018 more is always better \u2019 attitude toward male working hours .\nNevertheless , these measures reflect a narrow , compartmentalized strategy that is tailored to impose minimal restraint upon business .\nThey may not be sufficient to engineer the kind of rapid structural , cultural , and societal transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertility rate in 2020 remains stuck at 1.369 births per woman ( replacement rate is 2.1 per woman ) , and the cost of females not participating in the workforce on an equal basis with males is estimated by Goldman Sachs to be almost 13 % of GDP.42 The reluctance of Japan \u2019 s political elites to adopt a more comprehensive and aggressive approach is more baffling considering their resistance to mass immigration , which is the only feasible policy alternative to Womenomics for stemming the effects of demographic decline .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need 650,000 immigrants per year to stabilize the nation \u2019 s population ( the actual number of net immigrants in 2019 was 165,000 ) .\nAlthough the majority of Japanese people surveyed are not opposed to gradually increasing immigration to meet labour shortages , there is official opposition to creating a large , permanent immigrant community.43 One reason for this is the difficulty that was experienced in integrating the 370,000 nikkeijin ( ethnic Japanese born in Brazil and Latin America ) between 1990 and 2010 .\nThat policy failure suggested that unfamiliarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious obstacle to reliance upon immigration as the primary policy instrument for solving Japan \u2019 s demographic dilemmas.44 Japan therefore needs to ask how seriously it takes , or ever took , the goal of raising its fertility rate from under 1.4 to 1.8 by 2025 .\nFrance furnishes perhaps the most relevant international comparison because it successfully used public policy to raise its fertility rate from 1.7 to nearly 1.9 in just 10 years between 1993 and 2003 .\nThe French began precisely where conservative Japan has thus far feared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most liberal definition of family possible , to include unwed couples , adoptions , same-sex couples , and single parents .\nFrench maternity leave ( fully paid for sixteen weeks per child for the first two children and twenty-six weeks in the case of a third child , with an additional monthly stipend that rises with the number of children ) can be split with partners , with an additional eleven days of paternity leave reserved exclusively for fathers .\nA mother can also take an additional two and a half years without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to her job ( up to five years leave if there is more than one child ) .\nFrench law requires that at least 40 percent of directors be women ( or not fewer than the number of men minus two for smaller corporations ) .\nYet Japan purportedly seeks to raise its fertility rate twice as much as France by doing considerably less .\nMoreover , France \u2019 s current fertility rate of 1.85 births per woman is due to French-born mothers giving birth at a rate of about 1.75 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who in 2017 averaged 0.8 more ( all told , immigrant mothers contributed 18\u201319 % of French births in 2017 ) .45Japan \u2019 s reluctance to greatly increase its levels of immigration means that it is even more reliant than France is upon its domestic fertility rate , making its task that much more difficult .\nAlthough the number of children waiting to enter authorized daycare facilities in Japan as of April 2019 was the lowest ( 16,772 ) it had been since records started in 1994 , new demands arising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the age of two from low income households , coupled with a growing shortage of childcare workers eating into the profitability of private preschools and daycare centers , means that the goal of eliminating waiting lists remains elusive.46 To achieve its ambitious goals for both increasing female labour participation and raising birth rates , however , Japan should probably take a page from Scandinavia and the Netherlands and not just from France .\nThat is : it should supplement these social policy supports with policies that take more direct aim at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different job categories .\nThere is also more that can be done in other areas of family law and social policy , such as providing more support for ( or at least fewer impediments to ) single parents , unmarried parents and gay couples who may wish to raise families .\nOpposition parties submitted a bill in 2019 that proposed legalizing same-sex marriage , but the Abe government declined to debate it , on the grounds that same-sex marriage is prohibited by Article 24 of the Constitution , which states that \u201c marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent of both sexes.\n\u201d That conservative interpretation of Article 24 is currently being challenged in the courts , and the Japanese Bar Association has recommended that Article 24 be interpreted so as to not deny the Article 14 guarantee of Equality.47 The first judgement in this case is expected in the Sapporo District Court on 17 March 2021.Some prefectures have issued partnership certificates to same-sex couples,48 and the trend in public opinion is unmistakeable : according to a poll carried out by Dentsu in October 2018 , 78.4 % of Japanese people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour of same-sex marriage.49 It is telling however that the national government is more of a hindrance than a help to recognizing non-traditional family structures , notwithstanding its ostensible commitment to promoting adoptions and to facilitating the careers of all women and couples who decide to raise children.50 Tokenism in the Political Arena : Gender Inequality and the LDP Abe Shinz\u014d acknowledged the need to complement efforts to promote female managers in the private sector with those to encourage both elected and non-elected officials in the public sector .\nNevertheless , his government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the glass ceiling at the highest reaches of government .\nFirst , the issue of female succession to the Throne of Japan : the existing Imperial House Law of 1947 remains a clear affirmation of patriarchy and patriliny in a country that needs just the opposite.51Second , Abe allowed the number of women in his Cabinet to slide from seven in 2014 , just after Womenomics was announced , to just two in 2020 , a number maintained by his successor , PM Suga Yoshihide .\nThird , the lack of female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s electoral system allows for 176 members of the House of Representatives and 96 members of the House of Councillors to be elected from party lists in accordance with proportional representation ( PR ) .\nIn most countries with a PR-element in their electoral system , political parties use PR-lists in multi-member constituencies in order to enhance and ensure female and minority representation .\nEmma Dalton \u2019 s work describes how the replacement of the multi-member Single Non-Transferrable Vote with the mixed-member plurality system in the electoral reform of 1994 raised hopes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not materialize due to a series of moves by LDP politicians calculated to defuse its radical potential .\nOne aspects of this was the steady reduction in the number of PR seats ( from one-half or 250 in the original proposal of the Hosokawa government , to 226 in the compromise negotiated by Hosokawa with the LDP in November 1993 ; to the 200 PR elected in 11 regional blocs that was included in the 1994 law and used in the 1996 general election , to 176 out of 480 seats used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nArguably even more important was a provision in the 1994 law allowing dual candidacies across the two electoral segments ( the \u201c zombie \u201d clause ) , which protected the careers of incumbents and thus greatly reduced opportunities for women .\nMost parties , in particular the LDP , resisted calls for quotas .\nSome campaign finance reforms limited the power of private money and provided some modest government funding of parties , but these measures had only modest effect , with female representation in the Diet rising from 2.7 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 , and then levelling off.52 The political reforms of 1994 also gave the PM increased powers in order to curb the cost and frequency of elections and to reduce the scope for local pork-barrel politics , corruption and factionalism .\nThese powers helped Abe to achieve a more cohesive cabinet , greater political stability and to eventually become , in 2019 , Japan \u2019 s longest-serving prime minister .\nHe was also able to overcome the veto power of the agricultural lobby and other domestic constraints in order to become a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Trump \u2019 s withdrawal of the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nNevertheless , he allowed the LDP to repeatedly water down a multi-party bill aimed at promoting the recruitment of female candidates .\nWhy was the law eventually adopted in 2018 calling for parties to \u201c aim for \u201d balanced gender representation among candidates in elections not made binding , at least with respect to the PR-list seats ?\nAs it happens , in the first local elections held under the new law in April 2019 , a record six out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women .\nIn prefectural assembly elections , women constituted 12.7 percent of candidates , winning 10.4 percent of those seats .\nThis was a slight increase over the 9.1 percent of prefectural assembly seats that went to women in 2015 .\nIn the July 2019 Upper House election , the percentage of female candidates rose from 24.7 percent in the 2016 election to 28.1 percent , winning 28 out of the 124 seats ( 22.5 percent ) .\nThese numbers were all modest improvements , but they could have been significantly better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for proportional elections had been gender-balanced to begin with .\nIt was also telling that only 15 percent of LDP candidates were women , compared with 45 percent for their main opponents , the Constitutional Democratic Party ( CDP ) .53 Qualitative research confirms the continuing prevalence of a patriarchal party culture in the LDP , including the norms internalized by LDP women themselves.54 These missed opportunities reflect both the government \u2019 s narrow conception of Womenomics as simply part of an economic growth strategy , and the social conservatism of Abe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The short-term success of the first two arrows of Abenomics ( monetary easing and fiscal stimulus ) meant that between 2012 and 2019 the government had been able to postpone or avoid actions that were less politically popular among its core constituencies .\nAs Jeff Kingston observes , \u201c Abe \u2019 s \u2018 Three Arrows \u2019 strategy suffers because the third arrow of structural reforms remains in the quiver .\n\u2026 [ F ] inancial markets rejoiced that the Bank of Japan was underwriting guaranteed stock gains\u2026 [ while ] increased government spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generates jobs in rural areas where longstanding LDP activists reside.\n\u201d 55 No comparable constituency exists for Womenomics , which is basically a public good .\nThe lack of a strong centre-left Opposition party after the implosion of the Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in 2012 has meant that there is no longer an alternative government-in-waiting to compete on the basis of a more progressive program .\nThis power vacuum has undoubtedly boosted the relative influence of the Nippon Kaigi ( the \u201c Japan Conference \u201d ) , the conservative right-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Cabinet .\n( Although Nippon Kaigi has also included some important female leaders , such as former defense minister Inada Tomomi , it is hardly known for promoting feminist policies . )\n56 During the campaign to secure the succession of Abe as President of the LDP , neither the eventual winner , now Prime Minister Suga , nor the other leading candidates ( Ishiba Shigeru and Kishida Fumio ) proposed to do more than \u201c push for female hiring targets and more progress on child-care provision.\n\u201d 57 Members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely heavily for advice and support , are also complicit in this policy drift .\nIn 2017 , Keidanren agreed to foot 300 billion yen ( US $ 2.7 billion ) of the 2 trillion yen daycare and education initiative of the government , to be paid in the form of employer contributions under the employee pension insurance system.58 Japan still , however , lacks an official evaluation system to check the daily operations of nursery facilities , and suffers from low pay for qualified daycare workers , resulting in an acute labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour may prove attractive to foreign companies looking to open private daycare centres,59 but they also arguably neglect the quality of educational and daycare services , which is what matters most to working parents .\nCapital markets also stepped up to the plate , as when , in 2018 , the Corporate Governance Code set out by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Agency was revised to stipulate that at least one female board member was \u201c expected \u201d to be in position at every listed company .\nNikkei Asia reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] ompanies in Japan will be encouraged to set voluntary targets for female and foreign managers and provide information on their progress under a revised corporate governance code due out in the spring of 2021.\n\u201d 60 Kathy Matsui , reflecting in 2019 upon the progress of Womenomics over the previous two decades , expressed a measured satisfaction that it had \u201c helped shift corporate managers \u2019 and societal attitudes to the critical role gender diversity can play in driving growth \u201d and \u201c while Japan is still far from reaching its targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made in other areas.\n\u201d Matsui recommends that Japan consider temporary quotas for the Japanese Diet , but\u2013despite reiterating the stakes , in terms of implications for productivity , economic growth , and standards of living , of gender inequality and depopulation\u2014does not recommend stronger regulation of the private sector.61 That is because \u2018 Womenomics \u2019 keeps bumping into another glass ceiling : the need to cohere with the other \u201c Arrows \u201d of Abenomics and with business imperatives .\nGoldman Sachs , Keidranen and other business elite organisations are committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other market-oriented policies to maximize growth .\nLobbyists have successfully persuaded the government to follow a neoliberal prescription that preserves managerial autonomy,62 a shift to more regressive expenditure taxes , and deregulation .\nThese lobbyists and advisers in the private sector have not , however , been inclined to advocate quotas for hiring and board representation , a broader definition and stronger regulation of indirect discrimination in the workplace , higher minimum wages , or mandatory paternity leave .\nConclusion : Womenomics and the Limits of Neoliberal Reform It is undeniable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe government in Japan saw a move beyond mere tokenism and symbolism in certain key policy areas relating to Womenomics .\nThe investments in daycare , parental leave , and the cap on working hours are significant , if not exactly transformational .\nThe long-criticized ceiling for the spousal tax deduction was finally raised from 1.03 million yen to 1.5 million yen , encouraging more women to work\u2014although out of political sensitivity to many women who are still full-time homemakers , the tax deduction framework remains firmly in place.63 The new Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is committed to giving renewed momentum to the \u2018 third arrow \u2019 of structural reform , including labour market reforms that would promote gender equity.64 Nevertheless , these recent innovations do not fundamentally alter the validity of Helen Macnaughtan \u2019 s conclusion that the system continues to serve the \u201c ideal of core regular male employment , \u201d and that until that model is dismantled , genuine progress for both men and women will be impossible to achieve .\nNor have they disproven Jeff Kingston \u2019 s prediction in 2014 of \u201c a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abe government in response to the growing needs of the precariat , women , youths , and immigrants .\nThe case has not been convincingly made that continued incrementalism , with heavy reliance upon voluntary targets and disclosure requirements , is sufficient to achieve the dramatic change that Japan needs .\nIt is still rational for too many employers to bet against women staying in the workforce to the same extent as men ; for fathers to not take the full paternity leave to which they are entitled ; and for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to their talents with the raising of families .\nThe complaint from corporations that not enough female talent was in the pipeline to meet the 2020 hiring targets for managers was the self-fulfilled prophecy of a discriminatory dual track career system .\nIn the face of such an entrenched system of gender inequality , to base one \u2019 s optimism on the idea that the \u201c critical tailwinds \u201d of social investment and generational culture change will serve to blow Japan across the finish line65 is to miss the historical lesson that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashioned \u201c Japan Inc. \u201d This may be needed again to forge a more inclusive and egalitarian political economy that fits 21stcentury realities .\nThe paradox of the Abe-era reforms is how extensive legislation and publicity efforts to change the system nonetheless tiptoed very carefully around the same political coalitions between conservative policymakers , politicians , large firms , and core regular workers that consolidated labor market dualism and inequality during Japan \u2019 s protracted recession of the 1990s and 2000s .\nBy not offending these key constituencies , the LDP may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so doing may have jeopardized Japan \u2019 s long-term growth and progress .\nIn contrast , by reducing the distinctions between regular and non-regular employment ; prohibiting internal tracking systems that have highly gendered effects ; making targets for female managers and Board appointments mandatory ; making paternity leave compulsory ; reserving half of the Diet \u2019 s PR-list seats for female candidates ; and strongly supporting parents regardless of their gender , sexual orientation or marital status , Suga could break some of the vicious circles that prevented Abe \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To make Womenomics work , Japanese neoliberalism must bend to the requirements of gender equality , and not just the other way around .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost

evolution has hewn a remarkable cast of curious species living on the islands .\nFew animal families in Southeast Asia exemplify this speciation over generations more aptly than pigs , or \u201c suids , \u201d if you \u2019 re a biologist .\nThere are several varieties of both warty and bearded pigs , as well as a short-slung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porculagenus called the pygmy hog .\nSeveral Babyrousa species stalk the islands of Indonesia , sporting tusk-like canines that burst from their skulls like an animal from the pages of Arthur Conan Doyle \u2019 s The Lost World .\nIn all , scientists have found 11 suid species in Southeast Asia .\nConfined in some cases to just a few islands , these species tend to have naturally small populations .\nThat , combined with surging human settlement and the related loss of the pig habitat to deforestation for timber and agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2016 , for example , scientists estimated that only about 1,000 adult Togian babirusa ( Babyrousa togeanensis ) lived on its namesake island chain in Indonesia .\nWith such small populations , these pigs teeter on a precarious edge , where a single calamity \u2014 such as a deadly disease to which they have no developed immune response \u2014 could wipe them out , and it \u2019 s put scientists on alert across Southeast Asia .\nImage on the right : A Sulawesi babirusa ( Babyrousa celebensis )

the islands of Sumatra , Java and Borneo , said Matthew Luskin , a wildlife ecologist at Australia \u2019 s University of Queensland and the study \u2019 s lead author , in an email to Mongabay

disease could still reverberate through ecosystems and human communities across the region , the authors write .\nImage below : Critically endangered Sumatran tigers , pictured here in Indonesia , rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their range .\nImage by Rhett A. Butler/Mongabay .\nOn the surface , the disease imperils the survival of Southeast Asia \u2019 s wild pig species , several of which are listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red

efficacy of control measures in Southeast Asia is scant .\nSo Luskin and his colleagues set out to figure out what \u2019 s known about the disease and where the gaps lie .\nThe team began by plotting out the known outbreaks of the disease , starting with its arrival in China in mid-2018 .\nFrom their examination of shipping data , they concluded that the disease likely spread through trade .\nIn Africa , where the disease originated , ticks harbor the virus and carry it between pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven \u2019 t yet determined if Asian tick species are also a vector .\nOnce the virus surfaces , wild boars , which are the same species ( Sus scrofa ) as domestic pigs and the most ubiquitous wild pig in Southeast Asia , help circulate the disease .\nThe scientists also mapped out the known ranges of each of the region \u2019 s 11 wild pig species .\nThey then assigned an overall risk of each pig species \u2019 or subspecies \u2019 susceptibility to ASF based on factors such as the density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for pork and pig farming in the area , each species \u2019 conservation status , and whether it overlaps with wild boar territories .\nAn infographic tracking the timeline and geographic spread of African swine fever in Asia .\nImage by Luskin et al.\n, 2020 .\nThe risk posed by ASF to the hairy babirusa ( Babyrousa babyrussa ) \u2014 literally \u201c deer-pig \u201d in Indonesian \u2014 is relatively low .\nHuman communities in its range are sparsely populated , and neither pig farming nor pork consumption is very common .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sus cebifrons ) , which lives in six of the Visayan Islands in the central Philippines , is at \u201c very high \u201d risk : There \u2019 s a lot of trade in pigs and pork within its range , and the species \u2019 numbers are already low enough to warrant a designation of critically endangered by the IUCN .\nLowering these risks and minimizing the losses to both wildlife and people will require a host of solutions , the authors write , many relying on a precautionary approach advocated by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for the wildlife and veterinarian authorities to be extremely vigilant and treat suspicious deaths of wild pigs very seriously , \u201d Goossens said in an email .\nHe and the Danau Girang staff are currently working with Malaysian authorities to determine what killed as many as 60 Sunda bearded pigs ( Sus barbatus barbatus ) in early February 2021 .\nFajar Sumping , Indonesia \u2019 s animal health director with the Ministry of Agriculture , told Mongabay that the ministry has been communicating with provincial veterinarians to prepare for possible ASF outbreaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a health information system for animals called i-sikhnas , which allows veterinarians and farmers alike to report suspected cases of animal disease for follow-up .\n\u201c Through infographics that we distribute on social media , radio and ground campaign , \u201d Fajar said , \u201c the public are being informed and educated to actively participate in recognizing the symptoms of ASF , how to report them and how to carry out simple biosecurity actions.\n\u201d Image below : A Sunda bearded pig ( Sus barbatus ) in Malaysian Borneo .\nImage by Quinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nLuskin noted that certain biosecurity measures , such as testing , the proper disposal of carcasses , and controlling the movement of animals and trade , are more feasible for large pork producers .\nBut they are \u201c practically impossible \u201d for small family farms , he said .\nThat means authorities will need to exert more control over the pork trade , even halting it completely if an outbreak is suspected .\nHe and his colleagues also said that collecting saliva samples for testing from wild pigs using bait could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease might be spreading , along with stepping up in-the-field monitoring .\n\u201c What may [ be ] useful is the enhanced surveillance with active patrolling to look for dead wild boar and immediate testing and imposing restrictions to infected areas , \u201d Sheherazade , a conservation scientist with WCS and co-author of the study , said in an email .\nCommunities living near wild pig ranges will be crucial to curbing disease transmission , Luskin said .\n\u201c [ L ] ocal traditional , commercial or recreational hunters are the first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are likely the first to notice whether and where the disease is affecting wild populations , \u201d he said .\nImage on the right : Wild pigs also help sustain Javan leopards , another critically endangered carnivore in Southeast Asia .\nImage by Anaxibia via Wikimedia Commons ( CC BY-SA 3.0 ) .\nThe authors also write that the scientific community needs to invest in continued research to determine which vectors pose the greatest risk .\nScientists also don \u2019 t currently have enough data about the ecology of these animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live in , the team writes .\nNor do they have up-to-date numbers for many of the species , apart from a general consensus that the populations are generally pretty small .\nIt \u2019 s that last point that is particularly concerning .\nElsewhere , pigs can and have adapted to live with ASF .\nIn Africa , the disease lies in wait more or less harmlessly in warthogs ( Phacochoerus africanus ) , and even domestic pigs seem to have evolved some ability to cope with the disease since it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago .\n\u201c If the disease persists across Asia , and there is no doubt that it will , \u201d Luskin said , \u201c then at some point in time it will similarly become endemic.\n\u201d The question then becomes whether the small \u2014 tiny , in some instances \u2014 populations of Southeast Asia \u2019 s distinctive wild pig species will be able \u201c to buffer the high mortalities of the initial outbreaks , \u201d he said , with the region \u2019 s ecological health hanging

towards the Rohingyas for her inactions , as head of government she was in no position to admit to the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very much a part of her government .\nToday that is a proven fact despite her best efforts .\nAnd to make matters worse the military government has charged her with crimes to legally silence her .\nThe November elections demonstrated her continued popularity among

ultimately , is their land .\nThe three Acts are an integral part of a larger policy , the result of which will be to part peasants from their land .\nIndeed , just a few months ago , the rulers themselves were keen to advertise this fact to corporate investors .\nIn his speech of May 12 , announcing the \u201c Corona package \u201d , Modi said : \u201c In order to prove the resolve of a self-reliant India , Land , Labor , Liquidity and Laws all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What \u201c Land \u201d was he referring to ?\nTwo days later , the Chief Economic Advisor , Krishnamurthy Subramanian , spelled out what the Prime Minister meant : \u201c Land and labour are really factor market reforms [ in textbook economics , Land , Labour and Capital are the three \u2018 factors of production \u2019 \u2014 RUPE ] because these are factor inputs that really affect the cost of doing business and you have seen a lot of changes on these recently at state level .\nUttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states are also in line to follow up\u2026 .\nKarnataka had just gone ahead and changed the regulation on acquisition of land for business .\nLand can now be directly bought from farmers in the state and other states will also imbibe the model.\n\u201d The old land reform law in Karnataka prevented direct acquisition of land by private business , in order to protect peasants from force and fraud .\nThe removal of this protection [ 1 ] in December 2020 was immediately welcomed by big business .\nIn line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corona crisis , the Modi government initiated two measures : drone-based mapping of all residential areas in the rural areas ; and a model legislation for states to implement \u2018 conclusive \u2019 land titling .\nBefore we discuss these steps , let us briefly state the argument of this article .\n( 1 ) Over the last two decades , international agencies and the Indian government have explicitly been preparing the ground for transfer of the lands of poor peasants .\nThey term this the creation of \u201c vibrant land sales markets \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small to be a viable source of livelihood.\n\u201d ( 2 ) In pursuit of this aim , the Indian government is trying to establish a system of \u2018 conclusive titling \u2019 of all land in the country , whereby the State would permanently guarantee the title of the title-holder against any other claimants .\nThe Niti Aayog is accordingly pushing state governments to adopt a draft \u2018 conclusive titling \u2019 bill .\n( 3 ) In our country , land continues to be the single largest source of livelihood and sustenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically established , claims on it .\nThese claims need to be determined and satisfied through a social process , not a mere administrative one .\nThe present rapid forced-march of conclusive titling and digitizing land records threatens to oust large numbers of poor peasants from the most important rural means of production .\n( 4 ) This process is actually driven , not by the needs of the poor peasants , but the needs of international and domestic corporate investors , who want , from remote locations , to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( 5 ) Ongoing changes and growing uncertainties in the world economy , as well as those anticipated in the world climate and environment , have fueled a drive on the part of international agribusinesses and financial investors to get control of land , including agricultural land , in the Third World .\nAt the same time , in the neoliberal era , Third World economies have opened themselves to foreign investment further and further , and ( in line with this ) scrapped step by step their existent legal restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOne such global trend is the growth of organised retail , generally linked to foreign investment .\nThis is leading to \u201c the corporate takeover of the domestic food systems of the developing countries as a whole.\n\u201d [ 2 ] This process reorients Third World countries \u2019 agriculture away from staple crops for domestic consumption , toward fresh fruits , vegetables , and other produce demanded in the developed world and by the Third World countries \u2019 domestic elites .\nDomestic food security systems are dismantled , and Third World countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed countries ( which have large surpluses of these grains ) .\nForeign and domestic corporate investors \u2019 penetration of the agricultural sector of a Third World country spurs the \u201c concentration and foreignization \u201d [ 3 ] of land .\n( 6 ) Three decades of neoliberal restructuring of India \u2019 s agriculture have led to an acute crisis , manifested most starkly by the suicides of over 3,00,000 peasants since the late 1990s .\nOfficial data reveal that the poor peasantry is squeezed , with their farm income not covering even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , they are unwilling to part with their land .\nTheir stubborn resistance is due to their knowledge that other secure livelihoods are not emerging ( indeed , are disappearing ) , and that land and access to common property resources can still yield some subsistence for the peasant family .\nHowever , the corporate takeover of India \u2019 s food system will press upon the various sections of the Indian peasantry in multiple ways .\nThe winding up of official procurement will reduce farmgate prices for foodgrains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift to growing crops demanded by corporates , in a desperate attempt to meet their consumption expenditures .\nBut the specifications and investments demanded by organised retail and by exporters are unaffordable for these small producers .\nMeanwhile , the winding down of the Public Distribution System will raise the consumption costs of peasants in other regions , including in tribal areas .\nAll these trends will intensify the debt crisis of different sections of the peasantry , and lead to parting them from their land .\nThe kisans are not misled .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long-term interest .\nIt is also in the national interest , by defending the food security and land of the country .\nIt is thus a direct heir to the legacy of the struggles of India \u2019 s peasantry under British rule .\nWe now proceed to elaborate the above .\nOne of the key elements of the neoliberal \u2018 reform \u2019 process has been the transferring of control over land .\nAs is well known , the Modi government in its first term tried to dilute or virtually scrap various provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rehabilitation and Re-settlement Act , 2013 [ 5 ] , against the interests of peasants , and in favour of forcible land acquisition .\nThat attempt at amendment had to be dropped by the rulers in the face of opposition both by peasant organisations and parliamentary parties , but the rulers plan to bring it back : According to a former member of the Prime Minister \u2019 s Economic Advisory Council ( PMEAC ) , \u201c With the ruling party expected to be placed comfortably from November 2020 it is hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 ] However , the process of separating peasants from their land is not limited to the acquiring of land for industrial , infrastructural , mining or real estate projects .\nIt is also part of the re-structuring of India \u2019 s agriculture in the interests of monopoly capital .\nAs part of this process , the neo-liberalizers wish to first fix ownership of the land on some person , whether or not that person has the exclusive right to it , so that ownership can thereafter be transferred to others .\nFor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land rights to a purely managerial question of improving the efficiency of land administration , which is the opposite of the truth .\nThey have always been quite clear in stating the aim of this exercise : to facilitate the transfer of land .\n( Toward the same end , they have also been pushing for a new law for the leasing of land , aimed at promoting the leasing of small peasants \u2019 land to large landholders . )\nA 2001 report by the leading international consulting firm , McKinsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that \u201c most , even 90 per cent by one estimate , of the land titles in India are \u2018 unclear \u2019 \u201d .\n[ 7 ] One reason for this unclear status , it claimed , is the strength of tenancy rights in India : \u201c both legal as well as illegal occupants gain de facto rights on the property they occupy , increasing the time and paperwork needed before the real owner can fully exercise his right to sell the property \u201d .\n[ 8 ] In McKinsey \u2019 s view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachers , without legitimate claims ; only \u201c real owners \u201d have legitimate claims .\nIn fact , such tenancy rights as exist in India \u2019 s lawbooks are the legacy of fierce struggles by India \u2019 s peasantry over decades .\nThese struggles , to one extent or another , established the social claim that those who actually work the land have a primary right on its fruits , not those who extract rent of one kind or another on the basis of paper titles .\nIt is clear that what McKinsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually a social question , a struggle between classes for possession and fruits of the land .\nIn a 2007 document , the World Bank claimed that traditional land reform in India ( abolition of intermediaries , tenancy legislation , and ceilings on land ownership ) , was no longer beneficial ; indeed it was now turning harmful .\n[ 9 ] Land reform laws affected \u201c the efficiency with which land is used by land reform beneficiaries as well as landowners targeted by land reform \u201d .\nIn other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was necessary to do away with land reform laws .\nIn their place , the World Bank laid out a new charter : \u201c Expand computerization , integration , and use of textual records to ensure full coverage [ of land ] .\nProvide a basis for statewide spatial coverage .\nAllow private sector participation in surveying , focusing government on a regulatory role.\n\u201d Finally , it said , \u201c Eliminate restrictions on land markets \u201d , by legalising leasing of land ; removing ceilings on rent ; removing restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to non-agriculturalists ; and allowing direct acquisition of agricultural land by investors ( i.e.\n, without Government mediation ) .\nGoing further , the Columbia University economist Arvind Panagariya , in his best-selling book India : The Emerging Giant ( 2008 ) , called for \u201c state-guaranteed titles \u201d to land as a prerequisite for a \u201c highly efficient land market in India \u201d : Indeed , it was the Congress-led UPA government that , in August 2008 , launched the \u201c National Land Records Modernisation Programme \u201d ( NLRMP ) , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of conclusive , State-guaranteed titles of land ownership .\n[ 10 ] It appears that the state governments gave their assent , and sent in their plans for implementation of this scheme .\nProgress , however , was slower than the rulers wished , and the Economic Survey 2012-13 , prepared under Raghuram Rajan , called for accelerating the NLRMP \u201c to map land carefully and assign conclusive title \u201d , and bring about \u201c greater liquidity for land \u201d .\nIn 2014 , the new Modi government made Panagariya the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aayog , and he set about creating the land market of his dreams .\nA 2015 paper of the Niti Aayog states : Thus neither international agencies nor successive governments , from the Congress-led UPA to the present Modi government , were ever coy to state their intent to part the \u201c unviable \u201d farmer from his or her plot of land through \u201c vibrant land sales markets \u201d .\nMaking use of the Covid-19 crisis In April 2020 , as India reeled under the world \u2019 s harshest lockdown \u2013 the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partition \u2013 commentators in the business press called for the Government to use the occasion to ram through politically difficult measures : \u201c While the need to unleash the power of land was never in doubt , the coronavirus crisis has given us an opportunity to make it happen now.\n\u201d Panagariya called on the Government not \u201c to let the crisis go to waste \u201d , pointing out \u201c The crisis\u2026 gives the government the opportunity to introduce reforms in areas of land and labour markets that are harder in \u2018 peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the height of the lockdown , the Prime Minister launched a new project , \u2018 SVAMITVA \u2019 ( Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas ) , for drone surveys to map all residential houses in rural areas .\nOnce this is done , state governments would issue property cards for these houses to village households .\n( Note that this merely formalises existing home ownership ; those who do not have house sites will not benefit from this scheme . )\nApart from demarcation of individual rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets like village roads , ponds , canals , open spaces , schools , anganwadis , health sub-centres , etc .\nwould also be surveyed and maps would be created .\nWhy did the Government accord such urgency to this scheme ?\nThe Government claims this would \u201c increase liquidity of land parcels in the market \u201d ( i.e.\n, facilitate sales of property ) .\nMoreover , it is likely that , having set up a sizeable physical infrastructure and trained personnel for drone-based mapping in the rural areas , the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural land as well .\nIn 2008 , the UPA government undertook the National Land Records Modernisation Programme ( NLRMP ) , with the aim of establishing \u2018 conclusive titling \u2019 of land in India .\nThis was revamped in 2014 by the Modi government as the \u201c Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme \u201d ( DILRMP ) .\nTaking this further , in November 2020 , the NITI Aayog released a model Land Titling Act , which it is pressing state governments to adopt ( land being a state , not Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state governments signed on to the NLRMP , they may well agree to adopt such legislations in their respective states now .\nA bit of background is required to understand the significance of the above step .\nLand accounts for 73 per cent of the assets of rural households ( buildings , located on that land , account for another 21 per cent ) .\n[ 12 ] Who owns , who possesses , who has a right to the fruits of , who has specific use rights in , and who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple questions in India ; nor are they merely technical or administrative questions , but social ones , which must be determined through a social process .\nThere are multiple layers of land rights , often belonging to different persons .\nAnd these can be questions of life and death for those affected .\nAt present , India has a system of \u2018 presumptive \u2019 land titles , whereby the State does not guarantee land titles ; evidence of ownership is provided by sale deeds , tax revenue receipts , etc .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer of a property , for which the prospective buyer frequently carries out a \u2018 title search \u2019 of existing documents .\nUnder a system of \u2018 conclusive \u2019 titling , titles to property are registered with , and guaranteed by , the State .\nIn order to institute such a system , it is necessary to conclusively determine ownership of all land , including the claims of creditors , and the rights of other parties such as tenants .\nOnce such a determination is made , the State will guarantee the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuch a system is known internationally as a \u201c Torrens system.\n\u201d Not all developed countries have it .\nIndeed it is not prevalent even in most states of the United States .\nLegal scholar Jonathan Zasloff points out that , since land registration documents are to be accepted or rejected by bureaucrats , the present drive for a Torrens system provides enormous potential for bureaucratic corruption .\n[ 13 ] The official record will be determined by powerful vested interests .\nIndia \u2019 s history provides ample evidence of this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the landlord monopoly on land , failed utterly in India .\nThe historic report of the official Task Force on Agrarian Relations ( 1973 ) frankly admitted that such reforms never stood a chance : \u201c Considering the character of the power structure obtaining in the country it was only natural that the required political will was not forthcoming.\n\u201d [ 14 ] More recently too , the official Committee on State Agrarian Relations and Unfinished Task of Land Reforms ( 2009 ) pointed to \u201c deep collusion between the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic structure \u201d .\n( 2 ) An estimated 200 million people ( Scheduled Tribes and other forest dwellers ) were to be covered under the Forest Rights Act of 2006 .\nTo date , just 4.1 million individual titles have been distributed , representing about 20 million people , or 10 per cent of the projected coverage .\nThe situation is even worse with regard to community forest rights ( CFR ) : just 3 per cent of the potential CFR area has been established to date .\nEven the much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and improving their share of the produce , was never attempted in most of the country .\nNo doubt West Bengal carried out a major programme ( \u2018 Operation Barga \u2019 ) in 1978-82 , during which officials camped at 8,000 sites , and peasant organisations of the ruling Left Front mobilised sharecroppers to get registered .\nYet even this covered only half the sharecroppers and half the sharecropped land , and more or less came to a halt by the mid-1980s .\n[ 15 ] Further , as Zasloff notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protected , \u201c the question of who should own the land can not be avoided \u201d : Thus the Torrens system represents the final and formal burial of land reform ; for once the State itself is the guarantor of the owner \u2019 s title , what question is there of the same State redistributing land to the landless ?\nThis despite the fact that there is much land to be redistributed , and ( to quote the 2009 Committee on State Agrarian Relations ) \u201c The country will never be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty without land reforms , including redistributive measures and security of tenure and ownership , prevention of usurious alienation from vulnerable segments of people and ownership of house sites.\n\u201d In current times , the word \u2018 reform \u2019 is used not in its historical sense of progressive change , but to refer to all sorts of utterly regressive neoliberal policies and even outright plunder .\nSo too the phrase \u2018 land reform \u2019 has been appropriated : It now refers not to the historically progressive task of breaking up the monopoly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extractions , but policies to grab the means of production from poor peasants .\nIndeed , as Zasloff points out , the very drive for titling can become a drive for dispossession : But the implications of this process are not limited to dispossession of a section of peasants in the course of conclusive titling .\nThe fixing of conclusive titles is meant to set the stage for a wider dispossession .\nIn Part 2 of this article ( to follow ) , we discuss changes in the world economy which have fueled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of land ; and how the planned restructuring of India \u2019 s agriculture will force kisans to part with their land .\nThe theoretician of conclusive titling for Third World property The justification for the move to conclusive titling derives from a fashionable theory propounded by the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto in an international best-seller , The Mystery of Capital .\nSince its publication in 2000 , the book has become a neoliberal bible , winning praise from neoliberal icons such as Margaret Thatcher , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a host of other celebrities and authorities .\nThe institute set up and run by de Soto \u201c has been ranked as the world \u2019 s second-most influential think tank , with assignments from the ILO , the UN , and some thirty governments in the Third World and former Soviet states.\n\u201d [ 16 ] De Soto \u2019 s book is specifically aimed at refuting Marx \u2019 s thesis of irreconcilable class interests between the working people and capitalists .\nHe is worried that Marxism may still provide the only explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Marxist movements will revive : \u201c Today , there are serious statistics that provide the anticapitalists with just the ammunition they need to argue that capitalism is a transfer of property from poorer to richer countries and that Western private investment in developing nations is nothing short of a massive takeover of their resources by multinationals.\n\u201d [ 17 ] De Soto sets out to refute those who point to the misery of the Third World as an indictment of world capitalism .\nHe claims that in the West ( the advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable all persons to participate in the economy , hence capitalism is successful there ; whereas this is not the case in the Third World .\nUsing questionable methodology , he discovers that the global poor already have ample property : \u201c By our calculations , the total value of the real estate held but not legally owned by the poor of the Third World and former communist nations is at least $ 9.3 trillion.\n\u201d ( italics in the original ) [ 18 ] Of this , $ 6.7 trillion is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban dwellings \u201d ( slums and shantytowns ) , and $ 2.6 trillion is the value of \u201c informal rural area \u201d ( land holdings ) .\nBut this is what he calls \u201c dead capital \u201d , because \u201c What the poor are missing are the legally integrated property systems that can convert their work and savings into capital.\n\u201d [ 19 ] If only they had the legal titles to that property , they could borrow against it and start or expand their business activities .\nWe need not here discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogus theory , but one point is relevant for our present discussion .\nContrary to de Soto \u2019 s depiction , rural land in India is not entirely undocumented .\nMoreover , given that rural credit in India is extended by public sector banks , not private ones , decisions on how much credit to extend , and what type of collateral to accept , are determined by Government policy .\nRural landholders do possess various types of documents evidencing their right to the plots they hold .\nOn this basis , millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAccording to official press releases , 97 million farmer families have been registered on the PM-KISAN web

northeastern Japan on Saturday night , injuring around 100 people , closing roads and trains , and leaving almost a million people without electricity overnight .\nIt came almost 10 years after the nearby Tohoku quake of March 2011 , a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that caused a catastrophic tsunami and resulted in thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the hours after Saturday \u2019 s quake , there were several aftershocks up to magnitude 5 , and officials warned there could be more to come .\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake itself was an aftershock of the 2011 event .\nThat might seem odd , but aftershocks of a major earthquake can persist for years and even decades .\nHow do you know if it \u2019 s an aftershock ?\nThe earthquake occurred in what \u2019 s a called a \u201c subduction zone \u201d , where the Pacific tectonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Japan sits at a rate of 7 to 10 cm per year .\nIt \u2019 s an area where there are a lot of earthquakes .\nIt was a structurally simple earthquake : what \u2019 s called a \u201c thrust \u201d or \u201c reverse slip \u201d quake , in which rock above the fault moves up and over the rock below the fault .\nIn areas with low seismic activity , we can recognise aftershock patterns for years and decades after a major quake .\nThe Christchurch earthquake of 2016 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 quake .\nSome scientists think aftershock sequences in regions like the eastern USA and Australia may persist for centuries .\nIn these seismically quiet places , it \u2019 s relatively easier to spot aftershocks .\nThe main hallmark is that the rate of quakes in an area is higher after a major quake than it was before .\nWhen the rate of quakes has dropped back to what it was originally , we say the aftershocks have stopped .\nHowever , in places like Japan with high seismic activity , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an aftershock of another .\nOn one hand , the rates of aftershocks reduced to pre-2011 rates within about 3 years of the Tohoku earthquake and thus the sequence may have concluded .\nOn the other hand , rates of seismic activity were continuing to decrease in a fashion consistent with an ongoing aftershock sequence .\nAnd Saturday \u2019 s earthquake appears to have occurred in an area that generated fewer immediate aftershocks following the 2011 event , suggesting this earthquake could have occurred as rupture of a remaining \u201c sticky part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tohoku earthquake .\nSo was this an aftershock ?\nIt \u2019 s certainly plausible that Saturday \u2019 s quake was an aftershock .\nThe 2011 quake was enormous \u2014 the largest ever recorded in Japan , and the fourth-largest worldwide since modern record-keeping began around 1900 .\nIt released around 1,000 times as much energy as Saturday \u2019 s earthquake , and created a rupture more than 500 km long with 10s of meters of slip .\nBut the slip on the fault was not uniform and seismic activity continued in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that earthquake .\nGiven all this , it \u2019 s almost certain there will be some relationship between the two quakes .\nWhat \u2019 s more , there have been relatively few aftershocks of the 2011 quake close to where this one happened .\nThis suggests it might have been a \u201c balancing out \u201d of stresses .\nOn the other hand , there have been several magnitude 7 quakes over the past century within 100 kilometres or so of this one , so it \u2019 s hardly out of the ordinary .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aftershock or not will require detailed analysis of the quake and others in the region .\nWhat we can learn from this A quake like this one can be a valuable reminder of how important it is to learn the lessons of a disaster .\nThe earthquake generated very strong shaking in areas of Japan that were severely affected by the 2011 earthquake shaking and tsunami .\nEffects such as liquefaction are likely to have occurred again .\nPeople sometimes think a big quake relieves stress built up in Earth \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In reality , it \u2019 s the opposite .\nWhen you have a big quake , there \u2019 s a higher probability you \u2019 ll have more to come .\nSubsequent earthquakes , whether they adhere to statistical definitions of aftershocks or not , can induce recurrent hazards that cause more damage to buildings and infrastructure and present risks to human life .\nAfter a disaster , it is critical to act to reduce future exposure and vulnerability to future disasters through actions such as more considered land-use planning informed in part by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal protection through engineering of sea-walls and breakwaters and using vegetation , and making sure that warning and evacuation protocols are efficient and effective .\nJapan is a world leader

significance .\nSuch underpinnings enhance mutual confidence & ensure that peace and tranquility is sustainable .\nThe stunning disclosure recently by minister VK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Indian ingressions

online in the International Review of Law and Economics .\nThe article , \u2018 Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War \u2019 , was scheduled for inclusion in the March 2021 edition of the journal but , following expressions of concern from scholars , the article was taken down from the journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These events caused a major controversy amongst scholars .\nA copy of the article as it appeared on the journal \u2019 s website is attached ( Appendix 1 ) .\nThe main contentions of this article are : ( i ) that wartime \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 were run by private entrepreneurs , the Japanese military \u2019 s only direct role being the maintenance of hygiene in the establishments ; ( ii ) that \u2018 comfort women \u2019 freely negotiated contracts with the \u2018 comfort station \u2019 owners , reflecting their personal interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of credible commitments \u2019 ( p. 7 ) .\nThe article was strongly criticised by a number of student and other groups linked to Harvard Law School and by other groups and individuals ( see an example ) .\nOn the other hand , some groups have responded with criticisms of Ramseyer \u2019 s critics , arguing that they are threatening freedom of speech by denying Professor Ramseyer the right to controversial opinions .\nThe attached letter from a group of conservative Korean public figures , for example , has been widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US .\nIt praises Professor Ramseyer \u2019 s article , insisting that the article should be published in the journal , and argues that anyone who questions the journal \u2019 s decision to publish is trampling on free speech ( Appendix 2 ) .\nProfessor Ramseyer \u2019 s article provides a really important opportunity for a free and open debate .\nBut that debate must begin by examining the ground-rules and understandings of academic knowledge and research integrity that underpin debates between contending opinions .\nAre the participants in a debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity and ethics ?\nIf there are no ground rules , then academic journals would have no basis for rejecting any paper submitted to them , and any statement of opinion \u2013 however lacking in logic or factual evidence \u2013 would have to be treated as equal to any other .\nWe could then very easily end up spending much of the rest of our lives debating conspiracy theories or fake news which have no intellectual foundation whatever .\nTo put it at its simplest and crudest , if there are no research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all pack up and go home , because anything goes and any truth claim is just as good as any other .\nSo , I welcome the opportunity for debate , and embrace the opportunity for academics , students and the broader community to have a thorough and frank discussion about crucial questions of free speech and academic integrity .\nThis short document provides a few suggestions and questions as a starting point for such a debate , accompanied by illustrative materials from Professor Ramseyer \u2019 s article and other writings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental principles , it should be emphasised , apply not just to this article or historical issue , but across the board of research and scholarship .\nWe live in an age when the online and other media are flooded with conspiracy theories , pseudo-science , fake research findings etc .\nBut it is also an age when free speech faces as many challenges as ever , if not more .\nThe issue , then , is how we defend and uphold free speech , while also learning ( and teaching others ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHow do we distinguish well-founded research and knowledge from research that lacks integrity ?\nHow do we identify knowledge claims that lack proper foundations ?\nHow do we protect free debate while preventing the abuse of academic credentials to disseminate misleading information ?\nThese are vital problems of our age .\nUniversities have developed a range of rules and principles about proper research practices and ethics .\nThese are always a work in progress , and are an important topic for debate and improvement .\nYou can find some helpful thoughts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the US government Office of Research Integrity \u2019 s guidelines on responsible publication or the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity ( ALLEA 2017 ) .\nBelow , I suggest some key principles that , I

issues arising from research on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue and from the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation of Academies of Humanities and Sciences ( ALLEA 2017 , p. 4 ) defines the underlying principles of research integrity as being reliability , honesty , respect and accountability .\nThis means that researchers should genuinely want to find the answers to research questions , be as honest as possible about their own research motives , and be prepared to report unexpected findings if they discover that the data they are looking at contains information which they had not anticipated .\nThey should try their best ( within the human limitations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings truthfully to others , and should certainly not consciously invent or misrepresent information about the data they have collected ( e.g .\nby falsifying the results of experiments or stating that source material contains facts which it does not contain ) .\nBelow I try to flesh this out in a bit more detail .\nThe principles set out are the aims .\nNo researcher is perfect and no one piece of research fulfils all the principles listed below perfectly .\nThe issue is whether a piece of research falls so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these principles that it fails to meet fundamental standards of research integrity .\nFormer \u201c Comfort Women \u201d from various Asian countries and Holland in Tokyo in 1992.From left anonymous Taiwanese survivor , Kang Soon-ae , Wan Ai Hua , Kim Young-hil , Maria Rosa Henson , Jan Ruff O \u2019 Herne and Coordinator Indai Sajor .\n\u2022 Defining the boundaries of the research topic .\nResearch integrity begins by telling yourself and others what topic you are researching , and defining the scope of the topic .\nMany topics are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one small corner of them .\nThis can be very valuable \u2013 a single human being \u2019 s life history can tell us a lot about a whole historical era , for example .\nBut a historian who writes about a single life should try to say something to readers about the extent to which this one person \u2019 s experience can be generalised to the wider history of their day.In relation to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 What is the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue ?\nSo-called \u2018 comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese military had sex with women during the \u2018 long \u2019 Asia-Pacific War ( defined here as the period from 1931 to 1945 ) under the jurisdiction of the Japanese military authorities .\nThe Japanese government \u2019 s 1993 report \u2018 On the Issue of Wartime \u201c Comfort Women \u201d \u2019 states that \u2018 comfort stations were established in various locations in response to the request of the military authorities at the time \u2019 , and adds : \u2018 the countries or areas where it has been possible as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed are : Japan ; China ; the Philippines ; Indonesia ; the then Malaya ; Thailand ; the then Burma ; the then New Guinea ; Hong Kong ; Macao ; and the then French Indochina \u2019 .\n( In this context , \u2018 Japan \u2019 means the pre-war Japanese empire , including Okinawa , Korea , Taiwan and Karafuto [ Southern Sakhalin ] ) .\nIt defines the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 s \u2019 known places of origin as \u2018 Japan ; the Korean Peninsula ; China ; Taiwan ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nApart from Japanese , many of the comfort women transferred to the war areas were from the Korean Peninsula.\n\u2019 The report notes that the earliest \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 appear to date from 1932 , and that \u2018 many comfort stations were run by private operators , although in some areas there were cases in which the then Japanese military directly operated comfort stations.\n\u2019 ( see full document ) Substantial further research has since extended our knowledge of the problem , but this provides a starting point .\nDuring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the term \u2018 comfort station \u2019 ( ianjo ) or \u2018 comfort facility \u2019 ( ian shisetsu ) , but typically used terms such as \u2018 bar maids \u2019 ( shakufu ) or \u2018 special women \u2019 ( tokushu fujo ) to describe the women in these \u2018 facilities \u2019 .\nAllied service-people who encountered the women during the war sometimes referred to them as \u2018 comfort women \u2019 or \u2018 comfort girls \u2019 , and after the war the euphemism \u2018 comfort women \u2019 became widely used in debates .\nFrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the term \u2018 sex slaves \u2019 , drawing on the internationally understood definition of \u2018 slavery \u2019 as \u2018 an umbrella term covering practices such as forced labour , debt bondage , forced marriage , and human trafficking \u2019 and referring to \u2018 situations of exploitation that a person can not refuse or leave because of threats , violence , coercion , deception , and/or abuse of power \u2019 .\nQuestions for discussion \u2013 How well do the boundaries of the problem presented in Ramseyer \u2019 s research match the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 comfort women \u2019 problem , or the definitions used by other key reports and documents on the issue ?\nWhy does Ramseyer \u2019 s research make no mention of women from China , the Philippines , Indonesia or the Netherlands ( nor of women from Malaya , East Timor and other places who are now also known to have been recruited into the system ?\nWhy does he largely cite pre-1932 sources to analyse a post-1932 problem , and what is the basis for his claim that information about the 1920s to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asia-Pacific War ?\nGiven that the 1993 Japanese government report , like many other sources , says that the Japanese military directly operated some comfort stations , why does Professor Ramseyer state that the Japanese army \u2018 encouraged private entrepreneurs to establish semi-official brothels next to its bases \u2019 ( Ramseyer 2020 p. 1 ) but remain entirely silent about bases run by the military themselves ( including the navy ) ?\n\u2022 Defining your own position in relation to your research .\nMost researchers approach their work with some pre-existing belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives , such as the wish to influence policy , support the work of social movements etc .\nIt is important that researchers are open about their own positions .\nIt can be argued that , if a piece of research is being done specifically to advance a policy position or movement etc.\n, the author should make this clear to readers .\nIn relation to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 Immediately after publishing the article \u2018 Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War \u2019 , Professor Ramseyer went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Truth about the Comfort Women \u2019 in the online journal Japan Forward .\nHere , repeating sentences from his International Review of Law and Economics article , he shifted from his academically-worded conclusion about the application of game theory to wartime \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 to the much more aggressively political statement that \u2018 the comfort-women-sex-slave story \u2019 is \u2018 pure fiction \u2019 , that testimonies from former \u2018 comfort women \u2019 about forcible recruitment are lies , and the whole story has been driven by a left-wing South Korean lobby group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to promote a \u2018 key North Korean political goal \u2019 .\nJapan Forward is a news/opinion site established by the neo-nationalist Japanese Sankei Media group to propagate its views and those of like-minded people to an English-speaking audience ( see Nakai 2018 , p. 3 ) .\nThe site is currently running a very energetic campaign on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history , aimed at denying that any \u2018 comfort women \u2019 at all were recruited by force or deception and denouncing women who testify to forcible recruitment as liars.Questions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have provided his readers and peer reviewers with more frank information about his personal position on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue and his aims in conducting this research ?\n\u2022 Demonstrating awareness of the existing research done by others in your field \u2013 Good research needs to be based on a knowledge of the work that has been done already in the field of study .\nResearchers have very rarely read everything in their field , but they should have read a fair share of existing research , and it is helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the existing works that have informed their own research .\nWhere they strongly disagree with existing work in the field , particularly the most influential works , they should provide some explanation of the reasons why they are doing so .\nIn relation to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 Appendix 3 ( from a reading list published by the Center for Korean Legal Studies at Columbia Law School ) , contains one list of many existing works on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue in English ( representing various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists , including this one ( please note that this list is from a former \u2018 comfort women \u2019 support group , and lists works sympathetic to their cause ) ; and this one ( a somewhat older list from Japan \u2019 s Asian Women \u2019 s Fund , including key works in Japanese ) .\nYou can doubtless find more lists online.Questions for Discussion \u2013 See if you can find further lists of resources on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue .\nCan you identify the position on comfort women issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their openness to presenting conflicting positions on a subject that is notable for controversy ?\nHow many of the key existing research works on the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 issue does Professor Ramseyer refer to in his article ?\nDoes he explain his selection ?\nDoes he indicate why his work disregards the conclusions of most other researchers of the topic ?\n\u2022 Providing evidence for your research claims \u2013 The key findings of research need to be supported by verifiable evidence , which might include documents , oral testimony , material objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn relation to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 \u2018 Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War \u2019 offers an analysis of the contracts signed between \u2018 comfort women \u2019 and the owners or managers of \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 during the Asia-Pacific War .\nSurprisingly , though , Professor Ramseyer does not provide any references to or quotations from any contract actually signed by a \u2018 comfort woman \u2019 and her \u2018 employer \u2019 .\nHe provides no evidence that he has ever seen such a contract , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever signed one of these contracts or witnessed one being signed.Source material which he has read and cited ( though without acknowledging this part of its content ) describes a situation where \u2018 contracts \u2019 were signed by women who had been recruited by deception ( see 5.iii below ) , with a loan payment going to their debt-burdened families .\nRamseyer assumes that all women signed contracts on the basis of informed consent while providing no evidence to support this assumption , and remaining silent about evidence which contradicts this assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases where women clearly did not sign \u2018 contracts \u2019 of any sort ( for example , O \u2019 Herne 1998 ; McGregor and Mackie 2018 ) Question for Discussion \u2013 Does Ramseyer provide convincing evidence for the existence of \u2018 comfort women \u2019 contracts founded on \u2018 basic game theoretic principles of credible commitments \u2019 ?\nWhat percentage of the wartime \u2018 comfort women \u2019 do you think might have signed such contracts ?\n\u2022 Using sources with honesty and respect \u2013 Debates about historical , social and political issues rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents , private records , oral testimony etc .\nIt is a basic principle of research that scholars should not deliberately misrepresent the content of the sources that they cite .\nIt is also important that they think carefully about the nature of the sources and the context in which they were produced .\nIn the case both of oral and written sources , we need to ask ourselves the questions : who produced the information in this document or interview etc .\nand why ?\nUsing multiple sources carefully and honestly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 Here are just a couple of illustrative examples of the sources used by Professor Ramseyer , and of the way in which he has cited them .\n( i ) On p. 6 of the article , Professor Ramseyer quotes from the memoirs of former \u2018 comfort woman \u2019 Mun Ok-Ju , as published in the \u2018 Korea Institute of History , 2016 \u2019 .\nDespite the impressive-looking institutional title , the \u2018 Korea Institute of History \u2019 is actually an anonymous neo-nationalist online blogger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced recruitment of \u2018 comfort women \u2019 .\nThe blogprovides no information about the person who runs it or its source of funding .\nThe site does not contain Mun \u2019 s memoirs .\nRather , it contains one page of selected extracts from her memoirs , carefully chosen to try to persuade readers that her experiences were pleasurable and well-paid .\nIncidentally , it also mis-spells her name .\nUniversity of Toronto scholar Joshua Pilzer , who has studied testimony given by Mun in detail , writes that she described being forcibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of 16 and forced to provide sexual services to twenty to thirty Japanese soldiers a day ( Pilzer 2014 , p. 2 ) .\nHe quotes Mun , a courageous and resourceful woman , as saying that \u2018 on the rare occasions when we had something to laugh about in our torturous life , and when we felt lonesome or miserable , we would sing in unison or hum together quietly \u2019 ( Pilzer 2014 , p. 18 ) ( ii ) Professor Ramseyer writes that the Japanese military \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to its bases \u2019 ( Ramseyer 2020 , p.1 ) , but that \u2018 the Japanese military did not need additional prostitutes ; it had plenty .\nProstitutes have followed armies everywhere , and they followed the Japanese army in Asia \u2019 ( Ramseyer 2020 , p. 5 ) .\nThus he tells his readers that women and private brothel owners flocked to the war zones , with the role of the military in the \u2018 comfort station \u2019 system being limited to its regular checks of the hygiene of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at odds with the contents of the sources cited by Ramseyer himself , such as his reference \u2018 Naimusho 1938 \u2019 , in Suzuki et al 2006 , vol .\n1 , pp .\n124-138 ( incorrectly referenced by Ramseyer as Suzuki et al 2006 , vol .\n1 , p .\n124 . )\nThe information in that document shows that in late 1937-early 1938 private recruiters in various parts of Japan reported being urgently requested by the military command in Shanghai to help dispatch 2500-3000 Japanese women for work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) \u2019 being set up \u2018 within the Shanghai Expeditionary Army \u2019 ( Suzuki et al .\nvol .\n1 , pp .\n130 and 134 ) .\nReports of this request \u2013 and of the fact that the women were to be transported from Japan in military vessels under the supervision of Japanese military police ( kempei ) \u2013 clearly caused concern and even disbelief amongst some officials in Japan , one of whom expressed his anxiety that it was hard to maintain that this \u2018 was not in contravention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women \u2019 ( \u2018 \u5a66\u5973\u58f2\u8cb7\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u56fd\u969b\u6761\u7d04\u306e\u8da3\u65e8\u306b\u3082\u6096\u308b\u3053\u3068\u7121\u304d\u3092\u4fdd\u3057\u96e3\u304d \u2019 - Suzuki et al .\nvol .\n1 p. 125 ) .\nBut enquiries made by local authorities to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai confirmed the essence of the reports , including the central involvement of the Japanese military police and the Consulate \u2019 s own military bureau in the scheme , and the recruitment of the women continued ( Suzuki et al 2006 vol .\n1 , p. 136 ) .\nIn short , these documents provide compelling official testimony of the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in initiating and overseeing the recruitment of Japanese women to serve in \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 in China , but Ramseyer makes no mention of this aspect of the document \u2019 s content .\n( iii ) On p. 6 of his article , Ramseyer gives a detailed account of the contract terms in \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 in Malaya , and provides two sources for this information .\nOne of these is the document \u2018 US Office of War Interrogation ( 1944 ) , Interrogation Report no .\n49 \u2019 .\nYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here .\nAs was common in Allied military reports on encounters with \u2018 comfort women \u2019 on the battlefield , the tone of this report is derogatory towards the women , but the report still contains important information and is widely known to researchers .\nInterrogation Report No .\n49 does contain figures for the pay received by the women , but the figures are different from the ones cited in Ramseyer \u2019 s text , which are for Malaya , while this document is about Burma .\nSignificantly , this document does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which might seem to support the core contention of Ramseyer \u2019 s article .\nBut it states the following : \u2018 Early in May of 1942 Japanese agents arrived in Korea for the purpose of enlisting Korean girls for \u201c comfort service \u201d in newly conquered Japanese territories in Southeast Asia .\nThe nature of this \u201c service \u201d was not specified but it was assumed to be work connected with visiting the wounded in hospitals , rolling bandages , and generally making the soldiers happy .\nThe inducement used by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to pay off the family debts , easy work , and the prospect of a new life in a new land , Singapore .\nOn the basis of these false representations many girls enlisted for overseas duty and were rewarded with an advance of a few hundred yen .\nThe majority of the girls were ignorant and uneducated , although a few had been connected with \u201c oldest profession on earth \u201d before .\nThe contract they signed bound them to Army regulations and to work for the \u201c house master \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a year depending on the family debt for which they were advanced\u2026 Approximately 800 of these girls were recruited in this manner and they landed with their Japanese \u201c house master \u201d at Rangoon around August 20th , 1942 \u2019 .\nIn other words , the report shows that the signing of wartime \u2018 contracts \u2019 did not mean that these women had freely chosen to work in \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 .\n\u2018 Contracts \u2019 , in this case at least , were signed even though women were recruited by trickery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no possibility of returning until they had paid off their debt ( and in many cases probably even after paying off their debt ) .\nContrary to statements made by Ramseyer in his article ( see particularly Ramseyer 2020 , p. 5 ) , only a few had previously worked as prostitutes , while most had not .\nHaving read and cited this important document , Ramseyer fails to acknowledge or address this crucial part of its content directly at odds with his claims .\nQuestion for Discussion \u2013 See if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking friends if necessary ) can check more of the sources used in the Ramseyer article .\nConsider possible reasons why Professor Ramseyer may have failed to mention the information about contracts contained in Interrogation Report no .\n49 .\nDo you think he uses his sources in an academically responsible , honest and balanced way which genuinely conveys the content of the sources to his readers ?\n\u2022 Treating readers with honesty and respect \u2013 The Office of Integrity \u2019 s Responsible Publication guidelines , like other statements on research standards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair and accurate , so that other researchers can verify a scholar \u2019 s conclusions and follow up sources for their own further research .\nIt \u2019 s easy to make occasional mistakes with a page number or a date in a reference , but a systematic mismatch between the information in a book or article and the source material that it claims to be citing is cause for real concern.In relation to the \u2018 comfort women \u2019 history \u2013 Here are a few more instances of the sources used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he has cited them .\n( i ) One basic rule of academic referencing is that you should cite page number/s that point readers to the information you are citing .\nA large proportion of the wartime primary sources quoted by Professor Ramseyer come from a two-volume collection of archival documents edited by Suzuki Y\u016bko and others ; but in the case of these documents , Professor Ramseyer simply provides the number of the first page of the document concerned \u2013 and some of these documents run to a dozen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , the information on the page cited by Ramseyer bears no correspondence to the information he is supposed to be citing , and does not provide the necessary help to readers trying to follow up his sources .\n( ii ) He gives figures of 12 Korean \u2018 comfort women \u2019 and 527 Korean \u2018 unlicensed prostitutes \u2019 in Shanghai in 1938 , and attributes these to a document reproduced on \u2018 p .\n118 \u2019 of vol .\n1 of the Suzuki et al .\ncollection ( actually pp .\n118-120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 article by Takei Yoshikazu ( Ramseyer 2020 , p. 5 , footnote 5 ) .\nIn an earlier 2019 article , he gave the same figures and said that they were for 1940 ( Ramseyer 2019 , p. 10 ) , oddly citing pre-1940 official data as a source for 1940 statistics .\nHe seems subsequently to have spotted the problem , because his 2020 article now tells us that these are 1938 figures .\nThe figures he cites appear nowhere in either of the sources referenced .\nThe Takei document cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference presentation outline which contains no Table 6 and no figures for \u2018 comfort women \u2019 or unlicensed prostitutes .\nThere is also a full version of this paper , which does contain a Table 6 , but this table does not give numbers of individual \u2018 unlicensed prostitutes \u2019 and \u2018 comfort women \u2019 .\nThe figures are for households not individuals , and the terminology used makes it impossible to distinguish \u2018 unlicensed prostitutes \u2019 from \u2018 comfort women \u2019 .\nThe document from Suzuki et al .\ndoes not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise figure for the number of Korean unlicensed prostitutes in Shanghai ) , and gives a figure of 20 Korean \u2018 comfort women \u2019 in the \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 that it lists .\n( See Appendix 4 ) .\n( iii ) Ramseyer also writes that , in one month of 1938 , 90 Korean women \u2018 petitioned \u2019 the colonial government for permission to go to the Chinese city of Jinan \u2018 to work as unlicensed prostitutes \u2019 ( Ramseyer 2020 , p. 5 ) .\nThe document he cites as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 vol .\n1 , p. 143 ; Appendix 5 ) does not contain any mention of a petition or a request from any women , Korean or otherwise .\nWhat it contains is a letter from the colonial government of Korea reporting that 907 people ( including 115 Korean women ) had been issued with official documents for a journey to Jinan .\nThere is no mention of \u2018 unlicensed prostitutes \u2019 in the document .\nIt speaks of \u2018 special women \u2019 ( tokushu fujin ) , a term used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military \u2018 comfort women \u2019 as well as women working in private brothels .\nThe document also notes the issuing of documents to an unspecified number of others by the Japanese military police .\nIn other words , Ramseyer converts a government document about the mass transportation of women to sexual service in Jinan into a \u2018 petition \u2019 from women pleading to be \u2018 permitted \u2019 to be unlicensed prostitutes .\n( iv ) Professor Ramseyer states that \u2018 Some Korean comfort women in Burma worked on contracts as short as six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references this to a nineteen-page document in another five-volume archival collection ( Josei no tame no Ajia Heiwa Kokumin Kikin ed .\n1997 ) , The document is confusingly referenced , but the reference appears to be to p. 19 of volume 1 of this collection .\nThat page ( Appendix 6 ) contains no reference to Korean comfort women , Burma or six-months contracts .\nIt is about the setting up of \u2018 comfort stations \u2019 in North China in the 1930s .\nInterrogation Report no .\n49 , cited in 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contracts of six months to a year , but , as we have seen , states that these contracts were fraudulent .\n( v ) Professor Ramseyer \u2019 s statement that karayuki-san earned \u2018 generally higher wages [ overseas ] than they could earn within Japan \u2019 ( Ramseyer 2020 ) is referenced to \u2018 p .\n451 \u2019 of Park Yuha \u2019 s 2014 book Teikoku no Ianfu .\nSince the book only has 324 pages , it is impossible to identify the source of the information .\nQuestion for Discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with help from Japanese or Korean speaking friends if necessary ) can check more of the sources used in the Ramseyer article .\nDoes Professor Ramseyer provide full and correct references which confirm his conclusions and allow other researchers to verify them and follow up sources for their own further research ?\nHow would you rate the article \u2018 Contracting for Sex in the Pacific War \u2019 in terms of your own standards of

their pursuit of justice and campaigns for redress , toured several Chinese provinces between 2009 and 2012.1 The panels contributed to spreading awareness of wartime sexual violence and the life-long suffering endured by its victims .\nThe content of these exhibitions largely consisted of testimonies delivered by Chinese victims during a series of civil litigations instigated against the Japanese government between the 1990s and 2000s .\nThis paper examines the long-term significance of those court cases in achieving greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfort women system .\nI will argue that this significance extends well beyond the nature of the court verdicts , as exemplified by the touring exhibition of 2009-2012 , and by subsequent commemorative initiatives .\nThe issue of reparations for

thus set a kind of precedent for civil litigations elsewhere involving historical injustices against women .\nMoreover , the proceedings also carry implications for activists , scholars , and judicial personnel considering how to approach cases involving sexual violence in the courtroom while restoring respect and agency to victims .\nBoth lawyers and scholars have examined reparation cases involving Chinese former comfort women , but previous studies have tended to highlight either the jurisprudential debates or the historical facts established by the courts .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort women plaintiffs included , inter alia , statutes of limitations , claims of state immunity , and prior settlement of reparation issues in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty and subsequent bilateral treaties .\nLawyers on behalf of the victims tried to clear these jurisprudential hurdles by invoking legal norms regarding war crimes and the gross violation of human rights established in international law , but the Japanese Appellate and Supreme Courts ultimately dismissed such demands and ruled in favor of the Japanese state .\nThe court records offer a rich discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a well-organized summary of the arguments from the opposing sides .\nGoing beyond legal matters , activist Tsubokawa Hiroko and lawyer \u014cmori Noriko sought to counter the revisionist attempts to whitewash Japan \u2019 s record of wartime sexual violence by disseminating the historical facts established by courts in an easily accessible pamphlet targeting the Japanese public.4 Ikeda Eriko , too , in a more recent paper , briefly mentions the judicial recognition of sexual violence inflicted on women in Shanxi province , as well as the different forms of sex crimes perpetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court rulings do matter , since in many cases they unequivocally pronounce right or wrong and vindicate claims to victimhood ; however , an overemphasis on final judgments is problematic , since legal systems are rife with gender bias.6 As Deborah Rhode contends , many social institutions , including juridical mechanisms , are fundamentally geared towards male members of society.7 When courts adhere to the articles on reparations concluded in the San-Francisco Peace Treaty and the bilateral settlements without questioning these treaties \u2019 exclusion of women \u2019 s voices , this in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or conscious ) legal bias against women .\nIn the context of this male-oriented legal environment , we should therefore value women \u2019 s gains in securing legal acknowledgment of their initial victimization and long-term suffering , even while we also consider the significance of these judicial proceedings beyond their eventual verdicts .\nThis paper therefore challenges the conventional verdict-centered view of the civil litigations , instead highlighting how Chinese victims and their lawyers presented their cases in the courtroom .\nIt primarily scrutinizes the following two constellations of documents : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legal briefs ( junbi shomen ) , and other evidentiary materials submitted to the court by Japanese lawyers on behalf of Chinese plaintiffs ; and 2 ) lawyers \u2019 own memoirs , which shed light on the historical background of the trials .\nAlthough all four cases put Chinese victims on the witness stand , this section primarily examines the Shanxi Case , due to the availability of court transcripts.8 One may question to what extent the trial practice of the Shanxi Case represents all four cases of reparation trials initiated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not guarantee that the interaction between the victims and judicial personnel during the remaining three trials followed the same pattern , due to the absence of relevant court transcripts , it is highly likely that lawyers for these cases collaborated with one another for two reasons : 1 ) the legal briefs they prepared exhibited many similarities ; and 2 ) some of the same expert witnesses such as Ishida Yoneko and former Japanese soldiers such as Kondo Hajime were called to testify before the court.9 Court transcripts show that the lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either by calling them to testify before the court or by presenting their testimonies in the form of videotapes or signed statements .\nFeminist scholars have pointed to the importance of heeding not only the content of testimony but also the silence , reluctance , body language , and other forms of expression manifested in the process of bearing witness.10This section focuses on how the suffering endured by victims was represented and articulated before the court through an examination of court transcripts , which provide rich insights into the way in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pointed out the difficulty of bearing witness to traumatic experiences such as sexual violence .\nLegal scholar Nicola Henry , in particular , examines the constraints victims often experience in \u201c bearing witness to wartime rape \u201d in the setting of international war crimes tribunals.11 She argues that trauma and other psychological torment resulting from rape are usually deployed by the defense counsel to attack the credibility of victim testimonies or by the prosecutors to tailor the stories told by victims for prosecutorial purposes .\nHenry further points out that traumatic syndromes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against their trustworthiness , whereas lack of psychological disorders in the immediate aftermath of the sexual assault itself is deployed to deny the authenticity of the victim status.12In this sense , it is often impossible for victims of sexual violence to effectively bear witness in war crimes trials : they are often reduced to the status either of persons \u201c without [ \u2026 ] agency \u201d or of ill-intentioned liars.13 Civil settings create new possibilities , albeit not without challenges .\nAs Nikki Godden-Rasul has pointed out in a different context , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comprehending the profound impact of sexual violence upon women.14 Rather than criminal courts that center upon substantiating crimes and determining an individual defendant \u2019 s liability , civil trials place weight on financial and mental harm imposed upon victims and account for the diversity of afflictions resulting from sexual violence.15Judith Herman , on the other hand , contends that victims of sexual and domestic violence are generally unsatisfied with either civil or criminal legal proceedings , the adversarial format of which tends to marginalize victims and overlook their pain.16 Therefore , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel interact with victims generally affects their satisfaction with the judicial process .\nThe reparation trials involving Chinese comfort women granted victims a chance to develop their own narratives in a public legal forum .\nAs I discuss further below , trauma remains raw and deep-seated social mechanisms that perpetuated violence against women as well as individual women \u2019 s agony and hardship found expression in the court proceedings .\nKang Jian , a Chinese lawyer who engaged in evidence collection and attended some of the court hearings , recalls that lawyers acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarized their jurisprudential opinion in the legal briefs , without really voicing their opinions regarding the reliability and credibility of testimonies delivered by victims before the court.17This observation is corroborated by the court transcripts of victim testimonies , where the process of cross-examination is almost entirely absent .\nWhatever the reason for the defending lawyers \u2019 reluctance to cross-examine the former Chinese comfort women , their silence in court nevertheless meant that victims \u2019 narratives were not truncated , nor was the truthfulness of their testimonies challenged over inconsistencies and lapses in memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims \u2019 credibility , in part because their lawyers substantiated their oral testimony with corroborating evidence .\nChinese and Malayan girls forcibly taken from Penang by the Japanese to work as \u2018 comfort girls \u2019 for the troops ( Public Domain ) In contrast to international war crimes proceedings that focus on defendants and sex crimes per se,18 the reparation trials gave agency to victims and stressed the far-reaching harm brought about by sexual violence .\nThe testimony they offered invariably featured description of both sex crimes and the suffering that these women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the witnesses were requested by their lawyers to state their demands of the Japanese government , and their answers provide insight into their motivation in bearing witness .\nMy examination of these testimonies draws on performance scholar Elizabeth W. Son \u2019 s analysis of the Women \u2019 s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan \u2019 s Military Sexual Slavery ( Women \u2019 s Tribunal ) and literary scholar Shoshana Felman \u2019 s analysis of the legal proceedings of the Eichmann Trial in 1961 .\nSon examines the performance of testimonies and scars at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people \u2019 s court organized by grassroots activists and convened in Tokyo in 2000 , arguing that the Tribunal functioned as \u201c a site of knowledge production and community formation.\n\u201d 19 Through a detailed account of witnesses \u2019 gestures , Son points to the tension between : 1 ) legal protocols of oath-taking and victim-survivors \u2019 desire to bear witness in their own ways ; 2 ) the prosecution counsel \u2019 s focus on criminal behavior and victim-survivors \u2019 need to circumvent details of violation against their bodies and to exert ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juridical emphasis on vocal testimony and the impossibility of articulating trauma\u2014as well as victim-survivors \u2019 body gestures as expressions of pain .\nSon contends that the proceedings of the Women \u2019 s Tribunal ushered in \u201c [ a ] process-oriented conception of justice.\n\u201d 20 Borrowing Son \u2019 s proceedings-focused analytical framework , in this section I delve into the way judicial personnel interacted with victims as well as victims \u2019 own representations of their suffering .\nMy analysis of the testimony is also inspired by Felman \u2019 s analysis of the Eichmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative , but jurisprudentially revolutionary.\n\u201d 21 It was \u201c historiographically conservative \u201d in the sense that the trial situated itself within the historical context of discrimination against and persecution of Jews , stopping short of stressing the unprecedented scale of atrocities inflicted upon Jews during the Nazi genocide.22 On the other hand , Felman also points out that by centering on the victims and their voices , the Eichmann Trial was \u201c jurisprudentially revolutionary , \u201d since it produced a history of the Holocaust based on victims \u2019 testimonies before the court.23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunal rather than a civil case , the significant common ground between the two proceedings makes the borrowing of Felman \u2019 s framework a rational choice here .\nFirstly , both cases \u201c put history on trial \u201d .24 The Eichmann Trial not only adjudicated the defendant \u2019 s individual liability but also deliberated on the historical oppression of Jews.25 In the different legal and social context of the Asia-Pacific region , victims and their lawyers in the reparation trials focused on the responsibility of the Japanese government for the systematic enslavement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court proceedings also heard lawyers \u2019 presentations of the pertinent historical background .\nSecondly , both proceedings gave victims a voice .\nFelman \u2019 s research highlights that unlike previous criminal proceedings that focused on convicting defendants , the Eichmann trial focused on victims , enabling them to articulate their agonizing experiences and to form a collective \u201c political and moral identity.\n\u201d 26 In the same vein , the comfort women trials also foregrounded the testimonies delivered by victims and acknowledged their continued suffering .\nOwing to these similarities , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights .\nFelman points out that unlike the legal verdicts of the Eichmann Trial that \u201c distance \u201d history , the victims \u2019 testimonies brought historical events into the courtroom.27 Similarly , by calling victims to testify before the court , the court hearings of the comfort women trials also functioned to \u201c transmit \u201d \u2014to borrow Felman \u2019 s words again\u2014historical events into the present through the medium of narratives and the presence of witnesses.28 The following examination of the testimonies is based on this idea of \u201c transmission.\n\u201d 29 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories : 1 ) the communication of knowledge through clear , verbal articulation ; and 2 ) the attempted expression of the incomprehensible through unconscious physical exhibition and presence , as well as the less articulate use of language .\nThe first aspect concerns the lawyers \u2019 representation and victims \u2019 ( as well as their daughters \u2019 ) testimonies with regard to the complex pain and intergenerational trauma caused by the comfort women system .\nThe testimony offered by victims on their pre-war plight and wartime victimization was generally quite clear .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to some of the less readily comprehensible aspects of the physical and narrative representations of sex crimes and the demands aimed at the Japanese government , which will be examined from the second perspective .\nIn the Shanxi Case , the longest victim testimony was delivered by Wan Aihua , who was forced into sexual slavery three separate times between 1942 and 1943 .\nShe also endured torture under captivity due to her political affiliation .\nIn her testimony , responding to Kawaguchi Kazuko , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , Wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her arrest and confinement by the Japanese military , her experience of sexual assault and torture , her escape and survival , and her subsequent ostracization by her family , among other aspects of her life .\nWan \u2019 s narrative was especially detailed , possibly for two reasons .\nFirst , she was coerced into sexual enslavement three times .\nSecond , she had prior experience of giving testimony in public .\nDue to the level of detail of the court record relating to Wan \u2019 s experience and the commonality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other witnesses , the following analysis focuses primarily on Wan \u2019 s testimony .\nAs the victims gave testimony to their suffering in the form of answers to lawyers \u2019 questions , we should be aware that these questions to a certain extent determined which parts of the victims \u2019 stories were heard in court and which were omitted .\nTransmission of Conscious Knowledge : Intersectionality of Pain and intergenerational Trauma The questions and answers exhibited in the court transcripts demonstrate the lawyers \u2019 attempt to have the \u201c intersectionality \u201d of victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coined by feminist scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in her analysis of black women \u2019 s plight , the term intersectionality has been employed to mean that gender discrimination , racial injustice , and class exploitation , among other forms of contextual and structural inequalities , intertwine to cause women \u2019 s oppression.30 Although the lawyers did not reference the term directly in their legal briefs , the way they solicited testimonies illustrates their desire to add nuance to judicial understanding of the suffering of comfort women .\nIn the case of Wan Aihua , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her victimization from sexual violence , Kawaguchi Kazuko solicited testimony concerning her life prior to the Sino-Japanese War .\nIn her response to these questions , Wan revealed her experience of being sold as a child bride due to abject poverty and being forced into sexual intercourse with her future husband .\nLater in her testimony , after recalling her first escape from the cave where she was kept in captivity for interrogation and sexual abuse , Wan mentioned that she was no longer welcomed back by the family into which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative that unfolds in Wan \u2019 s story therefore points to the multivalence of her life-long hardship and sexual abuse .\nPrior to the War of Resistance , she was sold as an object by her parents .\nWhen she was seen as having lost her \u201c chastity \u201d to foreign abusers , she was devalued in terms of the patriarchal norms of Chinese society , and cast aside by her first husband .\nPatriarchal culture and Japanese sex crimes , however , were not the only elements put forward as causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yulin , another victim of the comfort women system , testified that she had also been abused\u2014though not sexually\u2014by a Chinese collaborator.32 Through these testimonies , Chinese complicity in the operation of the comfort women system also came to light .\nIn fact , historians such as Ishida Yoneko have made clear in their research based on interviews with comfort women victims in Shanxi Province that the villages , as patriarchal entities , were complicit in sustaining the comfort women system .\nIshida and others point out that heads of villages proffered women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter \u2019 s demands and selected as comfort women those eking out a living on the margins of society.33 In this sense , various factors intersected in subjecting comfort women to military sexual violence and social prejudice .\nThey include : 1 ) Japanese sex crimes inflicted directly upon their bodies ; 2 ) patriarchy manifested in the decision of village heads to sacrifice some marginalized women for the preservation of the village as a whole ; 3 ) poverty that shunted some women to the margins of local community ; 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of so-called chastity ; and 5 ) local collaboration that further exacerbated women \u2019 s pain .\nAlbeit in a different context , anthropologist Sarah Soh argues in the same light that imperialism , colonialism , racism , sexism , patriarchy , economic hardship , and the issue of Korean complicity all interacted and overlapped , contributing to these women \u2019 s plight both prior to their sexual abuse and subsequently.34 By unveiling the manifold acts of violence and discrimination against Chinese victims , lawyers sought not only to add weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Japan \u2019 s occupation and the harm incurred due to military sexual violence in patriarchal societies , but also to facilitate a comprehensive juridical understanding of victims \u2019 physical and psychological pain .\nThis multivalent victimization was not frozen in the timeframe of the war , but continued to haunt victims and their family members , as much of the testimony emphasized .\nIn addition to former comfort women themselves , the lawyers also called on daughters or foster-daughters of victims , expert witnesses , and male villagers who had experienced Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sex crimes and their long-term impact .\nDaughters were typically called to give testimony on behalf of their deceased mothers ; Zhang Fenxiang , a daughter of former comfort woman Hou Qiaolian , was called to bear witness to her mother \u2019 s post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) resulting from the latter \u2019 s sexual enslavement .\nShe related the sudden flashbacks her mother experienced while watching movies featuring war and her other daily difficulties resulting from PTSD .\nIt is noteworthy that Zhang also described scenes in which her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted her violent behavior after regaining her composure .\nEngulfed by this threat of violence during childhood , Zhang herself had developed various psychological conditions as a result and relied on sedative drugs and painkillers for headaches.35 Zhang \u2019 s story showcases the intergenerational suffering brought about by the comfort women system .\nThe trauma became \u201c contagious \u201d as it was transmitted to immediate family members , exposing them to violence from the traumatized original victims.36 Zhang \u2019 s testimony highlighted the phenomenon of PTSD and its profound impact on former comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this sense , for comfort women victims and their families , as Kathleen Daly has pointed out in a different context , \u201c victimization is a process.\n\u201d 37 It does not wane with the passage of time ; rather , it ruthlessly defies both victims \u2019 humanity and their familial bonds over time .\nAt the end of Zhang \u2019 s testimony , she also claimed that although her mother had died , she was determined to carry on the struggle for justice on her behalf .\nThe children of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise from their mothers.38 The episode suggested to the court that intergenerational suffering had transformed into intergenerational determination for the pursuit of justice.39 These testimonies on the intersectionality of pain and intergenerational suffering therefore broadened the meaning of the courtroom by turning it into a space where witnesses and lawyers collaborated to explain the extent of the suffering experienced and seek recognition for the victims .\nBut in addition to such efforts to articulate and explain pain , the court also witnessed the presentation of somewhat muddled narratives , some of which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nTransmission of the Unconscious and Incomprehensible : Verbal Articulation , Physical Exhibition , and Presence Aside from descriptions of multilayered violence , the representation of sex crimes also deserves attention .\nIt demonstrated to the court not only the difficulties of narrating the details of sexual violence but also the importance of respecting victims \u2019 own representation of the crimes .\nWhen asking questions related to sex crimes , instead of using explicit words such as rape or sexual slavery , Kawaguchi employed the phrase \u201c victimization of women ( josei toshite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shying away from direct articulation of rape , Wan responded that she was abused and raped by Japanese soldiers when under captivity .\nRegardless of Wan \u2019 s use of the term \u201c rape , \u201d she never explained in detail how exactly she was sexually abused , in stark contrast to her detailed answers describing other forms of torture inflicted upon her by the Japanese soldiers .\nKawaguchi did not ask follow up questions on Wan \u2019 s sexual abuse , unlike prosecutors in criminal trials who tend to insist on soliciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly reflects the lawyer \u2019 s understanding of many women \u2019 s desire to circumvent detailed description of sex crimes and even the term rape itself .\nOther lawyers on behalf of plaintiffs did directly employ the word rape , but none of them pushed victims for detailed descriptions of the violation of their sexual and physical integrity .\nWan also had reason to describe her torture in great detail , since she attributed her smaller stature to the bone fractures that resulted from torture .\nWhatever the exact reasons for the lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 attempts to circumvent details of rape , the fact that the lawyers refrained from pressing for graphic descriptions of forcible penetration restored to comfort women victims a sense of control and authority over their own narratives .\nComfort women caught and interrogated by the US army in Myitkyina ( August 14 , 1944 ) ( Public Domain ) Besides verbal expressions , Wan also used her body to communicate particular points .\nShe sought to express pain and trauma through her physical gestures .\nThe gestures she made to illustrate how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s questions , for example , \u201c Does this posture mean that you were suspended from the tree , rather than tied to it ?\n\u201d This physical gesturing demonstrated Wan \u2019 s fervent desire to convey exactly how she was tortured .\nShe tried to bring attention back to her body in her final remarks to the court when talking about Japanese atrocities in China , saying , \u201c please take a look at my body .\nI do not have pubic hair [ as a result of Japanese sexual torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already dispossessed of a female body.\n\u201d 42 For Wan , it seemed , certain body features , such as pubic hair , were closely associated with the essence of feminine physical attributes , the loss and deformation of which deprived her of the very sense of being a woman .\nFurthermore , the directing of attention to her body exemplified Wan \u2019 s wish to emphasize the life-long consequences of the physical violence she suffered .\nBy reenacting the scene of torture and by calling attention to her own injured body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of the violence inflicted upon her and enabled the audience to experience her physical pain vicariously .\nAlthough direction of audience attention to violated bodies is not evident in the court transcripts of other victims in the Shanxi Case , the physical presence of the victims speaks to the court of the pain inflicted and the long-term consequence of the sex crimes.43 This exhibition constitutes what Felman calls the \u201c physical legal dimension \u201d of the court , in which the injured bodies before the court carried \u201c jurisprudential speaking power.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women system \u201c returned as a ghost or as an incarnated , living present \u201d in the very bodies of the victims.45 In a different but relevant context , Elizabeth Son examines victims \u2019 physical representation of their suffering before the Women \u2019 s Tribunal , arguing that oral testimony alone falls short of comprehensively representing the \u201c physical imprint of the trauma on her body.\n\u201d 46Borrowing Son \u2019 s words and insights on the analysis of the victims and their physical presentation of wounds before the Women \u2019 s Tribunal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was tortured together with her shortened body stature , Wan , as well as other comfort women victims , also \u201c assigned her body new meanings and repositioned herself as a survivor \u201d during the reparation lawsuits.47 In this sense , they transmitted their experience of pain to the court through their physical exhibition and presence .\nWan \u2019 s burning desire to represent herself was also manifested in a number of verbal outbursts .\nOn several occasions , she disrupted court proceedings and demanded an apology and fair judgment .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kawaguchi who inquired how Wan fled the comfort station for the second time and whether either of her families came to her rescue .\nShe answered that she somehow escaped by herself ; unlike other victims , she had no one to rely on .\nThen , in the following sentences , she suddenly turned to address the judges directly : I want to reveal the sufferings inflicted upon me .\nI also wish to obtain an [ official ] acknowledgment of the crimes committed by the Japanese military .\nI sincerely hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just me but also other grandmothers who endured these crimes .\nMy whole family would sincerely appreciate a ruling in our favor.48 Wan \u2019 s words demonstrate her desire for the court to uphold justice both for herself and for other victims .\nKawaguchi waited until Wan finished and then brought the conversation back to her inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Wan \u2019 s return to her village .\nIn answer to Kawaguchi \u2019 s question regarding the murder of the village head at the hands of the Japanese military , Wan commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese soldiers perpetrated wanton killing and torture in China .\nOnce again , she went beyond the line of questioning : I no longer have a human shape ; therefore , I am not filing this lawsuit for myself , but for many other victims : victims of rape , deceased victims\u2026 I wanted to settle these old scores ( urami o harashitai ) .\nAlthough more than five decades have passed since the incidents , I have been living with anger and resentment since then .\nI feel lucky that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] good judges .\nI could not be happier if these scores were to be settled .\nI would be really grateful if these old debts could be paid.49 We see Wan reiterate her desire to gain justice for all victims of war crimes .\nAlso notable in this short plea is Wan \u2019 s repeated use of the phrase \u201c settling old scores ( urami o harasu ) , \u201d which demonstrates the extent to which she was burdened with the unresolved feelings of exasperation and injustice .\nAfter Wan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony of the sex crimes and asked Wan about her physical condition after the withdrawal of the Japanese military .\nWan first responded to Kawaguchi about her poor heath and then for a third time , she made a direct request to the court .\nShe restated her desire for justice and for a settling of old scores .\nIn the ensuing exchange , in an attempt to present to the court the difficulty in bearing witness , Kawaguchi asked Wan about her previous experience of delivering testimony .\nInstead of answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fourth time , disrupted the legal proceedings , remarking that although some of her memory might be fuzzy , she was telling the truth out of her sense of conscience .\nShe continued , saying she trusted that the judges would uphold justice and called for a just court ruling .\nIn her final remarks , once again , she expressed her wish to \u201c settle old scores \u201d and highlighted her need and that of other victims for recognition , apology , and justice .\nShe also stressed that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak about her suffering or to initiate litigations , if she had not been able to meet with Japanese judges.50 The verbal reiterations and disruptions cogently transmitted to the court the victim \u2019 s motivation to bear witness through linguistic repetitions .\nWan \u2019 s repeated statement that she was testifying not only for herself but also on behalf of other victims displays her sense of moral obligation to others .\nAs some scholars have pointed out in a different context , \u201c fulfilling a moral duty \u201d \u2014to reveal atrocities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay homage to the wronged\u2014is an important factor in motivating people to bear witness to mass atrocities.51 Wan \u2019 s motivation to perform this moral obligation can be corroborated by Kawaguchi \u2019 s statement tendered to the court .\nKawaguchi mentioned that during a rehearsal session in preparation for the court hearing , Wan lost her temper , asking , \u201c how many times do you have to ask the same question ?\nIs it not true that I have already answered that question ?\n\u201d 52 Kawaguchi speculates that Wan considered herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regarded bearing testimony as her \u201c duty ( Jpn .\nshimei ; Chn .\nrenwu ) ; \u201d otherwise , she might have avoided speaking about these experiences.53 On the other hand , Stepakoff et al .\nhold that people articulate traumatic experiences to obtain recognition of the crimes committed against them and the long-term pain they experience in order to ameliorate their psychological suffering.54 Indeed , regardless of individual differences in the details of victimization and family background , many victims expressed similar desires .\nThey mentioned their wishes to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle old scores , obtain official acknowledgment , secure an apology and reparations , have their reputations restored , and resolve the comfort women issue before their deaths.55 In the case of Wan , apart from her strong sense of responsibility , her repeated use of the term \u201c settling old scores \u201d indicates her pent-up indignation towards individual perpetrators and the Japanese government .\nDuring the court proceedings , although Kawaguchi always directed the testimony back to her questions , neither the lawyers nor judges disrupted Wan \u2019 s narrative or dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lawyers turned the courtroom into a relatively safe space , where victims transmitted their knowledge and experience to the court while attempting to exert control over their stories .\nThrough the process of delivering testimony , lawyers and victims together transcended the meaning of the courtroom and carved out a space in which victims ( and at times their close family members ) could attempt to explain to the court the intersectionality of suffering and intergenerational pain brought about by the comfort women system .\nAs a group of victims who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their agency in memory , what they demanded first and foremost was recognition .\nThis was also demonstrated in the legal briefs the lawyers submitted to the court on behalf of victims .\nSince many legal briefs submitted during the court proceedings focus on jurisprudential issues such as statutes of limitations and state immunity , this section primarily examines the final legal briefs ( saish\u016b junbi shomen ) tendered to the court at the last phase of each case , except for the First Case , the court records of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the actual layout , these final legal briefs were usually composed of the following sections : 1 ) the historical background of Japan \u2019 s war with China as well as the comfort women system based on academic works ; 2 ) victims \u2019 wartime and postwar suffering collected from testimonies and supplemented by scholarly papers ; and 3 ) jurisprudential debates .\nThe bulk of most final legal briefs was devoted to legal claims , but much ink is also spilled on historical background and women \u2019 s physical and psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the comfort women reparation trials involving Chinese victims stressed the importance of courts \u2019 recognition of both historical facts and victims \u2019 suffering .\nThis specific emphasis resonates with lawyer \u014cmori Noriko \u2019 s comment in her memoir on the court ruling on the First Case .\nAlthough realizing how difficult it would be to win the case , the lawyers endeavored to at least have the court vindicate the testimony of the comfort women victims.56 To their disappointment , however , the Tokyo District Court not only adjudicated in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acknowledge the sexual violence inflicted upon victims.57 Probably in an attempt to prevent a repetition of what they considered legal negligence , in their final legal brief for the Second Case , lawyers vehemently denounced the \u201c abnormality ( ij\u014dsei ) \u201d of the judgment rendered by the Tokyo District Court in the First Case.58 They pointed out that the court \u2019 s failure to acknowledge the victims \u2019 pain and its relationship with Japan \u2019 s war of aggression revealed its \u201c stance of sheer collaboration ( zenmen teki na ky\u014dryoku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose legal representatives always skirted historical points raised by the claimants , instead focusing entirely on jurisprudential issues.59 The lawyers for the victims therefore strongly urged the court to act in its own right , rather than out of political considerations.60 They also requested that the court contextualize the sex crimes perpetrated under the auspices of the comfort women system.61 Only by situating the sexual violence imposed upon victims in the larger social context of the war , they explained , would it be possible to comprehensively fathom the affected women \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts surrounding the war and comfort women system itself was still insufficient , the lawyers argued , since the judges also needed to acknowledge victims \u2019 suffering .\nIn particular , the lawyers for the victims in the Hainan Case viewed acknowledgment of the facts surrounding their clients \u2019 victimhood as the fundamental responsibility of the judges and called on them to \u201c face up to the facts ( jijitsu o chokushi-suru ) \u201d based on the evidence submitted in court.63 They further argued that one of the most important reasons why victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the court to validate their claims to victimhood.64 How did the lawyers strive to achieve this goal of legal recognition ?\nTo begin with , they attempted to arouse the empathy of the judges by appealing to their humanity and by connecting the wartime sexual slavery system to contemporary sex crimes .\nDuring the Hainan Case , the lawyers associated legal recognition of historical facts and suffering pertaining to the comfort women system with the judges \u2019 \u201c sensitivity as human beings ( hito toshite no kansei ) .\n\u201d 65 Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women issue in the context of international and domestic violations of women \u2019 s human rights .\nFor example , the lawyers for the Second Case pointed out that contemporary armed conflicts such as those in Rwanda and Yugoslavia also witnessed large-scale sexual violence against women .\nTo eradicate sex crimes as such , they claimed , it was indispensable for the aggressors to offer official apologies and reparations , and to punish perpetrators.66 Turning attention closer to home , the lawyers in this same legal brief reminded the court of the rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a twelve-year-old schoolgirl was raped by three U.S. soldiers , and the fury this sparked among the Japanese populace.67 To stimulate the judges \u2019 empathy , the lawyers asked them to imagine how they might feel should such sexual violence be perpetrated against \u201c our own daughters ( wareware no musume ) .\n\u201d 68 The lawyers \u2019 intention to induce empathy in the judges is evident from the account in lawyer \u014cmori Noriko \u2019 s memoir .\n\u014cmori reveals that the lawyers deemed it their duty to \u201c soften the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judges and to stimulate their imaginations.69 In fact , this also explains why the lawyers went to such great lengths to bring Chinese comfort women victims to Japan to bear witness.70With written documents alone , they assumed , it might be difficult for judges to understand properly the agony that victims endured , since the plaintiffs were non-Japanese and the crimes took place decades ago.71 Both the testimonies and the legal briefs were thus designed to arouse empathetic feelings among the judicial personnel ( as well as all those present at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of what the comfort women victims endured .\nWhy did recognition matter , particularly for Chinese comfort women ?\nChinese victims had been excised from historical accounts and collective memory for too long , and it was thus necessary to carve out a space for recognition by producing an authentic record of both women \u2019 s direct suffering under the comfort women system and their hardship over the following decades .\nThe \u201c heroic narratives \u201d formed in the aftermath of the war feature grandiose and mythic stories of suffering , sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for alternative wartime experiences.72 Meanwhile , given the limits on articulation imposed by the post-war social and cultural milieu\u2014what historian Carol Gluck calls the \u201c effability factor \u201d \u2014many victim-survivors of sexual violence chose to remain silent about the crimes inflicted upon them.73 In fact , as Ishida has pointed out , regardless of the dearth of records on the experiences of victims of sex crimes as a whole , those who were raped to death or rape-murdered fared slightly better in the official historical documents than victim-survivors.74 The former very occasionally figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter almost always appear in abstract , vague numbers , such as \u201c countless.\n\u201d 75 Historian Louise Edwards argues that the discrimination against victim-survivors of sexual violence has some bearing on the lien\u00fc , or \u201c chaste female martyrs \u201d phenomenon , under which women were expected to prioritize chastity over everything else , including their lives.76 In her study of anti-Japanese propaganda cartoons produced during wartime China , Edwards points out that the fate that befell rape victims in wartime propaganda was almost always death , with the reproductive system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated by weapons after rape , so that the values of so-called chastity could be upheld and the apprehension of pregnancy resulting from rape could be erased.77 Victim-survivors of sexual violence , in this sense , were considered not only to be tarnished women due to their loss of chastity but also to bring shame to their families and villages , embodying men \u2019 s failure to guarantee the safety of \u201c their \u201d women.78 Therefore , the comfort women victims , who survived the ordeal in Japanese military comfort stations , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both their forced sexual intercourse with Japanese soldiers and their survival .\nThis also in part explains the reason why the comfort women system was largely disregarded in the postwar Class B/C war crimes trials carried out by Nationalist and Communist Chinese , among other authorities.79 As a disgrace to their villages , their suffering was erased from local history , not to mention national historical narratives .\nTogether with a place in history , they were denied agency in memory as well .\nAlthough the history of Chinese comfort women has entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been entangled with nationalistic rhetoric .\nHistorian Song Shaopeng , for example , argues that the media has framed the comfort women issue within a nationalistic framework.80 She notes that in the early 1990s , when the comfort women issue first surfaced , it was represented as a diplomatic dispute between Japan and its neighboring countries , South Korea in particular ; as a result , the lawsuits instigated by the Chinese victims during this period did not attract much media attention .\nLater , with the transformation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue came to be portrayed as a symbol of national suffering , and the Hainan Case later in the 2000s received limited coverage in the media.81 She further maintains that rather than dissecting the multivalent violence inflicted upon the victims , the Chinese media has continued to appropriate their stories for the purpose of adding more weight to the collective suffering of the Chinese at the hands of the Japanese during the War of Resistance.82 Resonating with Song \u2019 s argument , Edward Vickers maintains that the representation of comfort women in official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims , without attention to Chinese complicity in women \u2019 s suffering or the larger social context of sex trafficking.83 Although the comfort women lost their lawsuits , nevertheless , together with their lawyers , they carved out an official , legal discursive space for a comprehensive representation of their suffering.84 The court verdicts on all cases involving Chinese comfort women , except for the First Case at the Tokyo District Court , recognized as facts the sex crimes and torture inflicted upon victims , as well as their subsequent life-long physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the courts ultimately denied victims \u2019 requests for an apology and reparations , this recognition itself held considerable significance .\nIn a different context , Clare McGlynn and Nicole Westmarland point out that victim-survivors of sexual violence consider \u201c recognition as justice.\n\u201d 85 In the case of comfort women , for those who fell victim to Japanese sexual violence and social ostracization , among other forms of multilayered violence , recognition of Japanese military sexual slavery and vindication of their claims to victimhood matter tremendously .\nOfficial acknowledgment sends out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole that rather than shameful women to be disdained , comfort women are wronged victims who deserve respect and recognition at the very least .\nFrom a broader social perspective , as Judith Butler has argued , recognition is indispensable for all individual human beings.86 She further maintains that the act of granting and seeking recognition transforms who people are , since the interaction involved in this process places them in a living relationship with one another.87 The lawsuits instigated by comfort women with the help of Japanese lawyers , while failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicalities ( i.e .\ninternational treaties and statutes of limitations ) , nonetheless succeeded in so far as they secured legal recognition positioning the state as wrongdoer in relation to victims .\nBeyond the courtroom , the knowledge of victims \u2019 suffering also transmitted to a larger audience .\nThe touring exhibitions mentioned at the outset of this paper reached approximately 180,000 visitors in total.88While it is impossible to gauge the overall impact of the exhibits on attendees , the research conducted by Chinese scholar Qu Yajun provides a glimpse into the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messages left at the exhibition site of Shaanxi Normal University , Qu points out that the responses\u2014mostly from students\u2014featured three themes : 1 ) the importance of peace , as women almost always fall victim to wartime sexual violence ; 2 ) a profound understanding of victims \u2019 suffering , as a result of both wartime sexual enslavement and postwar social prejudice and ostracization ; and 3 ) self-reflexivity on the rise of Chinese nationalism , upon realizing Japanese activists \u2019 and scholars \u2019 unflagging commitment to the resolution of the comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese victims \u2019 testimonies and pursuit of justice in the reparation litigations also in part formed a special exhibition temporarily housed at the Women \u2019 s Active Museum on War and Peace ( WAM ) in Tokyo between 2008 and 2009 .\nIn this sense , the transmission of knowledge regarding victims \u2019 suffering and their yearning for justice transcends the physical space of the courtroom , reaching a wider audience and exerting a long-lasting influence on the commemoration of comfort women .\nThrough a close reading of the court records , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of which have been understudied thus far , this paper shows how the comfort women victims and their lawyers broadened the meaning of the reparation trials by turning the courtroom into a space for transmitting knowledge and gaining recognition .\nAlthough their efforts were frustrated in the sense that the Japanese courts never ruled in favor of the Chinese plaintiffs , the trials nevertheless bore witness to the victims \u2019 pursuit of justice .\nThe court transcripts demonstrate that the victims obtained the opportunity to transmit their experience to the judicial personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their formal testimony as well as through physical display , without being interrupted or denied by defense lawyers or by other judicial personnel .\nMoreover , though aware of the difficulties involved in winning the cases , the lawyers spared no effort in seeking the courts \u2019 recognition of the brutality of the comfort women system and the women \u2019 s victimhood.91 This paper therefore also demonstrates that for a better understanding of civil trials involving sexual violence and historical injustice , it is essential to go beyond an examination of final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials also carry implications for other civil litigations elsewhere adjudicating sexual violence , in a world fraught with sexual and gender-based historical injustice and ongoing sexual violence in armed conflict .\nThese trials were nonetheless far from unproblematic .\nIn her research on human responses to large-scale atrocities , Martha Minow surveys a range of trials , truth commissions , reparations , and apologies , and argues that none of these are sufficient to cure the wounds and to mend the wrongs suffered.92 This argument rings true for these reparation trials , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of victims with similar experiences .\nIn fact , victims featured in all four lawsuits came from just two major provinces\u2014Shanxi and Hainan\u2014and were selected by lawyers on the grounds that their narratives were independently verifiable.93 Those ( far more numerous ) who had endured in isolation or silence had no opportunity to enjoy their day in court .\nThis selectivity has some relevance to the legal structure of the trials , since unverifiable claims do not constitute admissible evidence .\nAs lawyer Barbara Freg has pointed out in an interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c for a certain type of justice for certain selected victims.\n\u201d 94 Therefore , to uphold justice for all comfort women victims , it is also vital to direct attention to those whose stories are excluded from the lawsuits .\nRegardless , the reparation trials still carry tremendous significance for the victims and their families , for future litigations , and as a form of public history\u2014as demonstrated by the use made of the testimony in subsequent public exhibitions .\nThey exemplify a defiance of persistent taboos surrounding the verbal articulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons for future responses to such atrocities .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site ,

Studies , warned that the United States may confront a military crisis arising from North Korea \u2019 s regime instability or its collapse .\nHe argued that the North Korean economy could not survive \u201c for another year or longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockades for quarantine measures , and thus the North Korean government may be tempted to take military actions against external enemies , or it may lose control of its nuclear weapons .\nCha is one of the most influential North Korea analysts in Washington ; unfortunately , in this case , his argument is closer to fiction than reality .\nThe inaccuracies and distorted description of North Korea \u2019 s situation themselves create risks .\nSuch a view not only makes it more difficult to solve the North Korean nuclear problem , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as a military option .\nIn this article , we rebut Cha \u2019 s claim in hopes of providing a more accurate basis for considering diplomatic and policy options .\nFirst , there is almost no possibility that the North Korean economy will collapse .\nCha argues that the recent North Korean economy is in a situation \u201c comparable to the Great Famine in the 1990s.\n\u201d However , the reality is entirely different from his assertion .\nNorth Korea experienced a terrible crisis in the years after the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two million people starved to death despite foreign aid .\nThere were no strong sanctions and a border blockade at that time , but there was mass starvation .\nOn the contrary , recently , starvation is not pervasive in North Korea even with tough economic sanctions and border blockades as far as we know .\nWhy does this difference exist ?\nThe reason is that North Korea has already developed internal conditions for survival with which it can manage to muddle through strong sanctions .\nSince the early 2010s , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reform and openness to strengthen its survival capacity and resilience .\nIn 2018 , its national strategy shifted from a military-first approach to an economy-first one .\nNew economic changes in North Korea encompass a wide range of areas such as facilitating import substitution and domestic production , adopting competitive systems , expanding markets , reforming financial institutions , establishing commercial banks , and promoting science and technology .\nHowever , the opening-up policy has been postponed because of strong economic sanctions caused by North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c socialist corporate responsible management system \u201d and \u201c field responsibility system \u201d has increased production and facilitated distribution in light industry and agriculture .\nThe former grants firms substantive management rights to run business autonomously , and the latter permits individual farmers to be rewarded for their crop yields .\nAs a result of an import substitution policy , the proportion of domestically manufactured products has rapidly increased in markets .\nAlso , exchange rates and market prices for items such as rice and gasoline have become relatively stable .\nNorth Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to have at least three modest meals a day .\nComparing the current North Korean economy to the Arduous March in the mid-to-late-1990s is a deeply flawed approach that considers only the magnitude of challenges facing North Korea , ignoring its enhanced ability to cope with them .\nOf course , the decline in trade and investment due to sanctions and border blockades poses a major obstacle to North Korea \u2019 s economic development .\nHowever , North Korea has already secured an internal economic foundation , thanks to which citizens do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAt the Eighth Congress of the Korean Workers \u2019 Party last month , General Secretary Kim Jong Un admitted that the five-year economic development strategy had fallen short of meeting its goals in almost every category , but this should not be construed as a complete failure of North Korean economy .\nBesides , the economic recession caused by COVID-19 is a global phenomenon , not just for North Korea .\nUnder the sanctions regime , it will be difficult for North Korea to achieve economic prosperity through its self-reliance strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining the status quo or achieving a low level of gradual economic development .\n[ 1 ] Second , Cha argues that North Korea will not be able to obtain a vaccine for COVID-19 in the near future ; thus , it will have no choice but to continuously block its borders and , as a result , the economy will not be able to survive for a year or longer .\nHowever , his claim is groundless speculation .\nWe find it hard to agree with the argument that China will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially since it has already supplied them to Southeast Asian and African countries .\nAccording to our research , the North Korean government has already secured hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses from China .\nGiven that the North Korean government desperately wants the revitalization of foreign trade that is not subject to sanctions , it is highly likely to vaccinate trade workers first .\nDepending on whether the COVID-19 situation improves , trade between North Korea and China is expected to resume as early as this spring or in the fall at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean economy is predicted to gradually turn to a recovery path after hitting a low point in 2020 and the first half of 2021 , when it faced a triple whammy of sanctions , natural disasters and the coronavirus pandemic .\nAt the recent Party Congress , 7,000 people attended meetings without wearing masks for the main events .\n[ 2 ] This suggests that North Korea is in control of COVID-19 , or there is at least no massive infection .\nAlthough a combination of COVID-19 and sanctions negatively impacts the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to economic collapse .\nThird , although Dr. Cha contends that via this Party Congress , North Korea hinted at pursuing anti-market policies to overcome economic difficulties , the government is unlikely to do so .\nIf anything , Cha \u2019 s argument seems to be based on a lack of understanding of the changes in economic policies in the Kim Jong Un era .\nIn the past , North Korean markets existed outside the national economy and were spontaneously expanded by people seeking their own survival .\nBut in the Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the structure of the national economy .\nIn other words , the markets belong to the economic arena managed by the government .\nIn fact , Kim \u2019 s economic policy enables factories , enterprises and citizens to utilize markets for facilitating the supply and distribution of products .\nAs economic reforms have expanded and been institutionalized since Kim \u2019 s ascension to power , the government has not pursued a policy of suppressing market activity .\nTherefore , it is highly unlikely that the government would transform its economic policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trying to eliminate markets , unless serious abnormal symptoms spring up .\nThe failed currency reform in 2009 makes the government in Pyongyang likely to refrain from undertaking an anti-market policy .\nDenuclearization Is Still an Option Fourth , Cha contends that at this Party Congress , Kim Jong Un made it clear that he does not intend to negotiate on denuclearization with the Biden administration .\nHowever , such an argument is based on a priori assumptions , not observation or analysis of what actually transpired at the Congress .\nAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denuclearization nor stated that he has no intention to denuclearize .\nBefore this Congress , the DPRK government has repeatedly announced that it will persist in developing strategic weapons until the United States withdraws its hostile policy towards North Korea .\nThe DPRK \u2019 s position on denuclearization has always been conditional .\nTherefore , the plan for developing strategic weapons announced at this Congress can not be interpreted as a final statement that North Korea does not have a willingness to denuclearize .\nRecent moves by North Korea show that although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility first , it has a willingness to negotiate on denuclearization with the Biden administration .\nDuring this transition period of American leadership , North Korea has not made any provocations against the United States in rhetoric or action from the election to the present .\nThis is contrary to the past when North Korea made provocations to test the United States whenever a new US administration was about to start its term , including the time before and after President Obama \u2019 s inauguration .\nAdditionally , the military parade commemorating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biden \u2019 s inauguration , did not display any ICBM ( intercontinental ballistic missile ) that always appeared to provoke the United States in previous military parades .\nWhat do these signs point to ?\nIt is fair to interpret that if the United States does not provoke North Korea first , it will likewise not provoke the United States and that the government in Pyongyang is leaving room open for nuclear negotiations with the Biden administration .\nAt the recent Party Congress , Kim Jong Un reaffirmed that the future relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on changes in the United States \u2019 position .\nContrary to Cha \u2019 s argument that North Korea does not intend to denuclearize , the North is sending a message that it will wait for the United States to take a new approach .\nIn conclusion , it can be said that Cha \u2019 s article presents inaccurate descriptions and distorted views of North Korea \u2019 s reality .\nThe DPRK is highly unlikely to enter a systemic crisis or face regime collapse .\nThus , there is almost no possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external enemies for internal control or lose control of its nuclear weapons .\nWe need to face the fact that the North Korean regime survived an extreme crisis in the mid-to-late-1990s , during which about two million people died of starvation .\nThe idea of North Korean collapse is a persistent fallacy , almost a mythology in US foreign policy thinking .\nPolicies built on such a fallacy are doomed to fail .\nThere should be no more mistakes : The lack of understanding and distorted perspectives on North Korea

has spoken of moving to \u2018 carbon neutral \u2019 without specifying the means of change .\nSome others use carbon neutral as an excuse to go back to nuclear power .\nAt the moment I think they

completes 100 days today .\nThe movement continues to challenge the notorious \u2018 Three Farm Acts \u2019 that would herald unprecedented levels of corporate control over agriculture , nullifying the mandi system , diminishing the significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and opening up the possibility of alienation of farmlands to big corporations .\nLandowning farmers , marginal farmers and agricultural workers , in particular women across all categories , stand to lose by these laws .\nIn addition , this will lead to a general increase of dominance of big corporates such as the Adanis and Ambanis over rural governance and agriculture , enhancing the already existing \u201c Company Raj \u201d .\nFor more than 7 months , the entire nation witnessed farmers across the country on the streets , raising their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeopardize their already precarious situation and also eventually disband the public distribution system ( PDS ) .\nDiverse sections of civil society and concerned citizens extended support at many places .\nThe farmers and farm workers of Punjab , a state which not only thrives on agriculture but also one that has a long history of farmer unionism have been leading since Day 1 .\nUnder the leadership of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha , consisting of over five hundred farmers \u2019 organizations across the country , along with the All India Kisan Sangharsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers arrived at the borders of Delhi in late November , with thousands of tractors from Punjab .\nThey staged historic sit-ins at Singhu , Tikri and Ghazipur throughout the cold winter months .\nThe farmers have also staged roadblocks and rail blockades , peacefully and democratically to communicate their points to the largely unresponsive government and the middle-class power holders in India \u2019 s cities .\nHowever , the Govt.\n, continuing its anti-people and authoritarian approach , refused to listen to the farmers who complained that they were never consulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite being the primary stakeholders .\nThe Govt , its right-wing affiliates and lapdog media houses made multiple attempts to vilify the farmers \u2019 movement , spread fake narratives , clamp down on the protest , inflict injury , undertake arrests etc .\nThe Centre even imposed a de facto economic and transportation blockage of Punjab .\nHowever , none of these modes of repression worked in the face of the tremendous resistance of the farming-toiling class .\nWith their increased participation and leadership , the women farmers and elderly farmers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misogynist comments by that CJI , asking why they were \u2018 kept \u2019 in the protest .\nThe central role played by women farmers in keeping the movement alive at the borders of Delhi , in the villages of Punjab and elsewhere is awe-inspiring .\nOver the months , the movement snowballed across the length and breadth of the country , intensifying the demand for a complete repeal of the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Bill , calling for a legally guaranteed MSP for all crops , for slashing of diesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee Report ( in particular C2+50 ) .\nThe government \u2019 s refusal to accept the farmers \u2019 demands , despite repeated meetings , eventually strengthened the struggle and over the last two months , the movement took wings throughout Western Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand , Haryana and Rajasthan .\nMultiple maha-panchayats and rallies have been convened , in which lakhs of people participated , with the inspiring presence of women in some of them .\nToday , the protestors have blocked major roads leading to Delhi and resolved to continue their struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we extend our solidarity , we deeply appreciate the historic achievements of the movement so far .\nWithin Punjab , it has been able to galvanize the non-farming sections and create a region-wide political churning against centralized pro-corporate Hindutva rule .\nThe movement has brought back the \u201c farmer \u201d at the heart of the political discourse , as a category of people pitted against corporate rule .\nThis is an important achievement in times when we stand in real danger of Hindutva-corporate rule being normalized .\nUnsurprisingly , and significantly , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious polarization in Western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana which the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) had engineered through communal riots in 2013 , from which it had reaped massive electoral benefits .\nThe Govt was also forced to enter into multiple rounds of consultations with the farm unions , although it was never sincere in its commitment to understand and address the core issues .\nThe pressure from the movement made the Govt announce shelving of the Electricity Amendment Bill and the Ordinance to \u2018 Check Air Quality Deterioration in NCR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fines on the farmers .\nEven the Supreme Court had to take cognizance of the protests and stayed away from interfering with the farmers \u2019 right to agitate peacefully .\nRecently , the movement has been able to enlist the support of several non-BJP political parties and the central trade unions \u2013 by extending solidarity to the latter \u2019 s stance against the Labour Codes \u2013 and joined the No Vote to BJP Campaign that has been going on in election-bound Bengal .\nIn other words , the farmers \u2019 movement has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaved alliances with social movements , trade unions and political parties , in order to throw up a potent political opposition to the BJP \u2019 s anti-federal , Hindutva/corporate rule .\nNAPM salutes all the farmers of the country and in particular those camping at Delhi for 100 days , braving the biting cold and the cold-hearted government .\nWe respectfully remember each of the 248 farmers whose lives were lost in the past few months , only because of this callous regime .\nWe firmly believe that it is high time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers who are

down menu on the top banner of our home page ( Desktop version ) .\nMarch 5 , 2021 marks the 100th Day of the sit-in of more than half a million farmers and workers and it is indeed an unthinkable affair compared to farmers \u2019 movements that happened in the recent past .\nIt will not be irrelevant if we probe a little bit of history to understand its uniqueness .\nIn the past , we have seen bigger and longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940s like the glorious Telangana and Tebhaga movements which continued for years .\nBut , in the 1980s , the revolutionary peasants \u2019 movement subsided or was subsiding ( except some flares , e.g.\n, in some districts of undivided Bihar , Andhra and some pockets of Punjab too ) ; whereas various \u2018 national \u2019 movements were rising \u2014 like the Assam movement in Assam from late 1970s , the Jharkand movement , the Punjab movement or Khalistan movement , which based itself at first on the 1973 Ananpur Sahib Resolutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc ) .\nFrom that decade we have been seeing a different kind of Farmers movement .\nThose movements were led by the capitalist landlords ( a good term coined by prof. Utsa Patnaik ) and rich peasants and served the interest of these classes and stratum .\nWe saw different kinds of slogans ( related to remunerative prices of crops / higher MSP , and lower inputs prices / input-subsidy ) .\nWe also saw different forms of movement ( rasta-roko , rail-roko , along with sit-in/seize/satyagraha etc , naturally which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 railway-strike ) .\nAll those started in a big way in 1983 Nashik Movement led by Sharad Joshi and then , Mahendra Singh Tikait of BKU carried the baton .\nBtw , these \u2018 roko \u2019 forms also entered toiling peoples \u2019 movement as a \u2018 last resort \u2019 to make the deaf govt .\nadministration hear the voices of workers or for some urgent local demands , for example the Kanpur Cotton Textile workers conducted their famous 5-day rail roko 1989 , and we also saw many such rail/road blockades in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory was locked out .\nAnyway , under Mahendra Singh Tikait \u2019 s leadership we saw very long protests : 77-day Ghaziabad protest in 1992 , 1-month seize of Lucknow in the same year , 110 days Rajabpur Satyagraha , to mention a few .\nDemands were : more compensation for land , cheaper electricity , fertiliser subsidy , higher MSP , loan waiver etc .\nThis very scrappy and sketchy \u2018 history \u2019 points to transition of peasant- movement to \u2018 farmers movement \u2019 mainly in the interest of capitalist landlords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two demands : ( 1 ) remunerative prices ( Swaminathan Commission recommendation = 150 % of cost of production ) and ( 2 ) Farm Loan Waiver .\nThe very decorative movements of recent years , like the CPIM of AIKS led Nashik to Mumbai Kisan Long March in 2018 , the BKU ( Tikait ) led Kisan Kranti Yatra of 2018 , the 2018 Dilli Chalo by Yogendra Yadav led umbrella body AIKSCC , the much-hyped 2017 Tamil Nadu Farmers protest in Delhi by an organisation which supports the crazy idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category .\nWhy these protests , even the CPIM led Maharashtra Long March also serves interest of capitalist landlords and rich peasants and are UNABLE TO SERVE the interests of poor and middle peasants is a different question and it was dealt with in several articles by this author like \u201c There are \u2018 farmers \u2019 and farmers \u201d in Countercurrents , Apr 13 , 2018 .\nEverybody of those parties and organisations comfortably forgot the question of increasing wages of agricultural labourers , the question of land to the landless , anti-usury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that were still in vogue in the 1970s .\nBut what started mainly in Punjab villages in August-September 2020 and converged to Delhi border points ( Singhu and Tikri ) on Nov 26 , 2020 and their continuing protest for 100 days at a stretch , including a Tractor Rally in Delhi on Jan-26 , and which is continuing even after death of more than 260 fighters and arrest of hundreds\u2026 is really a unique one .\nHere , the demand that came in the forefront is repealing the three agriculture laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more highlight than the demand of MSP as was proved by several rounds of talks between farmer leaders and govt .\nnegotiators .\nThe farmers organisations want nothing short of total repeal of these three agricultural laws .\nThere are some important points : ( 1 ) These three Agri-laws are not only totally anti-peasant ( poor , middle , rich peasants ) and anti-farmer ( farmer in the sense that who owns and operates/manages a farm depending on labourers ) , but also against all toiling people , as the Law 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( outside the new govt .\ndefinition of essential commodities ) .\n( 2 ) Moreover , the movement to repeal these laws is definitely a movement against corporatisation and also anti-imperialist ( by defying the W.B.-I.M.F .\ndictum for agriculture ) .\nNo political parties that enjoyed governmental power or vie to enjoy that ( including the CPI , CPIM etc lefts parties ) can not and did not do any \u2018 movement \u2019 in real sense that may hurt interests of foreign and/or desi corporate bodies or foreign and desi capitalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present movement could not be controlled by such political parties ; the farmers unions and labourers \u2019 bodies independent of those conceived this movement and are the main driving force of this movement .\nThey are in control of this movement .\n( 4 ) Farmers and labourers of many states like Punjab , Haryana , Rajasthan , Western-UP , Uttarakhand now control large farmer-labourer assembled forces at different borders .\nOf course , there are also some from Maharashtra , but anyway , leaders like Hanna Molla of CPIM or Yogendra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dominate or rein in the movement .\n( 5 ) BKU ( Tikait ) and likeminded unions also made this demand , repeal of farm laws , their central demand , and did not insist on focusing Swaminathan Recommendation and loan waiver like they did in their previous movements .\n( 6 ) Moreover , this movement could bring some changes in the BKU fractions mainly working in western Uttar Pradesh .\nFor example \u2013 Tikait openly confessed that supporting BJP was a big mistake ; many Mahapanchayats were organised each attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders promised to distance themselves from BJP ; they confessed that making anti-Muslim riot was a very big mistake and they will never do it again ; talks of unity cutting across castes and religions were there , the \u2018 identity \u2019 of toiling people resurfaced , that \u2018 identity \u2019 for which they can feed themselves , their family members and all non-farm people of the country .\nIt is indeed heartening to see Hindu-Muslim Unity resurfacing at such places in the Yogi-Raj where the soil was blood-stained by notorious anti-Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unity , Sikh-Hindu Unity were forged to smash the govt .\nplan to divide the movement in the January days .\nHow a struggle can change minds , how a struggle can teach !\nOne particular farmers \u2019 organisation , the BKU ( Ekta Ugrahan ) took some extra steps that must be appreciated .\nFor example , in the first phase of the sit-in , they observed one day as \u2018 Human Rights Day \u2019 , and demanded release of all political social activists who are imprisoned with false allegations .\nRecently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Punjab toilers how imperialism is linked with these farm laws and why our struggle must be anti-imperialist .\nThey staged a big workers-peasants united rally where more than two-hundred-thousand workers and peasants after weeks of preparation .\nThe farm labourers \u2019 union explained to the workers the need of workers-peasants unity in this and in the future struggles .\nThey could show in some of their programmes that jawan-kisan unity is not just a slogan .\nBut sadly , and it is the most important point now , the states where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the domination of the parliamentary parties and not the so-called \u2018 independent \u2019 farmers organisation , e.g.\n, Bengal , Andhra , Tamil Nadu , Assam , etc there those parties did not yet take concrete steps for organising masses towards anti-Farm-Acts movement like Punjab and Haryana .\nThey issued only statements in the media .\nCPIM chief even wrote in his article to make new farm laws after repealing these ones after discussing , even with concerned corporate capitalists !\n( For example , you may see this . )\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those once connected with revolutionary movement in Bengal that they could also not stir the masses by agitation-propaganda , Bengal did not see any move like boycotting Adani-Ambani shops/pumps including boycotting Ambani \u2019 s or Reliance \u2019 s JIO as farmers in Punjab did as token gestures against corporatisation of agriculture , the laws , and steps taken by Adani , Ambani etc capitalists .\nEven Tata is perhaps now eager to take on \u2018 Big Baskets \u2019 that supply not only grocery products but also fish , meat and etc at doorsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Feb 28 by the alliance of CPIM etc Left parties with Indian National Congress and a new outfit named ISF led by a Pirzada did not raise or emphasise the slogan of repealing the three anti-people farm laws !\nThey did/could not say that if voted to govt .\npower they would never implement those laws in WB ( agriculture being a state subject ) !\nThe onus is now on communist revolutionaries and there are toiling people who want to fight , who are disenchanted with the parliamentary parties .\nElection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .\nWe must clarify to thousands of toiling masses what the three farm laws really mean and what would be the consequences \u2013 it is not impossible to do \u2013 we must try to do as much as we can .\nWe are to clarify why this matters more than all the electoral speeches , promises and jibes of all parliamentary parties .\nWhy this election campaign can not evade the birding questions of farm laws and labour laws .\nWe must try to explain that no-vote-to-BJP is NOT the ONLY important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitations by the toiling masses against the farm laws , and these are also very important now \u2013 these farm laws and labour laws are concrete deeds of the BJP led govt .\nagainst the toilers and for the interest of desi and foreign capitalists We must tell the masses why toiling masses should try to design steps , however small , against these farm laws , why toiling people should not put any faith in parliamentary parties .\nThere is another encouraging sign : We are seeing many environmental activists are up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It started not from the Greta tweet as the media reported .\nMuch back , several environmental activists and organisations , who were against the severe damage caused by the imperialist-sponsored Green revolution , studied the farm laws and saw in those again an attempt to develop the Indian part of global-food-production chain led by the big imperialist multinational corporate bodies and their Indian counterparts .\nThey understood how anti people and anti nature will be the effects of these laws .\nThey have already started to take programs on their own to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also among the intelligentsia .\nWe need to cooperate as much as possible keeping in mind many constraints ( like disenchantment of many environmentalists regarding practices of \u2018 communist countries \u2019 etc ) .\nAt this moment , joining forces against the farm laws may be given priority .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above

characterizes the response of many in Sorong , a district in Indonesia \u2019 s easternmost region of Papua , to the deforestation unfolding in their area .\nJemris is an environmental activist based in Papua , home to the last great expanse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s commodities boom of recent decades \u2014 from palm oil to coal to pulpwood \u2014razed much of the forests on the western islands of Sumatra and Borneo .\nNow , those same industries are moving into Papua , where authorities have issued licenses that could result in the clearing of an area the size of Sydney .\nThat \u2019 s the finding from a new report by a coalition of 11 NGOs in Indonesia , which shows that most of the 1.1 million hectares ( 2.7 million acres ) of natural forest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be converted into oil palm plantations .\nThese licenses are known as forest conversion permits , which are required by law to allow plantations and infrastructure projects to be established in forest areas .\nDedy Sukmara , a researcher at the environmental NGO Auriga , a member of the coalition , said the issuance of these permits effectively legitimizes large-scale forest clearing .\nAnd this could spell disaster for the region \u2019 s wildlife and plants .\nPapua \u2019 s forests are among the most biodiverse on Earth , home to at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125 mammals and 223 reptiles .\nHistorically , the issuance of forest conversion licenses has been followed to a small extent by deforestation , but new regulations could mean an even higher rate of clearing .\nFrom 1992 to 2019 , the government issued such licenses for 1.57 million hectares ( 3.8 million acres ) of forest areas , of which 1.3 million hectares ( 3.2 million acres ) were for plantations .\nAs of 2019 , 11 % of the 1.3 million hectares had been deforested , accounting for nearly a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 663,443 hectares ( 1.6 million acres ) , over the past two decades .\nUnder new regulations that set a tighter deadline for when license holders must start cultivating on their land , companies would be compelled to clear their concessions sooner or face punishment , Dedy said .\nIn response to the NGOs \u2019 report , the Ministry of Environment and Forestry released its own data showing there are at least 1.26 million hectares ( 3.1 million acres ) of natural forests remaining in the areas that have already been earmarked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests have remained largely intact , with only 2,645 hectares ( 6,536 acres ) of deforestation identified by the ministry by January 2021 .\nThe ministry said it monitors this trend as part of wider efforts following up on a 2018 government moratorium on issuing new permits for oil palm plantations .\nThe moratorium was imposed to improve the sustainability of the industry , and also calls for a review of existing permits .\nThe ministry said the monitoring by the central government is especially important because there have been no recommendations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in areas that are still forested .\nThe island of New Guinea is split between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea .\nMufthi Fathul Barri , a researcher with Forest Watch Indonesia ( FWI ) , another member of the NGO coalition , said monitoring alone is not enough to make sure the natural forests in the areas already licensed remain intact .\nIn addition to a freeze on new oil palm permits and review of existing permits , the government should enforcing the law on violating companies and recognize the rights of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe cited the Tanah Merah mega plantation project in Papua \u2019 s Boven Digoel district , a deforestation hotspot , as a litmus test for the ministry and the oil palm plantation moratorium .\nThe Tanah Merah site , earmarked mostly for oil palm , could on its own lead to the clearing of up to 280,000 hectares ( 692,000 acres ) of rainforest \u2014 an area nearly twice the size of New York City .\nBut the multibillion-dollar project has been mired in a litany of controversies , with a 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing how permits were issued by an official in jail on corruption charges ; Indigenous peoples were coerced into relinquishing the rights to their ancestral lands ; and the true identities of the individuals behind the project were concealed behind fake nominees and shell companies in tax havens .\nIn 2019 , allegations emerged that fake licenses had been issued to some of the operators involved in the project .\nOfficials from the Papua provincial investment agency also alleged that permits for the seven concessions at the Tanah Merah site were falsified at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhile the permits bore the signature of the former head of the agency , he has reported in writing that it was forged .\nThe allegations were uncovered in a follow-up investigation by Mongabay and The Gecko Project .\nIn 2016 , Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar referred to the project , though not by name , when discussing the progress of the ministry \u2019 s review of licenses in Papua .\nSiti added that these trades involved 20 % of the areas that should have been allocated for local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already done into the project , and with the minister \u2019 s own acknowledgement of its maladministration , Mufthi said there \u2019 s no reason for the ministry to not take further action .\nTo follow up on the Tanah Merah case and address the loopholes that have allowed it to happen in the first place , the ministry doesn \u2019 t have to wait for recommendations from local governments , Mufthi said .\nTo protect forests for which conversion permits have already been issued after the moratorium expires at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket ban on the clearance of all natural forests , regardless of whether permits have been issued or not , said Dedy from Auriga .\nThe government in 2011 did issue a moratorium on clearing primary forests and peatlands , which was made permanent in 2019 .\nBut it doesn \u2019 t cover secondary forests , defines as those where there has been some degree of human activity , but which also host a large proportion of Indonesia \u2019 s remaining natural forests , with high levels of biodiversity and tree cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madani shows there are at least 9.5 million hectares ( 23.5 million acres ) of natural forests that aren \u2019 t covered by the moratorium , of which only 1 million hectares ( 2.5 million acres ) consist of primary forests that were licensed out before the moratorium came into force .\nThe forestry ministry said it had identified natural forests with high conservation value ( HCV ) and high carbon stock ( HCS ) in Papua in an effort to protect them .\nAccording to the ministry , these areas may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would protect

radioactive material that were in a reactor \u2019 s core and then released to the environment by an accident .\nThese models are revised as we learn more about the prevailing winds and other factors but are still only models ; ideally , one wants to examine the reactors \u2019 cores themselves .\nUnfortunately , even 10 years later , no one can get close to Fukushima \u2019 s reactor cores , and we do not even know precisely where they are located .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Nuclear Regulatory Authority ( NRA ) announced \u201c extremely serious \u201d developments at Fukushima that were far worse than previously thought , the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported .\nTEPCO had discovered that the massive shield plugs covering the reactors were emitting 10 Sieverts of radiation per hour\u2014a lethal dose for humans ( though it should be noted that reactor cores are normally examined by robots , unless these , too , are destroyed by radiation ) .\nBecause Fukushima now has more contaminated material at higher doses than previously estimated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole process of decommissioning work , \u201d said NRA chairman Toyoshi Fuketa .\nThe effective dose of radiation required to sicken or kill you is measured in Sieverts , a unit named after Rolf Sievert , the Swedish physicist who first calibrated the lethal effects of radioactive energy .\nA dose of 0.75 Sieverts will produce nausea and a weakened immune system .\n( Sieverts are used to measure the relative biological damage done to the human body , while becquerels and curies are units that describe the amount of radiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of 10 Sieverts will kill you , if absorbed all at once .\nA dose somewhere in-between 0.75 and 10 Sieverts gives you a fifty-fifty chance of dying within 30 days .\nGuidelines for workers in the nuclear industry limit the maximum yearly dose to 0.05 Sieverts , or 50 milliSieverts\u2014the equivalent of five CT scans , says Harvard Health Publishing .\n( This is a high figure compared to the 1 milliSievert per year that is considered acceptable for the general public ; a physicist familiar with the industry explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear energy industry are implicitly being paid to take on the risk . )\nSo how many Sieverts are currently being produced by Fukushima \u2019 s melted reactors ?\nThe latest reading from reactor No .\n2 is 530 Sieverts per hour .\nThis means that every hour the heart of the reactor is emitting more than 10,000 times the yearly allowable dose for radiation workers .\nF1 \u2019 s reactors are still radioactively hot .\nThey are lethal to humans who approach them and even the robots sent to explore the melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TEPCO lost two robots in two weeks .\nBut some of the nuclear exclusion

still in the zone .\nAn army of about 100,000 workers has spent a decade scraping up and bagging radioactively contaminated soil .\nConsequently , what were once the emerald green rice paddies of

airborne radiation levels found in other parts of the world .\nBut these airborne releases are only part of the story\u2014and not the most worrisome part .\nIn 2013 , scientists discovered that Fukushima \u2019 s exploding reactors had showered Japan with microparticles , or little glassy beads , of radioactive cesium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microparticles can be found in vacuum cleaner bags and automobile air filters as far away as Tokyo .\nFukushima prefecture is full of radioactive hot spots , and these hot spots keep moving as microparticles are washed down from the forested mountains that make up 70 percent of the prefecture , researchers said in Nature Scientific Reports .\nIn 2019 , a survey conducted for Greenpeace found hot spots in the J-Village parking lot , where children

) \u20141,775 times higher than the normal reading in this area before the Fukushima disaster of about 0.04 microSieverts per hour .\nThe elevated reading , which translates to roughly about 0.62 Sieverts over the course of a year , meant that anyone breathing dust from the J-Village playing fields could be ingesting radioactive particles\u2014little death stars lighting the way to cancer and

Japan covered up the risks involved in building 54 nuclear reactors on its geologically unstable shores , it is now covering up the consequences .\nA government-sponsored study of radiation exposure in Fukushima prefecture undercounted people \u2019 s exposure by two-thirds .\nAustralian physician Tilman Ruff , co-founder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize ) , wrote me to say that doctors have left the area because the government refuses to reimburse them when they list radiation sickness as the cause for nose bleeds , spontaneous abortions , and other ailments resulting from ionizing radiation .\n( The only acceptable diagnoses are so-called \u201c radiophobia , \u201d nervousness , and stress . )\nThe spike in thyroid cancer among children in Fukushima is dismissed as a survey error , produced by examining too many children .\nThe government has mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has established no baseline for comparing public health before and after the disaster .\nInstead , it has greenlighted the use of radioactive ash and soil from Fukushima in construction projects throughout the country , the Japan Times reported .\nThe generally accepted safety standard for radiation exposure is one milliSievert , or one-thousandth of a Sievert , per year .\nDifferent countries have different standards , but in the United States , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that the operators of nuclear power plants limit the amount of their incidental radiation exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 milliSievert ( 1,000 microSieverts ) per year above the average annual background radiation , and this figure has become a sort of rough international average benchmark .\n( For comparison \u2019 s sake , the natural level of background radiation usually averages in the range of up to as much as 3 milliSieverts annually . )\nBut in its haste to deal with the Fukushima emergency in the months after the accident , the Japanese government simply raised the limit of what was considered an acceptable amount of incidental radiation coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese government now allows individuals in Fukushima prefecture to be exposed to 20 milliSieverts per year of incidental radiation , above and beyond what was emitted naturally , reported Scientific American .\nFigures like these are a far cry from that international average benchmark of 1 milliSievert annually .\nTo give a sense of scale , a figure in the 20 milliSieverts range means that a schoolchild in Fukushima can be exposed to the same amount of radiation as the average adult working full-time in a nuclear power plant .\nThe limit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fukushima \u2019 s environs , remains 1 milliSievert per year .\n21st-century versions of hibakusha , or \u201c bomb-affected people \u201d ?\nAnyone objecting to Fukushima \u2019 s 20-fold increase in allowable radiation exposure is criticized for promoting \u201c harmful rumors.\n\u201d After China and 50 other countries banned the importation of food from Fukushima on the grounds that it might be radioactive , the Japanese authorities reacted vehemently , and critics of the Japanese government \u2019 s response to the

greater numbers than their wives , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as possible .\n\u201c Japan has clamped down on scientific efforts to study the nuclear catastrophe , \u201d said Alex Rosen , a pediatrician who co-chairs the German affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War .\n\u201c There is hardly any literature , any publicized research , on the health effects on humans ,

.\nContradicting his earlier research and instructions to his own staff , Yamashita told the public that 100 milliSieverts of radiation was harmless .\nHe recommended against administering iodine pills to prevent thyroid cancer , and told people that their best protection against radiation poisoning was literally to smile and be happy . )\nFour thousand people continue to labor daily to contain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling water into reactor cores and fuel pools , while struggling to keep the damaged buildings from collapsing .\nMore than a billion liters of contaminated water\u2014the equivalent of 480 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u2014are stored on-site in rusting tanks .\nClaiming that it has run out of storage room , TEPCO is planning to release this water directly into the

woman stepping out of her home be required to register herself with her local police station so that the police can track her for her safety .\nChief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde asked last month why women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers \u2019 protests and praised Supreme Court advocate AP Singh ( a man with a record of victim-blaming and support for honour crimes ) for giving an assurance that women would be sent home and kept out of the protests .\nAs an Indian woman , these developments fill me with a sense of foreboding and panic .\nChouhan and Bobde are men with immense power , who do not feel obligated to listen to the voices of women .\nTheir whims carry the weight of authority .\nWe need to tell these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a \u201c problem \u201d for which confinement and surveillance are the \u201c solution \u201d .\nWomen are not \u201c things \u201d owned by men , which need to be \u201c protected \u201d from theft or damage .\nWomen are people with the inalienable right to live the fullest of lives .\nEverything that prevents their life from being lived to the fullest extent of freedom is a form of violence .\nViolence against autonomy is , by far , the most widespread and the least acknowledged form of gender-based violence in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discuss this fact .\nNational Family Health Survey data shows that just 42 % of women with no schooling , and 45 % of women with schooling , have the right to go \u201c alone to the market , to the health centre , and outside the community \u201d .\nAn India Human Development Survey ( IHDS ) found that even those women who could go out alone \u2014 to workplaces , for instance \u2014 are expected to seek permission from some authority figure in the household to do so .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalit , educated and socially disadvantaged caste ( OBC ) and adivasi ( indigenous ) women experience restrictions on mobility , to more or less the same extent as women from more privileged castes .\nRape or sexual assault is violence against women \u2019 s autonomy \u2014 that is , her control over her own body .\nConfinement to the home and surveillance inside and outside the home is also violence against women \u2019 s autonomy .\nRequiring women to take permission from authority figures in the family to step out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomy .\nRequiring women to inform state authorities ( like the police ) of their movements outside the home is violence against women \u2019 s autonomy .\nRequiring women to seek permission from the state to convert to another faith or marry someone from a different caste or community is violence against women \u2019 s autonomy .\nWithholding the right of a woman to take risks ( by protesting in cold weather for instance ) is violence against women \u2019 s autonomy .\nA man is not asked to explain and answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nThe \u201c outside \u201d is accepted as his natural sphere .\nThe very fact that a woman is expected to answer to others for her presence \u201c outside her house \u201d proves that the house is in fact a prison for a very large number of women .\nAs Shilpa Phadke \u2019 s 2011 book Why Loiter eloquently asserts , women have a right to loiter without purpose , and it is only by asserting and defending this right that women can truly have a claim to their city .\nThose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedoms in the name of \u201c safety \u201d are the most likely to voice rape culture that blames victims , not perpetrators , for sexual violence .\nSingh is a handy example .\nHe declared , in the context of the Delhi gang rape and murder in 2012 , \u201c if my daughter was having premarital sex and moving around at night with her boyfriend , I would have burnt her alive .\nAll parents should adopt such an attitude.\n\u201d The man who justified rape of a woman on the grounds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend , says today that women must stay home and keep out of protests \u2014 and the Chief Justice agrees with him .\nWhat a disturbing and dangerous meeting of minds .\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and the fascist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) act as though the Manusmriti ( a religious script declaring that women are never free , and must always be in the custody of their father , husband or son ) is India \u2019 s Constitution \u2014 and they boast that their views and policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of Indians , while feminist ideas are confined to an isolated , \u201c westernised \u201d minority .\nBJP leader Ram Madhav boasted in an Indian Express op-ed in 2017 that this liberal , feminist minority , which had enjoyed an influence out of proportion to its size , was finally out of the driver \u2019 s seat , and \u201c The mob , humble people of the country , are behind [ Prime Minister Narendra ] Modi .\nThey are finally at ease with a government that looks and sounds familiar .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ op-ed in the same paper in 2019 , Madhav called for the \u201c pseudo-secular/liberal cartels that held a disproportionate sway and stranglehold over the intellectual and policy establishment of the country \u201d to be purged from \u201c the country \u2019 s academic , cultural and intellectual landscape \u201d under Modi \u2019 s second term as PM .\nPeople \u2019 s movements in India ( trade union , students \u2019 , feminist , anti-caste , civil liberties and environmental movements ) aim , like Dalit rights campaigner B R Ambedkar , to democratise Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by masses of ordinary people , not by liberal intellectuals .\nFrom educators Savitribai Phule and Fatima Sheikh , to anti-dowry campaigners Shahjahan Apa and Satyarani Chaddha , feminist organisers are the products of Indian soil , fighting for a more democratic India .\nAs we have seen , NFHS data does show that regressive anti-feminist ideas and practices are still widespread in India .\nBut until six years ago , women could still appeal to the courts , at least , and be fairly confident that the outcome would uphold constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no basis for such complacence .\nWith the BJP and RSS controlling government and influencing every institution , women \u2019 s legally recognised liberties hang by a thread .\nAll that stands between women and regressive laws legalising the shackles on their autonomy are the courts .\nAnd the sheer number of judges who seem to have no understanding or respect for the very concept of women \u2019 s autonomy and constitutional morality does not inspire confidence .\nIt is no coincidence , after all , that some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to name a few \u2014 advocate Sudha Bharadwaj and teacher Shoma Sen , student activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita of Pinjra Tod , Ishrat Jahan and Gulfisha ) are in prison today under draconian laws , and no judge seems able to see and end the appalling injustice of their incarceration .\nOur rights rest on the chance that the judge who gets to weigh in on such regressive policies and laws will be guided by constitutional morality , and not by his own patriarchal common sense .\nThat is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s movements , and the extraordinary courage of ordinary women in the face of fascist assaults , that supply the confidence that the Courts do not .\nWe draw courage from the young women like Muskanwho tell violent mobs that she is an adult and has a right to marry whom she pleases .\nWe draw courage from the young women out to loiter and break the cages of hostels and homes even as leaders of these movements are thrown in prison .\nWe draw courage from the elderly , grey-haired women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 rights , and refuse to be treated like school kids and \u201c sent home \u201d by paternalistic judges .\nThe followers of the Manusmriti are afraid of the change that women \u2019 s movements can bring .\nAnd we can smell their fear .\nAnd their fear dispels ours .\nSo Messrs Chouhan , Adityanath and company , the honourable chief justice and other honourable judges \u2014 we are not going to be boxed up by you .\nWe refuse to show you papers to prove our citizenship .\nWe refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to allow courts to decide if obnoxious , regressive \u201c laws \u201d and policies are legitimate or not \u2014 we will defy them and refuse to obey them no matter what the judges think .\nWe are going to wash the dirty linen in public \u2014 and expose the violence inside our homes .\nWe need no one \u2019 s permission to break our cages .\nWe are here on the streets \u2014 and here we are going to stay .\nGet used to it

communicative power of Barack Obama \u2014 a \u201c mixture of Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy \u201d .\nModi \u2019 s communication skills are of a different kind .\nHe lacks Obama \u2019 s deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loops and symbolism and his inspiring , compelling eloquence .\nBut Modi created a strong non-conformist first impression at the Quad summit .\nModi \u2019 s remarks added up to just 105 words \u2014 in comparison with his voluble American counterpart Joe Biden \u2019 s 560 words , his ebullient Australian counterpart Scott Morrison \u2019 s 295 words and the taciturn Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga \u2019 s 215 words .\nConceivably , External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar advised the PM beforehand that discretion would be the better part of valour .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains nothing out of irritating China at this point in time .\nProbably , it \u2019 d have much to lose .\nBesides , it \u2019 s surreal to get excited about a US enterprise that the Asia-Pacific refuses to identify with .\nThis is aside the wisdom of aligning with Biden \u2019 s ambivalent , contrarian attitudes toward China .\nUnsurprisingly , America \u2019 s close European allies refuse to identify with the US approach .\nAn incisive analysis by Reuters last week summed up : The report quoted a EU diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hawkish agenda against China , which is not our agenda \u201d .\nThis is the crux of the matter .\nOne doesn \u2019 t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Biden slipped into his Quad wardrobe so early into his presidency .\nLast week , Biden \u2019 s aides were extending an invitation to high-level Chinese officials for strategic talks .\nBiden is in tearing hurry to engage with the Chinese leadership , although the US has far from coordinated with its allies a common strategy towards China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heart of the matter is that Biden has successfully signed into law his $ 1.9 Trillion American Rescue Package .\nThis would be in addition to previous $ 900 billion stimulus packages he announced in January .\nBiden said on Thursday , \u201c The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight.\n\u201d In a call to immediate action to turn things around , he added , \u201c There \u2019 s no time to waste .\nWe have to act and we have to act now.\n\u201d Biden \u2019 s American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at its core , it is about living on borrowed money in ways that will do little to improve the nation \u2019 s long-term economic outlook .\nThe overall federal debt is expected to climb to 102 % of GDP this year !\nThe point is , deficit-financed spending now on a short-term relief package could make it harder for the Biden administration to find money later for long-term investments in things like infrastructure .\nEnter China .\nThe economies of the US and China are intricately linked , due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goods and services and investment .\nThe US deficit is financed partly by capital flows from China .\nChina holds more US Treasury securities than any other foreign country except Japan .\nAccording to the US Treasury , China owned $ 1.06 trillion in US debt securities as of Sept. 2020 .\nClearly , the huge influence of the Chinese economy on Biden \u2019 s calculus can not be understated .\nChina is the only show in town for his ambitious project encapsulated in that very widely used expression \u201c Build Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his role model to be FDR \u2019 s New Deal , which is riveted on the famous \u201c Three Rs \u201d \u2014 relief ( for the unemployed ) , recovery ( through federal spending and job creation ) , and reform ( of capitalism by means of regulatory legislation and creation of new social welfare programs ) .\nBiden desperately needs the \u201c 2+2 \u201d talks in Anchorage on March 18-19 with top Chinese diplomats to reset the US-China relationship .\nBut the paradox is that he is also not ready to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beltway demands , although it has no takers abroad among America \u2019 s friends and allies .\nSimply put , the US has a tactical need to keep the Quad going while it resets the ties with China .\nThis is where Modi \u2019 s remarks show smart thinking .\nHe stated : Modi stated the minimum that was necessary for the occasion .\nEvidently , Modi enjoys claiming affinity with Biden in \u201c democratic values \u201d .\nIt has its uses too .\nBiden is a tough , wily , unsentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scathing UNHRC resolution condemning authoritarianism and repression in Egypt under President Sisi \u2014 and is threatening to impose arms embargo against that close ally bordering Israel . )\nSecond , Modi repeated \u201c our commitment to a free , open , and inclusive Indo-Pacific \u201d .\nIt is Biden \u2019 s prerogative as the self-appointed Quad chairman to drop the word \u201c inclusive \u201d from the joint statement , but for Modi it is important not to attribute any exclusivity to Quad as if it is directed against China .\nModi noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s deliberations \u2014 vaccines , climate change , and emerging technologies \u2014 and expressed confidence that such a purposive development agenda would \u201c make the Quad a force for global good.\n\u201d In essence , he flagged India \u2019 s vision of the Quad .\nDoes it look like \u201c Asian NATO \u201d ?\nEqually , Modi struck a philosophical note : \u201c I see this positive vision as an extension of India \u2019 s ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam , which regards the world as one family.\n\u201d In Modi \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate Marxist-Leninists and capitalists alike .\nModi sounded pleased that the Quad has \u201c come of age \u201d , finally .\nThe plan to finance a brand new ultra-modern vaccine factory in India testifies to maturity .\nModi hoped that the Quad \u201c will now remain an important pillar of stability in the region.\n\u201d Interestingly , in his entire remarks , Modi never once mentioned regional security .\nIndeed , Modi \u2019 s expectation will be that the newly set-up Quad Working Groups on climate and critical and emerging technology will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d projects .\nHowever , everything Biden does has a domestic resonance .\nThe Quad isn \u2019 t a seductive enough topic for American domestic opinion .\nNSA Jake Sullivan \u2019 s media briefing turned out to be a damp squib !\nFor Biden too , this summit has been quintessentially a useful catch-up on vaccine-diplomacy , as New York Times pointed out , to push back against intense pressure to donate excess coronavirus vaccines to needy nations \u201c without risking domestic political blowback from exporting doses in the coming months , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India and Russia have hopelessly outmatched the US in vaccine diplomacy .\nBiden is facing accusations of vaccine hoarding from global health advocates .\nIn the final analysis , of course , Beijing has since outwitted Biden by simply scaling up its vaccine production capacity manifold to a mammoth scale that his Quad vaccine project can not possibly compete with .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site , internet forums

handed out by the national government to augment a province \u2019 s earnings .\nIn their view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing the island will kill two birds with one stone : social services will be more accessible and officials will be \u201c closer to the people.\n\u201d Opponents of the division warn of a drastic shift in the management of the natural resources Palawan is known for , raising concerns about a possible weakening of the enforcement laws that protect the province \u2019 s already threatened ecology .\nThe island has come a long way from the penal colony that it once was , to an ecotourism haven ; a shift from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination for backpackers and jet-setters , famous even by Hollywood standards .\nFor decades , Palawan banked on its natural resources and sustainable practices to provide livelihood for communities and boost its earnings , all heavily hinged on proper environmental management .\nThe measure being put up for a vote lays out the political

Obama \u2019 s second presidential term .\nSomething unusual is hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , if it is periodically actualized .\nTo determine this oddity we must once again turn to local geography and recent history .\nThe Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are located approximately 150 km west of the southern Ryukyu Archipelago , which stretches 1,200 km from north to south from one of the four major Japanese islands , Kyushu , to Taiwan .\nFrom this last island , the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are 150 km away , from the PRC coast 300 km away .\nThis geography serves as a reason for Beijing ( as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to refer the disputed islands to the Ryukyu Archipelago .\nAnd this is where the history part comes in .\nThe fact is that the entire Ryukyu Archipelago is present in the Japan-China territorial dispute ( in the author \u2019 s view ) .\nJust as part of India \u2019 s elite has buried deep in its \u201c mental subcortex \u201d the problem of suzerainty ( not sovereignty as it is today ) of Beijing over all of Tibet .\nAlthough on the political surface there are \u201c only \u201d disputes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sino-Indian border zone .\nJust as India would like ( of course , not publicly and officially ) to see all of Tibet fairly autonomous from Beijing , so the latter would prefer ( again , not publicly ) to have a quasi-state entity called Ryukyu , with extensive autonomy from Tokyo , next to it .\nFor which there are some historical reasons .\nThe fact is that before the second half of the nineteenth century , such a quasi-state formation with its fairly autochthonous population already existed .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan began its foreign policy expansion after the so-called Meiji Restoration ( in the late 1960s ) , and mainly as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War ( 1894-95 ) .\nThe status of the adjacent Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands was not specified in any way .\nWith the end of World War II , the Ryukyu Archipelago came under US control , which in 1951 was enshrined in the San Francisco Peace Treaty ( Article 3 ) with the international legal status of trusteeship .\nHowever , this document , too , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands .\nIn 1972 , the Ryukyu Archipelago returned to Tokyo \u2019 s jurisdiction , an act of goodwill on the part of Washington toward a now key ally in Asia .\nOn lease ( but paid for by the Japanese budget ) part of the territory of Okinawa , that is , the main island of the Ryukyu Archipelago , remained the main base of the American military contingent in Japan .\nBut with the return of this archipelago to its jurisdiction , Japan also regained the unresolved status of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s view , again , the connection of this very local problem with the potential issue of the status of the entire Ryukyu Archipelago underlies the acuteness of the situation in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands area .\nAnd not so much the ( almost always mentioned ) abundance of fish and the allegedly huge hydrocarbon reserves at the bottom of the surrounding sea .\nThe latter was predicted by a certain UN commission back in the late 1960s .\nIn 2012 , the Japanese government decided to end the terra nullius status of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of three of them was found who agreed to \u201c sell \u201d them .\nSince then they have all been the \u201c property \u201d of the Japanese government .\nIt is hardly necessary to explain Beijing \u2019 s reaction to the very procedure of this \u201c sale-purchase \u201d .\nWith its accomplishment , the situation around the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands began to deteriorate steadily .\nJapan considered as an open challenge the introduction in early February of this year of China \u2019 s Border Guard Law , which , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign \u201c intruder ships \u201d in national territorial waters .\nOn February 9 , during a conversation with US charge d \u2019 affaires ad interim Joseph Young at the office of the Japanese Defense Ministry , its head Nobuo Kishi called the law \u201c absolutely unacceptable \u201d .\nTwo weeks later , there was a \u201c news leak \u201d about a conversation between a \u201c group \u201d of members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and some Japanese government representatives concerning the rights of Japanese border ships in the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands area .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ group \u201d was answered positively .\nIn other words , the situation around these islands is getting only worse .\nAnd the question of the US position is extremely important in predicting its further development .\nWhich in relation to Japan is in terms of a binding military-political alliance , and to China as the main geopolitical opponent .\nMeanwhile , during the aforementioned conversation between Joseph Youn gand Nobuo Kishi , the former only uttered a ritual mantra about his country \u2019 s commitment to the principle of \u201c freedom and openness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPR and said nothing on the subject of the issue raised by Nobuo Kishi .\nOr at least there is no mention of it in the media comments .\nArticle V is mentioned in the official report about one of President Joe Biden \u2019 s phone conversations with Prime Minister Yo .\nSuga .\nBut without any \u201c territorial \u201d reference , which contradicts the more definite interpretation of this conversation by almost all the respected news media .\nMeanwhile , in the course of the election campaign , the same Biden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as is well known , opposition \u201c blabbering \u201d and the words of an official clothed with supreme power are completely different things .\nEven in form , not to mention in content .\nThere are noticeable nuances on this issue during the press conferences of Pentagon spokesman John Kirby , which was noticed in Japan .\nIn other words , as before , we are witnessing the usual behavior of every participant in the \u201c Great World Game , \u201d seeking to benefit himself , but to avoid ( if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an entirely unnecessary reason .\nThe same can be seen in the positioning of the US in relation to the \u201c Taiwan Issue , \u201d the

Obama publicly declares that , of course , the US obligations apply to these islands as well .\nWith the uncertainty of US foreign policy in general and towards China in particular , it is quite

Website \u201d drop down menu on the top banner of our home page ( Desktop version ) .\nAbstract : The four major countries of East Asia\u2014China , Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan\u2014form one of the most densely populated regions on earth , and through the course of the late 20th and early 21st centuries the region experienced some of its fastest economic growth , propelled by the policies of state-led developmentalism .\nAs a result of this density and these policies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most environmentally degraded .\nAs each achieved middle-to-high income status , however , the populace and then the regime in each country realized that they could not sustain either rapid economic growth or popular legitimacy without addressing the environmental consequences of this fast growth .\nThe four states thus changed their fundamental economic policies from pure developmentalism to what we call eco-developmentalism , an attempt to reconcile economic prosperity with environmental sustainability .\nAlthough success so far has been mixed , this turn to eco-developmentalism has allowed these states to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia \u2019 s four largest countries2\u2014the People \u2019 s Republic of China , the Republic of China on Taiwan , Japan , and the Republic of Korea\u2014 contain some of the most densely populated regions in the world and support 21 % of the world \u2019 s population .\nTheir estimated GDP constituted about 25 % of the world \u2019 s total in 2019 ( Statistics Times 2020 ) 3 , up from just 7 % in 1960 ( World Bank n.d. ) .\nThe dramatic growth of East Asia \u2019 s economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economic success of the East Asian developmental states , which have staked their popular legitimacy on economic development and the material benefits that such growth brings to their citizens .\nAt the same time , the developmental states \u2019 extreme focus on material growth , particularly in the early decades of their high growth period , led to intense pollution and environmental catastrophes .\nBetting on the populace \u2019 s propensity to value increases in material living standards above all , state planners and corporate enterprises often externalized the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biodiversity of their territories as something that they could take care of later , perhaps much later , after they had achieved material prosperity .\nLater has come .\nChina , Japan , South Korea and Taiwan have all reached upper-middle or even high-income status , and the pollution and environmental degradation have become so intense that they threaten the health and livelihood of residents in urban as well as rural areas .\nCitizens across the region no longer automatically prioritize additional material wealth over cleaner air , water , and soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan in the 1960s , and spreading to Taiwan and Korea in the 1980s and China in the 1990s , citizens and civil society groups began to demand that their governments shift priorities away from growth-at-any-cost .\nThe governments were slow to take notice at first , but by the 1970s in Japan , the 1990s in Korea and Taiwan , and after 1998 in China , East Asia \u2019 s states began to modify their emphasis on growth to incorporate environmental restoration and preservation into their policies and practices .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental change in the nature of these states\u2014from purely developmental to what we call eco-developmental\u2014which recognize that greater environmental sustainability is critical for them to continue to grow economically while maintaining their domestic political legitimacy and assert international leadership .\nEast Asia \u2019 s eco-developmental states have thus committed themselves to some sort of balance between economic development and environmental sustainability .\nCommitment of course does not equal results , and the actual record of the four East Asian states has been mixed .\nChina in particular continues to increase its greenhouse gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this growth partly by building massive , environmentally destructive hydroelectric dams .\nIt also exports environmental degradation by building power plants and hydroelectric dams in many Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) countries .\nJapan , Korea , and Taiwan also export environmental degradation by continuing to import massive amounts of fossil fuels and wood .\nBut all four states have made immense progress in curtailing air pollution and deforestation , and are actively addressing a multitude of other environmental problems .\nPart of the four states \u2019 turn to eco-developmentalism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimes , civil society groups have continued and frequently expanded their environmental action , sometimes in active opposition to and sometimes in wary or even enthusiastic cooperation with state environmental agencies .\nIn addition , the desire to be seen around the globe as environmentally responsible has also accelerated the turn toward eco-developmentalism .\nDespite its prominence in the world economy and the relative wealth of the four countries included in our analysis , East Asia is resource poor .\nJapan and Taiwan both import 93 % of their energy , and Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smaller percentage of its total primary energy\u2014around 16 % \u2014the total volume of imports\u2014270 million tons of coal ( Reuters 2018 ) and 3.06 billion barrels of crude oil ( MAREX 2018 ) in 2017\u2014still makes China the world \u2019 s largest total net energy importer ( IEA 2017 : 60-69 ) .\nEast Asia \u2019 s fossil-fuel thirst thus contributes to environmental degradation and economic imbalance in oil- and gas-producing countries .\nAll four countries also import a large percentage of the wood they use in construction and manufacturing , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taiwan to restore the forest cover lost before and during the early days of the developmental state and allowed China to increase its forest cover from 8-11 % in 1960 to over 21 % today ( Robbins and Harrell 2014 ) .\nThe result is that all the East Asian countries , along with other high-consuming countries like the United States , are causing deforestation abroad\u2014their construction and furniture industries have depleted the forests of Indonesia , Malaysia , the Solomon Islands , and particularly the Russian Far East , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabon in west-central Africa ( ibid. )\n.\nFinally , food imports , especially China \u2019 s enormous appetite for soybeans from Brazil and Argentina ( Rapoza 2015 ; Gu and Thukral 2018 ) , have contributed to deforestation and land degradation in those areas as well .\nAll four countries \u2019 enthusiasm for seafood has put pressure on world marine fisheries resources , threatening biodiversity ( Cao et al .\n2017 ) .\nThe East Asian region also accounted ( in 2012 ) for 48 % of the world \u2019 s manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major reason for its polluted cities and rivers and its high GHG emissions .\nIn 2017-18 China , Japan , Korea , and Taiwan accounted for 51 % , 6 % , 4 % , and 1.5 % of the world \u2019 s steel production ( World Steel Association 2018 , 2019 ) , and all four ranked among the top 10 net exporters of steel , meaning that the toxic effects of coal burning on the air and of steel manufacture on the soil and water resources are concentrated locally .\nSimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Korea , which respectively account for 10 % and 4 % of autos produced worldwide ( OICA n.d. ) 4 , and 12.6 % and 5.2 % of automobile exports ranked by monetary value , ranking second and sixth in the world ( Workman 2019 ) .\nOther manufactures such as leather goods , textiles , machine parts , and electronics , all of which are major East Asian exports , also contribute to the region \u2019 s high rate of pollution from producing goods that will be consumed abroad .\nBecause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and their rapid economic growth in the postwar era , all the East Asian countries except Taiwan have become important participants in international forums dealing with the environment .\nChina , Japan and Korea have participated at least since the initial United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 ( UN 1972 ) and although China participated only in very limited ways during the Maoist era of planned economy and self-reliance from 1949 to 79 , it began to take an active role starting from the 1992 Rio Meeting on Environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active participant since .\nEast Asian countries \u2019 international connections work in two ways .\nIn some cases , the desire for international recognition and integration has led these countries to adopt more progressive policies on the environment .\nIn other cases , as their economic and political influence grows , East Asian countries have been able to influence international dialogues on the environment in their desired directions .\nOn the specific issue of climate change , China \u2019 s position has shifted from its initial insistence in the 1990s that economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its more recent proactive involvement with international efforts to decrease GHG emissions .\nChina \u2019 s commitment to reduce its own GHG emissions has also been a big force in driving down the global cost of wind and solar power generation , thus contributing to rising use of renewable energy across the globe .\nChina has also become a leader in endangered species conservation , having cooperated with international conservation NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy ( Litzinger 2004 ; Moseley and Mullin 2014 ) and the World Wide Fund for Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In particular , China has gained international respect for its efforts toward the restoration of the iconic megafaunal species Ailuropoda melanoleuca ( Giant Panda ) which has become a national symbol as well as an object of environmental concern ( Songster 2018 ) .\nIn addition to the renewable energy sector , Japan and Korea ( and to a lesser extent Taiwan ) have focused on helping manufacturing firms adjust their products and processes to be more eco-friendly .\nJust as Japan was the first East Asian developmental state , it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incorporate environmental priorities into its co-development plans with manufacturers .\nFor example , its investments in high-efficiency and electric vehicles paid off in a big way with the explosive popularity of the Toyota Prius .\nThat model sold 300 vehicles during its launch year in 1997 , and twenty years later , in 2017 , more than 1.5 million Priuses were sold globally , and the total electric vehicle market worldwide had risen to almost 12 million vehicles , representing a reduction of 90 million tons of CO2 ( Toyota 2018 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world \u2019 s electric cars on its roads ( IEA 2020 ) .\nIn the construction industry , Japan \u2019 s policies to encourage waste reduction and recycling also offer important models that other countries follow ; Japan now has a 100 % recycling rate for industrial concrete ( Tam 2009 ) , and China has recently reduced the energy used in producing a ton of cement by about a third of what it was just a few years ago ( Li et al .\n2017 : 1841 ) .\nAlthough they followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , South Korea and Taiwan have also developed extensive green growth initiatives .\nSouth Korea \u2019 s 2009 National Strategy for Green Growth , with its associated Five-Year Plan , was perhaps the most comprehensive in the region , articulating clear goals for resource conservation and emissions reduction , as well as significant public and private investment in green technology ( UN n.d. ) .\nSimilarly , Taiwan has found that nurturing \u201c green \u201d industrial products and related services promotes economic growth and helps mitigate the economic effect of the decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 ; Hu et al .\n2017 ) .\nIn Japan , Korea , and Taiwan interactions between state and civil society show important interplays with global environmental organizations and agendas .\nThe governments of Japan and Korea were initially reluctant to sign international protocols on labeling of genetically modified organisms , but pressures from civil society groups that were linked to international environmental organizations led both countries to ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety .\nWhile sometimes at odds with those advocating for CO2 reductions , anti-nuclear activists in Japan , Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies across the region .\nEast Asia as a Region in Environment and Environmental Politics A skeptic might question the value of discussing the environmental policies of China , Japan , South Korea and Taiwan together , since they have such different political systems and political cultures .\nWe believe , however , that there are three strong reasons for writing about East Asia as a region .\nFirst , despite their obvious differences , East Asian countries have a number of historical , cultural , political , economic , and ecological similarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the countries in the region are highly connected to one another and have been for centuries .\nThose interconnections tend to be obscured in country-specific analyses , underscoring the value of comparative scholarship covering the entire region .\nFinally , given the similarities among them and the close connections between them , the differences among the countries allow for valuable controlled comparison of their environments along with their environmental cultures and politics .\nFirst and foremost , East Asia is a climatic and ecological region that shares air , water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is affected by the geologic fault lines that separate the Asian continent from North America , the Pacific Ocean , and the Philippines .\nThe region shares a typhoon season , heightening its collective exposure to climate change-related risks .\nDust from storms originating in the Loess Plateau of North China and the Inner Mongolian desert to the north is a major contributor to lowering air quality in Korea and Japan , and on certain days can even be detected in Seattle and San Francisco .\nSimilarly , East Asia \u2019 s economies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner for Japan , Korea , and Taiwan ; and those three countries represent China \u2019 s # 2 , # 3 , and # 4 trading partners after the United States .\nJust as European and American-owned manufacturing companies exported their air and water pollution to more permissive regulatory regimes in Japan , then to Korea and Taiwan , those countries are now exporting their pollution ( and also many of their manufacturing jobs ) to the low wage labor and looser regulatory regime of China .\nMuch of Taiwanese-owned manufacturing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now takes place in China , along with substantial amounts of Japanese- and Korean-owned manufacturing .\nThese activities of course not only boost incomes but affect China \u2019 s environment in negative ways , primarily through pollution ( Hatch and Yamamura 1996 ; Reardon-Anderson 1997 ; Terao and Otsuka 2007 ; Wilkening 2004 ; Lora-Wainwright 2017 ) .\nAir current flows mean that the pollution produced by these companies then drifts back to their home countries .\nThus , unlike when the US and Europe outsourced their polluting industry to Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taiwan to China does not entirely outsource the related pollution .\nRelatedly , when Japan , Korea and Taiwan invest in cleaner supply chains , greener technology , and transportation methods for their sub-contractors in China , it can contribute to the improvement in the quality of their own air , water , soil , and marine resources .\nHistorically , the eastern half of China , along with all of the Korean Peninsula , Taiwan , and Japan south of Hokkaido , has maintained an unusually high population density for multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which large numbers of peasant farmers grow grains intensively and pay rents and taxes to a landlord elite and to a centralized state staffed by members of this elite .\nMany of the specific problems of East Asia \u2019 s environment , including pollution , deforestation , and species loss\u2014are related to the high population density recently compounded in its effects by rapid economic growth and urbanization .\nEast Asian countries also share both elite and popular cultural ideas about human-environment relations .\nThe elite cultures of East Asia were dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Confucian , \u201d which expresses diverse views that have been drawn on by political leaders to promote different agendas at different times .\nDuring China \u2019 s imperial era and Mao \u2019 s rule , the perspective that nature exists to serve humanity , and thus human action can prevail over or control nature , was promoted .\nThis attitude was exemplified by the slogan \u201c humans are destined to triumph over nature \u201d ( ren ding sheng tian ) , which can be found on a seaside monument to engineering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in Maoist propaganda from 1960s and 1970s China ( Shapiro 2001 , Weller 2006 ) .\nMore recently , pro-environmental leaders and activists in all four countries have touted another aspect of the Confucian tradition , one that promotes harmony or even unity between humans and nature .\nThis idea is embodied in the slogan \u201c unity of nature and people \u201d ( tian ren heyi ) , which has evolved in China into the modern cry to build an \u201c ecological civilization \u201d ( shengtai wenming ; Schmitt 2016 ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notions of village ecology and balance , such as the Japanese \u201c village and mountain \u201d ( satoyama ) , stress the ecological integrity of the agrarian community ( Takeuchi et al , 2002 ) .\nInterestingly , the interconnection between humans and nature , and the emperor \u2019 s historic responsibility for maintaining harmony in both , meant that in contrast to the Christian view of natural disasters as \u201c acts of God \u201d for which leaders were not responsible , natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes were seen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mandate of Heaven , and should perhaps be replaced .\nThus , leaders across East Asia , even those not subject to democratic political pressures , have felt a responsibility to address environmental pollution and environmental disasters that threaten people \u2019 s \u201c right to subsistence \u201d ( Tu 1989 ; Perry 2008 ) .\nAlthough they operate in a widely diverse set of political regimes , environmental advocates across the region rely on a remarkably similar set of strategies to influence policy and state action .\nEverywhere , more organizations use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education as their primary advocacy strategies than use more direct forms of action such as public protest , lobbying , and litigation .\nWhom you know has always been more important than what you know in East Asian societies ( and elsewhere ) , and this general cultural trend is reflected in the strategies utilized by environmental activists in the region .\nAdditionally , East Asian nations all lack a tradition of citizen participation in governance above the very local level .\nThus , across the region mechanisms of citizen participation through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence national legislatures or bureaucracies are relatively new and tend to be underdeveloped , even among the democratic states .\nAt the same time , all the countries have strong traditions of local governance .\nAlso , perhaps significantly , the region has a long and diverse tradition of millenarian rebellions and other popular movements based on religious or other local solidarities ( Perry and Harrell 1983 ) .\nThis paradox\u2014high levels of civic engagement at the local level and low levels of activism at the national level\u2014contributes to many of the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the region .\nFinally , since World War II , the East Asian states have all shared the consensus of the developmental state , a governing body that derives its legitimacy from its ability to improve material consumption among its citizens .\nThe developmental state \u2019 s initial bargain\u2014asking citizens to accept environmental degradation in return for an increased standard of consumption\u2014began to fray as economic prosperity increased and environmental conditions deteriorated , leading to the formation of the eco-developmental state as a new basis for policy and state legitimacy .\nAlthough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among East Asian countries also make the region productive for academic inquiry .\nPrecisely because a regional focus allows scholars to control for the many historical , ecological , economic , and cultural variables that the countries have in common , it becomes possible to engage in a detailed investigation into the ways that biophysical , sociocultural , administrative , legal , and geopolitical differences affect political behavior .\nPerhaps most obviously , there are large biophysical differences among the countries .\nBecause of China \u2019 s continental size and location , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taiwan , there are large differences in resource self-sufficiency : Although China has the largest trade volume of any nation , because of its size it is much more self-sufficient and less dependent on trade than its smaller neighbors .\nIt produces more of its own energy , forest resources , and even food than the other nations , and this difference affects the ability of each country to determine its environmental policies , particularly with respect to energy .\nWe can see this especially with respect to nuclear power politics .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear power , getting as much as 30 percent of its electricity from that source before the 2011 Fukushima triple disaster ( World Nuclear Association 2019 ) , and since then has emphasized conservation .\nKorea generated 29 % of its electricity from nuclear plants in 2017 , but the Moon administration has announced plans to gradually eliminate nuclear generation as a power source ( World Nuclear News 2017 ) .\nTaiwan built three nuclear plants during the period of authoritarian rule , but popular protests have rendered a fourth plant infeasible since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to a fast transition to heavy reliance on renewables , though the means for achieving that goal are only vaguely defined .\nNuclear power remains a difficult political issue for all of the countries in the region , and its future has not yet been determined .\nSocioculturally , the differences among the countries are quite complex .\nMany of them stem from the recent historical trajectories of governance models : Japan as a bureaucratic state with democratic elections throughout the postwar era , Korea and Taiwan with traditions of authoritarian governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century , and China as an authoritarian state that nevertheless changed its economic model from state socialism to bureaucratic capitalism after 1980 .\nThese differences influence the nature of regulatory regimes , ministerial turf wars , and most importantly environmentalist opposition to and cooperation with state agencies in the four countries .\nThe strength and character of democratic politics\u2014its institutions , ( e.g.\n, elected legislature , free press , independent judiciary , and autonomous advocacy organizations ) , as well as its practices ( e.g.\n, electoral politics , public protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014are commonly thought to be critical for determining the environmental politics of a country .\nEast Asia allows us to examine that assumption : although all four countries have very different experiences with democracy , they all initially followed a developmental state model and have made the transition to eco-developmental states .\nCentral-local government relations also differ .\nAll four countries have strong central governments and a common practice of local policy experimentation prior to national policy implementation .\nHowever , the center-local political game is played very differently in the four places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies as well .\nIn China , localities can practice what we might call \u201c guided autonomy \u201d or a limited ability to experiment with policy implementation , so that policies such as the emissions trading markets or renewable energy subsides are often tried out locally before being implemented on a wider scale .\nIn Japan local municipalities frequently experiment with waste , emissions , and building ordinances in an effort to increase the quality of their local environment .\nWhen those local models are effective , they can be adopted by multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , in Taiwan local governments are able to experiment with environmental policies , and their models of what to do as well as what not to do can be adopted nationally .\nIn Japan and Taiwan , pioneering local governments often \u201c guide \u201d the national governments in the area of environmental policy .\nAlthough Korea has also seen a rise in the level of autonomy of its local governments in recent years , they remain highly constrained and have the least capacity to act as environmental policy innovators of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law and lawyers also varies .\nIn none of these countries has litigation traditionally played as great a role in society as in the Euro-American world , and its importance differs considerably from one country to another .\nAlthough environmental lawsuits have been permitted in China and Taiwan since the early aughts ( Economy 2005 ; Li Jianliang 2010 ) , they play a minor role in comparison to popular protest .\nIn contrast , in both Japan and Korea lawyers and lawsuits have played vital roles in the environmental movement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 1970s by pollution victims , in what came to be known as Japan \u2019 s Big lawsuits ( Upham 2009 ) , served as a critical turning point for the re-orientation of the developmental state away from growth-first towards a model that promoted more sustainable development .\nIn Korea , lawyers \u2019 associations were crucial players in the successful democratization movement ( Lee et al .\n1999 ; Ku 2002 ) , and they continue to influence the evolution of Korea \u2019 s eco-developmental state ( Cho 1999 ) .\nThese differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their participation in rights-based international forums and join various treaties and protocols .\nDiachronic differences are also important to any comparative project , and especially here as we seek to highlight the transformation of developmental to eco-developmental states across the region .\nCountries that experienced this transition at later dates have done so in a different world context , particularly with regard to climate change and its effects .\nJapan , which was the first East Asian country to industrialize , and the first to face the negative environmental legacy of the developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing environmental policies , based primarily on regulation .\nBut it was not until the end of the 20thcentury that the bureaucratic processes of regulation became transparent enough , and global environmental NGOs became powerful enough , to allow popular participation to influence policy significantly .\nKorea and Taiwan not only developed later , they democratized later .\nIt is partly because of this timing that they have been much more closely connected to worldwide environmental movements .\nChina has not democratized , but is eager to be seen as a player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of top-down environmental regulation that also allows a small amount of popular environmental protest ( Lora-Wainwright 2017 ) , but activism has generally been restricted to the local level ( Ho 2007 , Teets 2014 ) .\nAll of these differences mean that the basic dynamics and priorities in the environmental politics in the four countries vary widely .\nWhile there are remarkable similarities in the specific strategies utilized by citizens to advocate for pro-environmental policy change , the configuration of environmental politics in the four places is very different .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis first and has been ruled by the Liberal Democratic Party for nearly all of the post-war period , environmental organizations have been most effective when they have found allies among the ruling LDP members and inside the bureaucracy and local government .\nWhile advocacy organizations have connections to opposition parties , electoral politics has not been a defining element of the environmental movement .\nIn contrast , in South Korea and Taiwan , the environmental movement became fully incorporated into those countries \u2019 pro-democracy movements , creating much closer connections between environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ; Lee 2000 ; Lyons 2009 ; Grano 2015 ; Haddad 2015a ) .\nIn further contrast , after a brief period of opening up in the 2000s , the CCP has spent much of the last decade tightening state control over environmental organizations and increasing party involvement in their activities .\nAs a result , environmental groups in China tend to be small and local , and if they grow larger , they must find ways to work productively with the government or face shutdown .\nIn sum , East Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the complex dynamics of environmental politics and particularly the way that developmental states can evolve into eco-developmental states .\nThe four countries in the region whose experiences are highlighted here share many ecological , social , cultural , and political characteristics , but they vary in size , resource wealth , history , and especially political systems .\nThis enables us to study in detail how these various factors can influence environmental politics and how national policy can become reshaped by environmental advocacy .\nBecause of their geographic proximity and cultural commonalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in size and regime type , the East Asian countries have all experienced a similar trajectory in the politics and policies of the environment\u2014and in the state of the environment itself\u2014since World War II , but at different times and at different speeds , roughly corresponding to the timing of industrial growth .\nAs a result , East Asian countries have followed a similar pattern where growth-first developmental states have evolved into eco-developmental states , modifying high-growth policies to include pro-environmental goals and promote more sustainable economic growth .\nFirst in Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recently in China , all of the East Asian states supported rapid industrialization and high-speed economic growth that emphasized export-oriented manufacturing industries .\nAs they became economically successful , they also caused environmental catastrophes such as mercury poisoning in Minamata , wintertime PM2.5 \u201c air-pocalypses \u201d in Chinese cities , toxic waste spills in South Korea , and the contamination of indigenous lands by nuclear waste facilities in Taiwan .\nIndustrial pollution endangered the lives and livelihoods of their citizens , threatening the stability of their political regimes .\nAll of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new environmental concerns into their governance strategies .\nJapan \u2019 s Liberal Democratic Party managed to hold onto power by passing sweeping environmental regulations in 1970 during what came to be known as \u201c the pollution Diet.\n\u201d The military/nationalist regimes in South Korea and Taiwan failed to get ahead of popular dissatisfaction\u2014the environmental movements merged with pro-democracy movements that resulted in political democratization in the late 1980s in both places .\nSo far , the Chinese Communist Party has managed to keep ahead of the mounting political pressure with increasingly ambitious pro-environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to political unrest .\nThis process of transformation from a developmental state to an eco-developmental state was a gradual one that proceeded in fits and starts over many decades .\nBeginning with the influential work of political scientist Chalmers Johnson on Japan ( 1982 ) , which he ( Johnson 1986 , 1999 ) and others later extended to Taiwan ( Gold 1986 ) and Korea ( Haggard and Moon 1997 ; Suh and Kwon 2014 ) , the idea of the developmental state has been central to analysis of East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , Korea , and Taiwan have been characterized by private ownership of most of the means of production ; policies set and enforced by a meritocratically selected bureaucracy ; and active intervention , through both regulation ( including import substitution followed by export promotion ) and economic incentives , to guide economic growth in the directions it deems desirable .\nIn service of their development goals , these states have promoted universal education , including both technical and nationalistic content ; ensured relative income equality ; and limited citizen political participation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , having had a planned economy from the 1950s to the early 1980s , gradually \u201c grew out of the plan \u201d and came to resemble the other East Asian developmental states more closely , though state ownership still accounts for a larger share of its economy ( Naughton 2015 ) .\nAcross all four countries , governments and businesses clung tenaciously to their pro-growth , anti-environment developmental models until their citizens , whose lives and livelihoods were threatened by industrial pollution , demanded change .\nJapan \u2019 s postwar environmental movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban air quality and by a series of industrial pollution incidents ( Avenell 2012 : 27 ) , two of which have become iconic in the world history of environmentalism .\nIn one incident , the Mitsui Company \u2019 s mines polluted the waters of the Jinzu River in Toyama Prefecture with cadmium , causing the outbreak of a local epidemic of itai-itai ( Ouch !\n, Ouch ! )\ndisease , which led first to local citizen protests and eventually to litigation in which Mitsui was found culpable and forced both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large amount of compensation ( Yoshida et al .\n1999 ) .\nIn the other incident , the Chisso Corporation , a plastics manufacturer in Kyushu , released large amounts of methyl mercury into Minamata Bay , and local people ingesting fish became afflicted with what came to be known as Minamata disease , a potentially fatal degenerative disease of the nervous system .\nThis led to local protests and eventually to the formation of a national environmental movement with important political allies ( Almeida and Stearns 1998 ) , one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nature preservation and food safety in addition to opposing industrial pollution and its negative health effects ( Avenell 2012 : 429 ) .\nIn Korea , the rise of an environmental movement followed its own rapid industrialization , about two decades after Japan \u2019 s .\nThere were local protests as early as the 1960s and 70s , in response to pollution around industrial sites and local demands for contamination .\nJust as pollution in Minamata galvanized the Japanese , Korean farmers demanding compensation for pollution caused by the Ulsan Industrial Complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of Seoul and Inch \u2019 on affected by poor air quality .\nCitizens began to establish organizations to pressure the government and demand change ( Ku 2002 ; Lee 2000 ) .\nBut in the atmosphere of a repressive military dictatorship that lasted until 1987 , only local action was possible , and the regime blocked attempts at coordination between local residents of polluted areas and any national or international environmental organizations , seeing them ( correctly ) as connected with the pro-democracy movement and hostile to the dictatorship ( Ku 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doo-hwan dictatorship fell in 1987 , the space for political organizing around the environment expanded , and during the 1990s Korea \u2019 s environmental movement grew rapidly , as part of the growth of civil society organizations generally in the newly democratic country .\nNow , the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement ( KFEM ) , which was formed in 1993 by the merger of eight national environmental groups , is the largest environmental organization in East Asia by far , boasting more than 80,000 members ( Deep Sea n.d. ) .\nTaiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time as Korea \u2019 s , but in different ways .\nLike its counterparts in Korea , the Nationalist-ruled state ignored environmental concerns in its headlong ( and successful ) push for development , setting the stage for environmental opposition .\nThis opposition began , as did environmental movements in Japan and Korea , around local issues , primarily those of water pollution .\nFor Taiwan , the pollution cases that served to spark the national movement were those formed against Sunko Ink in Taichung County ( 1982-1984 ) and DuPont in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw local villagers organize and successfully force companies to scrap plans to locate factories in their towns ( Ho 2010 ) .\nThroughout the 1980s victims as well as opposition intellectuals began to raise issues of local water and air pollution along with nuclear power and nuclear waste , the latter prompted by the 1980 proposal to build Taiwan \u2019 s fourth nuclear power plant .\nThis nascent environmental movement was a primary issue in the programs of the \u201c Outside the Party ( Dangwai ) \u201d political movement that developed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it formed in defiance of a ban on the founding of opposition parties in 1986 and was allowed to organize and run candidates when martial law was lifted in 1987 .\nAfter full democratization in the late 1990s , the environmental movement , among many other social movements , began to resort to mass demonstrations on the one hand , and to formal organizations on the other , becoming , as Ho ( 2011:120 ) puts it \u201c a vital component of political life.\n\u201d Unlike Korea but like Hokkaido and Okinawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant indigenous population , which was deprived of much of its rights to land and resources by the Japanese colonial government and then by the Nationalist dictatorship after 1945 .\nAs civil society organizations of all kinds blossomed beginning in the late 1980s , the Aboriginal Rights Movement grew along with them .\nBecause of both resource extraction and the storage of nuclear waste on aboriginal lands after 1979 , indigenous rights and environmental rights became closely connected political issues in Taiwan , and have remained so to the present day .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economic development , has taken place most recently .\nPropelled by the Marxist assurance that only capitalism could despoil the environment , along with the ideological valorization of sacrifice for the revolution , the Communist-ruled state paid little attention to environmental concerns even after the transition in the 1980s to a bureaucratic capitalist system in which state agencies , along with private capital , are important industrial and market actors .\nInformed by what happened in the other countries as pollution intensified \u2014especially how the environmental movement provided significant support to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Taiwan\u2014the CCP sought to model its response on the LDP , which was able to stay in power by enacting ambitious , far-reaching legislation protecting the environment .\nIn December 1989 ( a mere six months after crushing pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square ) China enacted a new Environmental Protection Law , which was quickly followed by additional laws focused on limiting air , water , and solid waste pollution ( Xie 2020 ) .\nThe first officially-permitted environmental NGO in China , Friends of Nature ( Ziran Zhi You ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on issues of biodiversity conservation and nature education rather than anti-pollution advocacy ( Weller 2006 : 128-29 ) .\nThe Chinese state is notoriously fearful of any kind of independent national-scale organization or movement , environmental or otherwise .\nThe primary focus of environmental organization and protest ( as with other forms of protest ) , therefore , has always been local .\nAd hoc , grass-roots organizations formed to address issues of industrial pollution and its effects on agriculture , food safety , water quality , and population health ( Lora-Wainwright 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAlthough China , like Taiwan , has large indigenous minority populations , indigenous peoples have not been allowed to organize for environmental causes , lest their organizations develop into movements for local autonomy .\nWhen national-scale environmentalism emerged after 1998 , it was thus inevitably incorporated into the state \u2019 s developmentalist system , and belongs to the next section of our overall history\u2014the evolution of the eco-developmental state .\nThe Evolution of the Eco-Developmental State Nowhere in East Asia did the state respond quickly to the environmental concerns brought up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing public awareness .\nInstead , all of the states , attempting to continue their policies of promoting economic development through collaboration with industrial corporations and enterprises , initially reacted by trying to ignore and minimize the problems .\nThe states claimed that pollution was a temporary sacrifice that populations would have to endure if people wanted to continue to raise their standards of consumption , and by studying environmental problems without doing anything concrete about them ( Avenell 2012 : 434-35 ) .\nEventually , however , spurred on by a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements and realization that things were getting bad enough to harm further development , governments began to act to address environmental problems , reaching environmental tipping points .\nJapan , having been first to pollute , was also first to begin cleaning up , but it did not really begin until the late 1960s and early 1970s , initially at the local level and then only later at the national level .\nAt that time , the Japanese developmental state began to become eco-developmental\u2014passing anti-pollution laws , creating an environmental protection agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had brought lawsuits in the courts ( Avenell 2012 : 435 , Chapter 5 ; Wakamatsu et al .\n2013 ) .\nWithin only a few decades , Japan went from being a \u201c toxic archipelago \u201d ( Walker 2011 ) to one that enjoyed some of the cleanest air , water , and soil among advanced capitalist countries as the government implemented regulations and corporate actors saw the commercial value of cleaner , more efficient production processes and products ( Schreurs 2002 ) .\nIn spite of this dramatic improvement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals and policies with environmental ones .\nThe Japanese state still prioritizes economic growth , although it now takes environmental concerns into account when it considers how to support that growth .\nAs a result , international and national NGOs , local citizen groups , environmental lawyers , and other activists continue to put pressure on the state and large corporations to live up to their environmental promises ( Edahiro 2009 ) .\nIn Korea , the Chun Doo-hwan regime ( 1980-88 ) actively worked to suppress the environmental movement .\nFor example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onsan disease \u201d caused by heavy metal pollution in Gyeongsamnan-do , the government \u2019 s environmental agency ( falsely ) announced that the disease was not caused by industrial pollution ( Ku 2004 : 196 ) .\nAfter democratization , however , the state reaction to environmental concerns began to evolve .\nPresident Roh Tae-woo condemned the Doosan Electrical Materials company for spilling phenols into the Nakdong River in 1991 .\nThat same year local residents and national NGOs organized to block a proposed dam on the Donggang River , and won their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dae-Jung announced that plans to build the dam had been scrapped .\nThat same day he laid out \u201c The New Millennium Vision for the Environment \u201d in 2000 ( ibid .\n: 199-201 ) .\nSince that time Korea \u2019 s state regulation has been successful in combating air pollution and partially successful in combating water pollution .\nAs in Korea , Taiwan \u2019 s environmental movement played a key role in democratization itself ( Weller 1999 ) , and its political system rather quickly evolved into a \u201c two-camp \u201d structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two major parties\u2014the reformed Nationalist Party leading the so-called \u201c blue \u201d camp and the Democratic Progressive Party leading the \u201c green , \u201d both named for the colors of the respective parties \u2019 flags and not for any affiliation with environmental movements .\nWhile Korea \u2019 s environmentalists formed a powerful organization in the Korean Federation of Environmental Movements ( KFEM ) that usually supported the Democratic Party , in Taiwan environmentalists formed an independent Green Party .\nTaiwan \u2019 s Green Party has never gained representation in the national legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and county councils and work with the Democratic Progressive Party to run and support candidates for national office .\nThrough their partnership with the Democratic Progressive Party they have promoted such programs as \u201c trash doesn \u2019 t fall to the ground ( lese bu luo di ) \u201d under then-Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian ( which was partly responsible for his successful bid for the presidency in the 2000 elections , ending fifty-plus years of Nationalist party rule ) .\nSignificant air and water quality regulations were adopted during his mayoral and presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trajectory to the others , but for very different reasons and with starkly contrasting outcomes .\nAll through the transition from state socialism to bureaucratic capitalism in the 1980s and early 1990s , China \u2019 s environmental degradation accelerated .\nThroughout this period , it continued to be impossible for any but the most local and spontaneous groups to engage in protest , let alone organize effectively in opposition .\nThus , unlike the other three places , China has not seen any coordinated environmental or anti-nuclear movements emerge to play a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation in state policy orientation did happen , beginning in the mid-1990s and galvanized by disastrous floods in the middle-Yangzi provinces in 1998 that killed more than 3,000 people , left 15 million homeless , and negatively affected more than 200 million people ( UN 1998 ) .\nAfter researching the cause of the floods , state scientists ( wrongly perhaps : see Henck et al .\n2011 ) attributed much of the damage to upstream deforestation caused by the logging booms of the late 1950s , 1970s and 1980s .\nThe state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to take environmental regulation seriously .\nThe State Environmental Protection Administration ( later elevated to ministry status ) began aggressive campaigns to stop deforestation , followed after a few years by policies emphasizing de-carbonization of the nation \u2019 s energy mix , as well as attempts to address excessive water use for irrigation ( which had caused the Yellow River , for example , to run dry before it reached the ocean in the winter during the 1990s ) , and measures to clean up some of the world \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of China \u2019 s recent push to green its coal-based energy sector though efficiency and renewables has been driven by green industrial policy , in line with overarching economic development and reform goals ( Lewis 2013 ) .\nUnlike the eco-developmental states in Japan , Korea , and Taiwan , however , there has been little coordination between any central-level state agencies and national environmental groups , because there are no powerful national environmental groups .\nFormally organized local groups do exist from time to time , and local protests continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lora-Wainwright 2017 ) .\nLocal state agencies are often eager to compromise and to pay compensation to victims of pollution or occasionally to shut down the most egregious polluters , in fear of retribution from higher-level state agencies .\nAt the national level , a small number of the largest and most professional global NGOs such as The Nature Conservancy ( n.d. ) and the Natural Resources Defense Council ( 2016 ) have been able to work with the Chinese government to promote better environmental policies .\nBut unlike the other countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between opposition and collaboration of state branches and environmental organizations , except in the area of species conservation .\nInstead , environmental mitigation in China has been largely state-led , using methods ranging from legislation to broad policy initiatives , including the state \u2019 s proclamation that China is an \u201c ecological civilization \u201d ( shengtai wenming ) ( Schmitt 2016 ) .\nNot all of these efforts have achieved immediate success\u2014river and lake eutrophication , for example , are still huge problems ( Fu 2020 ) , but the campaign against air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 2010s has been a notable success\u2014sulfur dioxide has been eliminated as a major pollutant ( Li et al .\n2020 ; MEE n.d. ) , and ultra-small particulate pollution has been reduced by more than half in almost all cities ( MEE n.d. ) .5 Renewable energy expansion is well ahead of targets set only a few years ago ( S\u00f6nnichsen 2020 ) , and forest cover continues to expand ( State Forestry 2019 ) .\nIn general , the public and environmental groups have only been able to exercise influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided by the state , which tends to reinforce the legitimacy and authority of the central government while directing the criticism to local authorities ( Haddad 2015c ; Teets 2018 ) .\nWidespread unrest has largely taken a virtual form\u2014videos like Chai Jing \u2019 s \u201c Under the Dome \u201d ( Chai 2015 ) , WeChat and Weibo discussions , and crowd-sourced reporting ( Tyson and Logan 2016 ) of environmental pollution .\nCitizens critical of the government response to environmental problems have not been allowed to form organizations to express that unhappiness\u2014Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if they want to organize , they must form groups that work with , not against , the government .\nSince China \u2019 s transformation to an eco-developmental state is only about a decade old , we have not yet seen the kind of dramatic improvements in air , water , and soil quality that Japan , Korea , and Taiwan have enjoyed .\nIn general , the environmental situation in China remains in \u201c crisis \u201d mode .\nThat said , we note considerable progress in some areas ( e.g.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increase in forest cover ) even as the overall situation remains dire .\nWhile the overall story of the environmental cleanup made possible by the transition from a developmental to an eco-developmental state may be significant , we must emphasize that in no case has the state become a fully environmental state committed to sustainability at the expense of growth .\nThe eco-developmental state views green technology as an important industry for continued economic growth and is concerned about the costs and risks related to climate change and pollution clean-up .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s shift in perspective is not from one that was pro-economic growth to one that is pro-environment .\nRather , the eco-developmental state now recognizes that many pro-environmental policies are also beneficial for the economy , and that sustainable economic growth requires more sustainable environmental policies and practices .\nBecause the eco-developmental state is still very strongly pro-growth , all of these states continue to face both environmental challenges and significant , even growing pressure from their citizens to respond to those challenges .\nOverall , the observed pattern of evolution from developmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main factors : industry support , state capacity , and party incentive .\n\u2022 Industry support .\nIn many cases , pro-environmental policy has the potential to generate economic growth and job creation ( e.g.\n, renewable energy industries or increased energy efficiency ) , and in fact the success of these industries and initiatives has very much been driven by \u201c green \u2019 industrial policy .\nIn other cases , there are real tradeoffs to be made between environmental protection and direct economic gain ( e.g.\n, land conservation or pollution control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state support has remained lukewarm .\n\u2022 State capacity .\nIn industries and issues where the industry is fairly consolidated and/or the state has a lot of influence , it has been a lot easier to shift policies ( e.g.\n, energy , forestry ) .\nIn industries and issues where the sources of pollution are more diffuse ( e.g.\n, car emissions ) or the industry is more fragmented ( e.g.\n, farming ) , it has been a lot harder for the state to convince industry to change behavior .\n\u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negatively affecting an important political constituency , then the ruling party will deal with the issue in order to maintain political legitimacy/support .\nIf the issues are not very visible or affect politically marginalized communities , then the ruling party will be much less likely to deal with the issue .\nWhen these three factors combine , we can observe a wholesale shift away from a growth-at-any-cost policy towards one that regularly includes environmental concerns .\nIndeed , in some policy areas where these three factors coalesce , we see East Asian countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emission and hybrid vehicles in Japan and solar energy in China .\nIn contrast , in areas where we only see a few of these factors coming together ( e.g.\n, biodiversity ) , we see much less inclusion of environmental concerns into state policy .\nThus , the governments of East Asia have remained developmental states even as they incorporate ecological concern within their priorities .\nThey continue to base their legitimacy on their ability to bring material prosperity to their people .\nThey continue to work closely with industry to coordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the spheres where the state can work with industry to promote green growth policies , where efficiency and conservation can cut production costs , when short term environmental investments can reap long-term economic gains , we see tremendous progress towards a model of sustainable development .\nIn other areas , where it is more difficult for industry and/or government to collaborate for a policy that is good for the bottom line as well as good for the planet , when people , plants , and animals can only win when industry loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region seeking to pressure corporations and governments to make more ecologically positive choices .\nThey frequently lose those fights , but they keep fighting .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists

manipulated the Kashmir dispute in ways which few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to negotiate a de-escalation along both fronts in Kashmir set alight by their brinkmanship .\nIndia \u2019 s military standoff with China in the Ladakh region of Kashmir was never expected to last long , or even escalate into a shooting war .\nBut nobody foresaw the last Thursday of a ceasefire agreement between

snatched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced that their strategy was built upon the element of surprise .\nQuite simply , Pakistan did not believe that India would cross its red lines because of the risk that it could spark an unwinnable war between the nuclear-armed nemeses .\nIslamabad \u2019 s conclusion was justifiable : India \u2019 s military , while significantly bigger , is in no better a

false sense of security and they made one big mistake : they dismissed Modi \u2019 s pre-2014 election rhetoric as mere words .\nSo did most people outside of India .\nMeanwhile , Modi and his Hindutva coterie were forging ahead with their plans to put India on the geopolitical map of the world like never before .\nCorrectly , they surmised that Pakistan \u2019 s response to surprise escalations would be defensive , not retaliatory .\nTheir calculations also took into account that Pakistan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only just defeated the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) in the northwestern tribal areas bordering Afghanistan .\nA decisive counterinsurgency operation in the restive Balochistan province was ongoing .\nAnd the civilian government and the military were engaged in a hugely divisive power struggle .\nPlus the 2019 general elections in India were fast approaching and the Modi government \u2019 s approval ratings suggested that his Bharatiya Janata Party would struggle to gain a majority .\nAs soon as the opportunity presented itself , in the form of a suicide bombing that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Indian warplanes to bomb a deactivated militant training camp located inside Pakistan .\nIn doing so , Modi achieved three objectives at the bargain basement price of the rickety MiG-21 Pakistan subsequently shot down , and cringe worthy videos of the

believing that the status quo in Kashmir would hold .\nSo the memes flowed and Pakistan soon switched focus back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , however , Modi & Co had conveyed what India would do if Pakistan were to retaliate in kind : ballistic missiles were in play .\nWithin three years , India \u2019 s military posture had gone from reactionary to retaliatory to punitive to a warhead choice

difficult to overstate the sheer audacity of this geopolitical gamble .\nSomehow , Modi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan a secret , and that , along with the overhanging threat of a response to any Pakistani military retaliation is what shaped Islamabad \u2019 s non-reaction .\nOf course , Modi does not hold all the cards and , like all big-stack bullies , his tactics were only effective until a bigger

as seen through the eyes of key Western diplomats in the 1870s .\nAlthough it played out over seven years , the annexation process unfolded relatively smoothly on the international stage .\nOne reason for this was the skill with which Japanese diplomats handled inquiries and potential protests by Western diplomats .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as 1872 , leading members of the Meiji government were gaining familiarity with the nuances of Western diplomatic maneuvering .\nIndeed , in some ways the annexation functioned as a rehearsal for future diplomatic challenges the regime would face .\nIn retrospect , it offers an excellent lens through which to view Japanese diplomacy of the 1870s.1 Following the restoration of imperial power , Meiji Japan embraced modernization and , as part of this process , it sought to determine its national borders in order to create a modern nation-state .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meiji leaders incorporated the former foreign territory known as \u201c Ezo , \u201d renaming it Hokkaido ; in 1875 , they exchanged the island of Sakhalin with Russia in return for the acquisition of the Kuril Islands ; in the south , in 1876 , they annexed the Bonin Islands through a formal declaration ; and in the same year , they imposed an \u201c unequal treaty \u201d on Korea , employing the same kind of gunboat diplomacy that Commodore Matthew Perry had used against Japan in 1853-54 .\nFinally , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom of the Ryukyus .\nAs previous scholarship has shown , by the early 1870s Japanese diplomats had recognized the interconnected nature of Japan \u2019 s unresolved border issues and the need to devise a comprehensive policy towards them.2Although I fully acknowledge the importance of understanding Meiji Japan \u2019 s national border issues as a single question , in this paper I confine myself to addressing the Ryukyuan annexation to Japan .\nDissatisfied with the Ryukyus \u2019 ambivalent status \u2013 China and Japan both laid claims to the territory \u2013 in the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1879 Tokyo \u2019 s leaders resorted to political and diplomatic maneuvers that aimed to formally incorporate the Ryukyu Kingdom into the newly established Meiji state .\nThey ordered the Ryukyus to dispatch an embassy to Tokyo , where they appointed the ruling monarch as \u201c King of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain \u201d ; sent a punitive mission to Taiwan to avenge the deaths of a group of Ryukyuan fishermen considered to be \u201c Japanese subjects \u201d ; concluded , through British mediation , an international agreement with the Qing court that ( implicitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese ; ordered the kingdom to cease tributary relations with China ; and , finally , in the face of strong resistance from the Ryukyuan authorities , annexed the kingdom by force .\nHistorians have conventionally referred to this process , which culminated in the establishment of Okinawa prefecture in 1879 , as the Ry\u016bky\u016b shobun ( \u201c the disposition of Ryukyu , \u201d 1872-1879 ; hereafter \u201c annexation \u201d ) .3 Gregory Smits has pointed out that during the 1880s , \u201c the shobun became an international event , involving diplomatic activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , the United States , France , and , of course , former officials of the Ry\u016bky\u016ban court.\n\u201d 4 As Smits \u2019 analysis suggests , the Ryukyu islands presented the new Meiji State with a diplomatic conundrum , one that involved not only relations with China , but also its relationship with several Western countries , especially those which had negotiated treaties with the Ryukyus ( \u201c Lew Chew \u201d ) in the 1850s .\nIn other words , the Meiji leaders needed , at the very least , the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the islands.5 This paper focusses on the annexation as seen through the eyes of a number of key Western diplomats during the 1870s .\nHad these diplomats chosen to make a serious issue of Japan \u2019 s annexation of the Ryukyus , the matter could easily have become more complex and international tensions escalated .\nAlthough it played out over seven years , the annexation unfolded relatively smoothly on the international stage .\nOne reason for this was the skill with which Japanese diplomats handled questions and potential protests by Western diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of their inquiries were directed specifically at the Ryukyuan treaties.6 As early as 1872 , leading members of the Meiji government were becoming increasingly adept at interpreting the nuances of Western diplomatic maneuvering.7 Indeed , the annexation of the Ryukyus can be seen as an early example of the future diplomatic challenges the regime would face .\nIn retrospect , the annexation provides an excellent lens through which to view Japanese diplomacy of the 1870s .\nIn 1609 , the Ryukyu Kingdom was defeated by the Satsuma Domain and surrendered unconditionally ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the de facto rule of Satsuma ( and by extension , of the Tokugawa bakufu ) .8 However , the Ryukyus continued to maintain the posture of an independent country , with Satsuma \u2019 s approval and financial support , in order to maintain tributary relations with China.9 In this way , while Satsuma gave the kingdom a high degree of autonomy in its internal affairs , it exercised considerable control over the kingdom \u2019 s foreign relations and created what Smits has called a \u201c theatrical state \u201d in its relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Westerners arrived in East Asia , visiting both the Ryukyus and Japan .\nSubsequently , the United States , France , and Holland concluded treaties of amity with the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1854 , 1855 , and 1859 , respectively .\nIn so doing , these Western nations recognized that the kingdom possessed at least some degree of diplomatic capacity , as the Ryukyuan authorities had signed these various agreements without the direct involvement of Satsuma officials .\nRyukyuan officials drafted the treaties they exchanged with their Western counterparts in classical Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar , omitting any reference to the kingdom \u2019 s subordination to Japan .\nThe Ryukyuan officials who negotiated with these Western powers were exercising the same kind of \u201c theatrical diplomacy \u201d that the Ryukyus had employed for centuries with China .\nWhile they repeatedly emphasized the kingdom \u2019 s status as a tributary of China , they never revealed their subordinate relationship with Satsuma and the bakufu.11 Although the powers \u2019 arrival was perceived as a threat to the kingdom \u2019 s stability , and the Ryukyuan negotiators took great pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the end , they succumbed to the Westerners \u2019 demands .\nIn the 1850s , Western observers were further prevented from fully understanding the Ryukyus \u2019 status by the bakufu \u2019 s ambiguous replies when they asked about its relations with the kingdom .\nWhen , in early 1854 , Commodore Perry demanded that bakufu officials open the port of Naha , the Japanese negotiators replied that \u201c the Ryukyu islands are very distant and the opening of its ports can not be discussed by us.\n\u201d It was following this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty with the Ryukyus without the bakufu \u2019 s involvement.12 On the other hand , the bakufu did not raise any objection to the compacts the Ryukyus signed with the US and France , and when in 1857 the Dutch asked the shogunate to mediate a treaty between Holland and the Ryukyus , the shogunate replied that even though the Ryukyu Kingdom shitagafu ( obeys or submits ) to Japan , moto yori gaikoku no koto nite ( \u201c it has been a foreign kingdom from the beginning \u201d ) , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rulers to give instructions about such a treaty.13 From the bakufu \u2019 s perspective , the Ryukyus were subordinate to Japan , but not part of Japan ; thus , they thought it prudent not to intervene in the Ryukyuan\u2013Dutch Treaty .\nAlthough , at that time , the bakufu did not fully grasp that an international treaty was an agreement signed by two sovereign states and all the ramifications that flowed from that , it still tacitly approved the instruments signed by the Ryukyu Kingdom in the 1850s .\nThe Ryukyuan\u2013American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stipulated that American citizens in the Ryukyus should be treated with courtesy and friendship ; Americans were granted the right of free trade and the ability to move freely on the islands without restriction , as well as the right of extraterritoriality ( but not of consular residence ) ; and that US ships in difficulty should be assisted and treated with courtesy by the Ryukyuan authorities .\nIn the French treaty , in addition to these privileges , the Most Favored Nation clause was also included , along with rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Dutch treaty was similar to the American treaty , but like the French instrument it also included the Most Favored Nation clause .\nIn the original documents , these agreements were referred to variously as \u201c treaties , \u201d \u201c compacts \u201d and \u201c conventions.\n\u201d As the treaties lacked ratification clauses , the rights and relations defined in them were valid and effective immediately following the exchange of the documents between the parties involved.14 However , while the US government ratified its treaty with the kingdom in 1855 ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement ) , the French and Dutch government decided not to ratify their respective treaties with the Ryukyus in the late 1860s .\nLast page of the 1854 Ryukyu-US Treaty Courtesy of the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan ( \u5916\u52d9\u7701\u30fb\u5916\u4ea4\u53f2\u6599\u9928\u8535\uff09 As early as 1862 , the bakufu had revised its former policy and begun to characterize the Ryukyus as subordinate to both China and Japan , while also strongly affirming Satsuma control over the kingdom as a means of controlling the Western powers \u2019 advances .\nIn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers with more detailed \u2013 but still far from unambiguous \u2013 information about the Ryukyus and their relations with China , Satsuma , and the bakufu .\nTherefore , although in the 1860s the bakufu had no intention of incorporating the kingdom , it had in effect created a diplomatic environment that would prove advantageous to Meiji Japan when it eventually decided to annex the kingdom.15 Based on the foregoing analysis , it is reasonable to dismiss the Ryukyuan treaties as irrelevant and problematic in terms of Japan \u2019 s international relations .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any encroachment on the islands would potentially involve the Ryukyus \u2019 treaty partners .\nIn the sections that follow , I demonstrate that the discussions between the Japanese Foreign Minister , Soejima Taneomi , and the Western ministers based in Tokyo over Japan \u2019 s \u201c alleged \u201d annexation of the kingdom in late 1872 illustrate the intentions \u2013 and involvement \u2013 of all parties in ways that are not immediately apparent .\nBy examining these negotiations and their outcomes in detail , I tease out Japan \u2019 s skillful responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of the Ryukyus.16 The debate over the political status of the Ryukyus within the Meiji government Japan \u2019 s encounter with the Western imperialist powers generated constant anxiety about the nation \u2019 s security .\nThe Meiji leaders fully understood that the \u201c unequal treaties , \u201d which had been signed by the Tokugawa bakufu in the 1850s , had placed Japan in a subordinate position with respect to the Western powers and , because of this , their revision was to be given top priority.D While the main object of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treaties , the Meiji officials who visited the US and Europe clearly understood from the inflexible attitudes of their Western counterparts that it would require a long process of radical reform to achieve their goal .\nThe other pressing issue , as I noted at the outset , was the need for Meiji Japan to establish well-defined national borders .\nAlthough the Meiji government had provisionally assigned control of the Ryukyus to the newly established Kagoshima prefecture ( 1871 ) , in the spring of 1872 , when the Iwakura Mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss the Ryukyu Kingdom \u2019 s political status in earnest .\nFrom their discussions , three main proposals emerged .\nFirst , the deputy minister of the Ministry of Finance , Inoue Kaoru , proposed that Japan abolish the dual subordination system and , in order to enhance the prestige of the Meiji Emperor , bring the Ryukyu Kingdom under exclusive Japanese rule.18 Japan \u2019 s Foreign Minister , Soejima Taneomi , who also sought to bring the Ryukyus under Japan \u2019 s exclusive rule , proposed that , as a first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should receive his investiture from the Meiji emperor .\nSoejima also suggested appointing Sh\u014d Tai as king of a newly established Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain and terminating all \u201c private intercourse \u201d ( shik\u014d ) between the Ryukyu Kingdom and foreign countries.19 The third proposal came from the members of the sain , or Ministry of the Left , who submitted a detailed , nine-point plan that argued that Japan should maintain the status quo by declaring publicly that the Ryukyu Kingdom was subordinate to both China and Japan.20 In the event , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ryukyu Kingdom was required to dispatch an embassy to Tokyo .\nAt around the same time ( early summer 1872 ) , news of what became known as the Taiwan Incident reached the Meiji government .\nIn 1871 , a group of fishermen from the Ryukyus \u2019 Miyako Island were shipwrecked on an isolated part of the Taiwanese coast ; 54 of the 69 survivors were killed by indigenous people known as the Botan .\nFor Japan \u2019 s leaders , the incident underlined the need to resolve the Ryukyus \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the new Meiji state.21 On October 16 , 1872 , when the Ryukyuan embassy arrived in Tokyo , the Meiji emperor formally appointed the king of the Ryukyus , Sh\u014d Tai , as king of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain \u2013 a move that seemed intended to replicate the Chinese emperor \u2019 s investiture of the Ryukyuan royal line .\nDespite this installation having no precedent in relations between Japan and the Ryukyus , the Meiji leaders used it to establish a clear hierarchical relationship between the Japanese emperor and the Ryukyuan king.22 This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meiji leaders to bring the Ryukyu Kingdom into a closer relationship with their central government administration .\nIt is important to keep in mind , however , that at the time these events were taking place , king Sh\u014d Tai was in Okinawa and was unaware that the Meiji government had conferred this new title on him through his ambassadors ( the significance of this is made clear below ) .\nFor some Japanese officials , the emperor \u2019 s investiture of the Ryukyuan king meant that the kingdom \u2019 s international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , on the same day that Sh\u014d Tai was appointed king of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain , Kabayama Sukenori , a major general in the Imperial Japanese Army hailing from the former domain of Satsuma , recorded in his diary that Sh\u014d Tai \u2019 s new role meant that the Ryukyus \u2019 treaties with the Western powers had been effectively rescinded.23 Thus , just as the Tokugawa bakufu had not regarded the Ryukyus \u2019 foreign treaties as an impediment to its control of the kingdom , Kabayama did not foresee further involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that , as he thought , the treaties had been abolished .\nShortly after the investiture , on October 30 , 1872 , the Meiji government replaced the resident magistrate appointed by Satsuma with a branch office of the Foreign Ministry to oversee the Ryukyus \u2019 diplomatic relations with the powers .\nAware of the diplomatic sensitivities involved , the Meiji leaders decided against informing the Qing of Sh\u014d Tai \u2019 s new appointment , allowing the Ryukyus to continue tributary relations with China .\nHowever , during the Ryukyuan embassy \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government informed the American and French representatives , albeit informally , that Japan would henceforth assume responsibility for the Ryukyus \u2013 a clear indication of Japan \u2019 s new stance toward the kingdom .\nIn the pre-telegraph age \u2013 as was the case in East Asia in the 1870s \u2013 the actions and decisions of diplomats stationed abroad often had an immense influence on the diplomacy of their governments .\nAs we will see , it was a time when the exchange of notes between diplomats could change the status of territory regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Foreign Minister Soejima Taneomi revealed his plans for the Ryukyus to the American minister in Tokyo , Charles E. De Long , the status of the treaty that the kingdom had signed with the US in 1854 emerged as a question of major importance.24 After Soejima privately informed De Long of Japan \u2019 s annexation of the Ryukyus ( as a result of Sh\u014d Tai \u2019 s appointment as king of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain ) , on October 20 , 1872 , the American minister wrote to Soejima seeking clarification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you advised me a few days since that the King of the Lew Chew Islands had been called upon by the Japanese Government to resign his titles and estates to it , which had been done , letters patent of nobility issued to him constituting him a member of the nobility of your Empire ranking [ him ] as to the former daimios , thus incorporating Lew Chew as an integral portion of the Japanese Empire ; I feel called upon to call your attention to a Compact entered into between the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America , on the 11th of July 1854 \u2026 and to ask if the same will be observed in all its provisions by Your Government within the territorial limits of the former Kingdom.25 It is clear from this letter that De Long understood ( from Soejima \u2019 s words ) that Sh\u014d Tai had resigned his \u201c titles and estates \u201d to the Meiji government and that the Ryukyus had been incorporated into Japan.26 This is an important point because , according to Japanese sources , at that time ( 1872 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear their intention \u201c to annex \u201d the Ryukyus.27 As soon as he learned of the kingdom \u2019 s new status , De Long sought assurances that the change of status would not negatively affect the US and its treaty .\nDe Long \u2019 s exchange with Soejima in 1872 has long been known to scholarship ; previous studies have used it to demonstrate the close relationship between the two men.28 However , earlier studies have failed to consider why , of all the questions he might have put , De Long asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for the 1854 treaty .\nDe Long \u2019 s reasoning is clarified in a letter he sent to the US Secretary of State , Hamilton Fish , in which he explained Sh\u014d Tai \u2019 s new appointment and the consequent formal incorporation of the Ryukyus into Japan .\nDe Long wrote that the king \u201c had accepted \u201d his new title and the kingdom \u2019 s incorporation .\nAs we have seen , however , Sh\u014d Tai did not know what was happening in Tokyo at that time .\nMost likely De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Soejima had told him .\nNext , De Long noted that the Ryukyus\u2013US Compact , which had been \u201c proclaimed \u201d by American President Franklin Pierce in 1855 , \u201c gave to our people certain privileges not embodied in our treaty with Japan \u201d and that because of this he had requested , and obtained , an undertaking from the Japanese Foreign Minister to respect and observe its contents.29 Thus , De Long was unconcerned by the Ryukyus \u2019 new status so long as Americans could continue to enjoy freedom of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right they did not have in Japan at that time.30 In his letter to Fish , De Long also noted that the Taiwan Incident gave the US an \u201c opportunity \u201d ( with the assistance of the former American Consul in Amoi , General C. Le Gendre ) to \u201c put our legation at Peking and yourself [ Fish ] in such rapport with the views and intentions of this government [ Japan ] as to be of substantial benefit to us and at the same time advance my standing and intimacy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 Because De Long was seeking to ingratiate himself with the Japanese government and be seen to cooperate with them , it seems he had no interest in verifying the accuracy of Soejima \u2019 s claims about the new status of the Ryukyus .\nIn response , Fish approved De Long \u2019 s request to take measures to ensure that the Japanese government would observe the Ryukyus\u2013US Compact.32 Fish wrote that \u201c it is supposed that the absorption or incorporation of one state by another does not discharge or release , within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the obligation which it may be under to a third power at the time of such absorption or incorporation.\n\u201d 33 It is thus clear that in the Americans \u2019 interpretation , Japan \u2019 s annexation of the Ryukyus was that it was a fait accompli \u2013 a precondition for future discussion with Japan as to whether it would respect the 1854 treaty .\nFish \u2019 s phrase , \u201c it is supposed , \u201d is of particular interest .\nIn his view , following the incorporation of one state into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations included in international treaties would not be rescinded .\nA thorough investigation of the position of international law on this question at that time would require a separate article .\nHere , however , it is sufficient to consider the point that precisely because De Long informed Fish that Japan had already assured him that it would uphold American privileges in the Ryukyus , Fish promptly approved this arrangement , which he \u201c supposed \u201d was in accordance with international law.34 The French government is informed of the Ryukyus \u2019 annexation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Louis de Turenne , also played an important role in events as they unfolded in late 1872.35 On October 16 , 1872 ( the same day Sh\u014d Tai was appointed king of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain ) , Turenne wrote to his government informing it that some days previously , Soejima had told him of Japan \u2019 s intention to claim the Ryukyus , and that this decision was closely connected to the Taiwan Incident .\nTurenne informed Paris that he understood the reasoning behind Soejima \u2019 s plan , since the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Asia , might have an interest in the islands .\nTurenne had responded by telling Soejima that he hoped he would succeed in his intentions .\nTurenne also reported that he had asked Soejima whether he expected Chinese opposition to Japan \u2019 s plans for the Ryukyus , as Beijing had exercised its own rights over the archipelago for three centuries .\nAccording to Turenne , Soejima replied that he was planning to propose \u201c a compromise \u201d to the Ryukyuan ambassador : Japanese assistance and abolition of the traditional annual tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s commitment to reject Chinese \u201c interference \u201d in the kingdom \u2019 s affairs .\nOnce this deal was accepted , and if the Ryukyuan \u201c prince \u201d ( Soejima was likely referring to the king ) was willing to renounce his \u201c essential attributes of sovereignty \u201d ( aux attributs essentiels de la souverainet\u00e9 ) , Soejima planned to have the kingdom redesignated as a han ( domain ) and to appoint the Ryukyuan king as a member of the Japanese court .\nTurenne argued that Soejima \u2019 s plan deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he thought it unlikely that the two countries would go to war over the issue , it was likely to destabilize Japan\u2013China relations once China learned of it.36 Turenne \u2019 s report to his government reveals that , before Sh\u014d Tai was appointed king of the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain on October 16 , 1872 , Soejima had already obtained Turenne \u2019 s tacit approval for Japan \u2019 s intention to annex the kingdom and transform it into a Japanese domain .\nAlthough Soejima told Turenne that he was planning to offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evidence that any such offer was ever extended from the Meiji leaders to the Ryukyuan envoys .\nA few days later , on October 29 , Turenne again wrote to Paris with the news that Soejima had informed him that the Ryukyuan ambassador had accepted his offer of compromise and , as a result , \u201c apart from the possibility of Chinese interference in this matter , \u201d the territory \u2019 s incorporation into Japan \u201c can be considered as accomplished.\n\u201d 37 Although France had earlier signed a treaty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turenne did not refer to this in the letter .\nFor him , the Ryukyu Kingdom was dependent on both China and Japan ; he also saw it as the possible target of American and German imperialism , as well as a complicating factor in China\u2013Japan relations .\nLike De Long , Turenne also accepted Soejima \u2019 s statements without verifying them ( as we have seen , since there was no offer of compromise on the table , the ambassador could not have accepted what did not exist ) .\nTurenne did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him that the ambassador had accepted the offer without specifying whether the king had indeed renounced his \u201c essential attributes of sovereignty.\n\u201d Thus , French diplomatic sources reveal that in late 1872 Soejima was already talking about the Ryukyus \u2019 annexation to Japan to a senior French official .\nAt this point , some clarification is in order .\nSince France had decided not to ratify the treaty it had made with the Ryukyus , it is understandable that Turenne did not raise the treaty as an issue during his meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than seeing the Ryukyus as an independent kingdom , Turenne maintained the view that the islands were subordinate to both China and Japan .\nHowever , it is important to appreciate that , based on the surviving sources , neither the Ryukyuan , Meiji , nor Qing governments ever made an issue of this lack of ratification .\nIn 1862 , a French mission had gone to the Ryukyus and ascertained that the treaty France had signed with the kingdom in 1855 was still being observed by the Ryukyuan authorities .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the treaty with France remained in force .\nHowever , when in 1867 the French government ( after consulting Holland about the status of its treaty with the Ryukyus ) decided not to ratify the treaty , it did not notify the Ryukyu Kingdom of its decision to drop the Ryukyuan-French Treaty from its list of formal treaties.38 Thus , in the eyes of the Ryukyuan , Japanese , and Chinese governments , the Ryukyuan\u2013French Treaty was a formal and binding agreement and , as a result , their respective heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryukyuan affairs to be significant .\nIn other words , far from being a mere bystander , the French government was another actor involved , at least indirectly , in the developing Ryukyuan story .\nAt this point , let us reconsider what we have examined so far from the Meiji government \u2019 s perspective .\nAs we have seen , neither De Long nor Turenne sought further clarification about Soejima \u2019 s assertions and informed their governments that the Ryukyuan king and his ambassador had accepted the Japanese government \u2019 s offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Japan .\nReturning to the negotiations between De Long and Soejima \u2013 as De Long \u2019 s inquiry showed , the Americans had privileges in the Ryukyus and were unwilling to renounce their treaty rights .\nDe Long asked that the treaty be honored in all its provisions and sine die ( indefinitely ) .\nBut , at the same time , by using the words \u201c thus incorporating Lew Chew as an integral portion of the Japanese Empire , \u201d he was effectively admitting that the Ryukyus had been annexed .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to question the kingdom \u2019 s incorporation and to consult Japan alone on the future of the US\u2013Ryukyu Compact was key to determining Soejima \u2019 s stance on the Ryukyuan-American Treaty .\nThis had a doubly favorable outcome for Japan : It both offered Meiji leaders a prudent solution to the problem of the pre-existing treaty ( by implicitly suggesting that Japan assume responsibility for it ) and , more importantly , it assured the Japanese government that , so long as it upheld the treaty in all its provisions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ryukyus .\nMindful of De Long \u2019 s interests , Soejima did not argue that the Ryukyus \u2019 treaties were invalid ( or had been rescinded , as some Japanese officials believed ) , as this would have certainly triggered American objections .\nAs we have seen , in the 1870s Japan was politically subordinate to the Western powers and would not risk antagonizing the Americans on the Ryukyuan issue .\nThe best option for Japan was to accede to the concessions demanded by De Long .\nOn November 5 , 1872 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c The Lew Chew Islands have been dependencies of this empire for hundreds of years , and to them the title of Han [ domain ] was recently given.\n\u201d Giving the Ryukyus the status of a domain was , according to Soejima , all that the Meiji government had done until that point .\nThen , using De Long \u2019 s own words , he went on : \u201c As you [ De Long ] say , the Lew Chew being an integral portion of the Japanese Empire , it is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be observed by this government.\n\u201d 39 Soejima showed his diplomatic skills by using De Long \u2019 s own words to demonstrate that his American colleague had already acknowledged the kingdom \u2019 s annexation ; this being the case , Soejima felt able to grant major concessions to the US government in return for its tacit approval of Japan \u2019 s annexation of the Ryukyus .\nIn assessing these bilateral discussions , it is important to appreciate that , initially , De Long had asked whether Japan would honor the Ryukyuan\u2013American Treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rejected at this stage ( Kabayama , for example , was talking about \u201c abrogation \u201d of the treaties , not \u201c upholding \u201d them ) .\nConsequently , Soejima accepted De Long \u2019 s suggestion that Japan take full responsibility for the treaty signed by the Ryukyu Kingdom with the US .\nIn this way , the Meiji leaders deftly sidelined one of the strongest potential supporters of the kingdom \u2019 s autonomy , given that the American government alone had ratified its treaty with the Ryukyus .\nFollowing De Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , the US and Japanese governments reached an important , albeit informal , consensus .\nOn December 21 , 1872 , Mori Arinori , the representative of the Meiji government in Washington , D.C. , wrote to Soejima informing the Japanese government that during a \u201c private conversation \u201d with Fish , the secretary of state had assured him that \u201c so long as Japan upholds the [ Ryukyuan\u2013American ] Treaty in all its provisions and does not make any changes to it , [ the US government ] will not raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through an informal understanding between the two governments , the Meiji government obtained tacit approval from the US for the continuation of the Ryukyuan-American Treaty and , more importantly , of Japan \u2019 s annexation of the Ryukyus .\nFrom that time , the Meiji government \u2013 which , as we have seen , gave little weight to France and Holland \u2019 s decision not to ratify their respective Ryukyuan treaties \u2013 handled the kingdom \u2019 s treaties with kid gloves , even to the extent of making no mention of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , Japan left both countries to make the first move in any discussion of the treaties , although the issue was never raised by either party .\nJapan only discussed the Ryukyuan treaties when other nations raised the matter first , as happened with the US .\nIn March 1873 , with the clear intention of proving that Japan was in charge of Ryukyuan diplomacy , the Meiji government ordered the Ryukyus to hand over the original documents on which the three treaties were based .\nAlthough Ryukyuan officials firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized in May 1874 and the Meiji leaders then returned to the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain a copy of the original documents .\nAt that point , the Ryukyuan officials implored the Meiji leaders not to change the content of their treaties during negotiations with the powers.42 A number of other powers were also focusing their attention on the Ryukyuan treaties .\nOn August 27 , 1873 , at the very time when the foreign ministers in Tokyo were pressing Japan to open up the interior of the country to foreigners , the Italian Acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German Minister , Maximilian A.

Von Brandt , each sent very similar requests to Soejima .\nHaving acknowledged that the Ryukyus were now an integral part of Japan ( even though the islands would not be formally incorporated for six years ) , they asked the Meiji government to submit notes granting Italian and German vessels and citizens the same rights and privileges included in the former Ryukyuan treaties and extended to the US , France , and Holland .\nIt is interesting to observe that both diplomats considered that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notes was sufficient for the granting of these concessions .\nThe alternative , they noted , was for the Meiji government to sign a new treaty that would meet their requests , if that was its preferred option.43 Thus , while the Italian and German representatives sought major concessions ( the upholding of the Ryukyuan treaties in all their provisions and indefinitely , even though neither Italy nor Germany had had formal relations with the Ryukyus ) , by offering to settle the issue through the exchange of notes they also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undermine the Japanese government ; in fact , a simple exchange of letters would avoid invoking the MFN clause enjoyed by all of Japan \u2019 s treaty partners .\nOn September 19 , 1873 , Soejima replied that he would handle the matter as outlined in their proposal and would inform the Ry\u016bky\u016b Domain of the new arrangements.44 In this way , in return for Italy and Germany \u2019 s tacit approval , the Meiji government granted them the same privileges enjoyed by the US , France , and Holland in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and France and , after 1873 , Italy and Germany ) had accepted that Japan had formal responsibility for the Ryukyus , Japan had only to convince the Chinese government and , to a lesser extent , the Ryukyuan authorities , who now found themselves stripped of their former ( albeit \u201c theatrical \u201d ) diplomatic status .\nThe Western diplomats in Japan were the representatives of imperialist states that were naturally focused on their own interests and privileges .\nCertainly , they did not feel any moral or other kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or autonomy .\nRather , they perceived the kingdom as a minor actor in the East Asian arena , having nothing of great value to offer their ambitions .\nHowever , the fact that a number of Western diplomats had accepted the Japanese annexation so swiftly was advantageous for the still politically weak Japan , whose attitude toward the imperialist powers veered between suspicion and admiration .\nAt the same time , the diplomats \u2019 acceptance of Japan \u2019 s actions put the Ryukyuan authorities into a difficult spot .\nThey were unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan with Western blessing , and they wanted to maintain their former arrangements with China and Japan .\nIn addition , the Chinese government knew nothing about the informal understanding reached by Soejima with a handful of Western diplomats .\nIt was in this context that when in 1873 a group of Ryukyuan officials in Tokyo sought guarantees of their kingdom \u2019 s future from Soejima ( who had just returned from China for the ratification of the 1871 Sino-Japanese Treaty ) , the Japanese foreign minister told them that the Ryukyuan polity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity \u201d ( kokutai seitai eiky\u016b ai kawarazu ) .45 Significantly , Western documents reveal information about the annexation that is not found in Japanese sources .\nIn private meetings , Soejima sought to justify the Japanese incorporation of the Ryukyus by assuring De Long and Turenne that the Ryukyuans \u2013 the Ryukyuan king and his ambassador \u2013 had accepted annexation , despite the fact that this was not the case .\nIn other words , during the build-up to formal annexation , Soejima was careful to ensure that both the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Ryukyus ) would not raise any objections to Japan \u2019 s plans .\nBritain had its own intelligence sources on the matter .\nOn October 22 , 1872 , the British Acting Minster in Tokyo , R. G. Watson , informed his government of the arrival of the Ryukyuan embassy in the Japanese capital , noting that the Meiji government \u201c it seems has taken advantage of the visit of this mission to take Loochoo entirely under its protection , and to incorporate it with the Japanese Empire \u201d as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson did not receive this information directly from Soejima , as De Long and Turenne had done .\nApparently , Soejima selected the diplomats to whom he disclosed Japan \u2019 s plans for the Ryukyus.47 The legacy of De Long \u2019 s inquiry and Soejima \u2019 s response In May 1874 Meiji Japan invaded Taiwan to revenge the 1871 massacre of a group of shipwrecked Ryukyuan fishermen.48 Although , following protracted negotiations between China and Japan , the two countries signed an agreement on October 31 , 1874 , they failed to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year later , in early 1875 , what was to be the last Ryukyuan tributary embassy arrived in Beijing .\nThe Taiwan Expedition and the arrival of this mission in China showed that the Ryukyus had not in fact been incorporated to Japan , as previously declared in the American and French dispatches .\nAt this point , the Japanese Acting Minister in Beijing , Tei Einei , informed his American colleague , Minister B. P. Avery , that the Meiji government had decided to assert \u201c the complete jurisdiction of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1875 , Avery informed the US Secretary of State , H. Fish , of these developments.49 On July 29 , 1875 , Fish wrote to John Bingham , who had replaced De Long in Tokyo two years earlier , reminding him that \u201c A compact was concluded between the United states and the Royal Government of the Lewchew \u2026 granting certain privileges to American citizens and vessels going to the Lew Chew islands.\n\u201d Fish was citing the very words used by De Long in 1872 ; now , he instructed Bingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of any consolidation of those islands by Japan , see to it that our compact be preserved , unless it should be found more advantageous \u2026 to apply the treaty with Japan.\n\u201d 50 These exchanges show that , mindful of the 1872 developments , Fish focused on American privileges that must be \u201c preserved \u201d or even increased in the event that the treaty with Japan proved more advantageous to the Americans in the Ryukyus .\nFollowing Fish \u2019 s instructions , on April 4 , 1876 Bingham wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munenori : \u201c I make these inquiries because it is the wish of my Government to know whether anything has been done in the premises which in anywise contravenes , limits , or changes the subsisting compact between my Government and that of the Lew Chew Islands.\n\u201d 51 Again we see a persistent concern that Japan preserve US treaty rights in the territory of the Ryukyu Kingdom.52 On May 31 , 1876 , Terashima ( who had asked about , and consequently been informed by the Meiji government about Soejima \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bingham , writing that \u201c this government [ Japan ] has not at any time interfered with the rights of the United States as secured by its subsisting compact with the Lew Chew and before taking such action this Government will confer with the Government of the United States.\n\u201d 54 We can observe a nuanced shift in the Japanese strategy around the Ryukyuan\u2013American Treaty .\nWhereas in 1872 Soejima had promised De Long to uphold the treaty in its entirety and indefinitely , in 1876 , Terashima informed Bingham that Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryukyus .\nAlthough , in the near future , Japan was planning to make some changes to the arrangement , he assured his American colleague that \u201c before taking such action , \u201d the Meiji government would inform the US government .\nAfter receiving Terashima \u2019 s reply , the US government did not make further inquiries on the matter and , for a second time , the Ryukyuan issue was settled through an exchange of notes between the Japanese Foreign Minister and the American Minister in Tokyo .\nThe Ryukyus \u2019 request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1878 As part of their attempt to preserve the kingdom , the Ryukyuan authorities called on the US , France , and Britain ( whose diplomats also represented the Dutch government in Tokyo ) for help .\nWhile the events of 1878-79 require a detailed and thorough analysis , in what follows I set out only the major points for reasons of space.55 In August 1878 , the American minister John Bingham met a group of senior Ryukyuan officials in Tokyo , who urged the US government to prevent the annexation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their petitions , these officials received a good deal of support and guidance from the Chinese legation .\nThe petitioners set out in detail the five-century history of tributary relations between China and the Ryukyus ; they explained that the US , France , and Holland had concluded treaties with the Ryukyus , specifying that the agreements were to be written in Chinese and dated according to the Chinese calendar .\n\u201c As to our intercourse with Japan \u201d before 1868 , the petitioners merely stated that \u201c it was formerly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed the \u201c compulsory orders \u201d issued by the Meiji government from 1872 onward , which , among other things , specified that \u201c all business \u201d in the islands \u201c should be transacted with the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\u201d They pointed out that \u201c in your petitioners \u2019 humble opinion though our kingdom be but a small nationality , nevertheless , it is a nationality.\n\u201d On the treaties , they argued that if the Ryukyus had been prohibited from enjoying the same tributary relations with China , since \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written in Chinese and dated according to the Chinese calendar , they \u201c will be like so much wastepaper.\n\u201d Finally , they pointed out that as \u201c the United States recognized and treated Lew chew as a distinct nationality and permitted us to enter into treaty relations , \u2026 we turn to the United States , in the hope that they may advise and induce Japan to leave Lew Chew to remain as it has been hitherto.\n\u201d 56 In sum , the approach taken by the petitioners was to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing treaty relations and to paper over their former relations with Satsuma and the bakufu.57 ( The petitions handed to the French and British legations were very similar in content . )\nIn response , Bingham informed his government that Japan \u2019 s demands on the Ryukyus infringed the Ryukyus\u2013US Treaty and , more importantly , that \u201c It seems to me that this Government [ Japan ] is too late in asserting supreme authority over those islands after allowing them perfect freedom for five centuries , and manifestly assenting to the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] taken by Lew Chew with our own Government in 1854.\n\u201d 58 Bingham \u2019 s response is significant because of the chain of logic that it demonstrated : based on his own interpretation of international law , a senior Western diplomat had concluded that \u2013 because Japan had allowed the Ryukyus to continue their relations with China and sign a treaty with the US \u2013 there was a good case for the Ryukyus to be seen as independent of Japan .\nBingham saw the infringement of the Ryukyuan-American Treaty as a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBingham \u2019 s criticism of Japan is especially significant when we consider that , in contrast to most Western diplomats , he had displayed an empathy and sensitivity toward Japan during his long tenure in Tokyo ( 1873-1885 ) and made serious efforts to revise the many \u201c unequal treaties \u201d that Japan had concluded with the West.59 We can not dismiss the fact , however , that Bingham based his opinions on the Ryukyuan petition , which failed to mention Satsuma \u2019 s de facto control of the Ryukyus .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state , F. W. Seward , replied to Bingham : \u201c According to the information in the possession of the Department the independence of the Lew Chew Islands is a matter of dispute solely between the government of China and the Lew Chew Islands on one side and the government of Japan on the other , and is a question in which this government can not interfere unless its rights under Treaty stipulations with any of the powers concerned in the controversy appear to be endangered.\n\u201d Seward also reminded Bingham that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terashima \u2019 s reply to Bingham of May 31 , 1876 ) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs does not appear to be inconsistent either with the stipulation of the instrument above referred to or with any information hitherto communicated to this Department.\n\u201d 60 In other words , the US government saw no reasons to intervene in the matter because Japan had been continuing to honor the Ryukyus\u2013US Treaty .\nThe Ryukyuan officials fared no better with France .\nIn late 1878 , while the Chinese legation in Japan was pressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had arrived in Japan a year earlier ) to meet the Ryukyuan envoys , Geoffrey wrote to his government that he was trying to avoid meeting the Ryukyuan officials and , more importantly , that France had \u201c no direct interest \u201d in supporting Chinese ( and Ryukyuan ) claims , even if they were supported by the \u201c law \u201d ( or even if they were simply \u201c just \u201d ) .\nHe also argued that if France had to choose between China and Japan on the issue , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which \u201c we have more to gain in moral and material [ terms ] .\n\u201d 61 In the end , the Chinese legation succeeded in arranging an appointment between the Ryukyuan envoys and Geoffrey ; however , the minister did not change his mind after meeting with the Ryukyuan officials and reading their petition .\nAt the time , French sympathies were warmer towards Japan than China , as France \u2019 s relations with China were becoming increasingly complicated and strained over the Tonkin question concerning the status of northern Vietnam on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also important to note that Geoffrey refused to support the Ryukyus , not because France had not yet ratified its treaty with the tiny kingdom , but because he did not foresee any direct interest in championing its cause.62 In early 1879 , after a summary of the Ryukyuan officials \u2019 petitions had been published in the Nichi Nichinewspaper , the British minister in Japan , Harry Parkes , questioned Foreign Minister Terashima Munenori about Japan \u2019 s plans in the Ryukyus .\nWhen Parkes insisted that it was commonly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China ( in addition to Japan ) , Terashima argued that the distinction between \u201c tribute \u201d and \u201c taxes \u201d proved that the Ryukyus had not been subordinate to the Qing , but only to Satsuma , which had been collecting taxes from the kingdom.63 This distinction became a crucial argument in Japan \u2019 s claims on the Ryukyus as East Asia subscribed increasingly to Western-based international law .\nAs we have seen , the Meiji government did not rescind the Ryukyuan treaties ; instead , Soejima and Terashima promised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would continue .\nTheir promises to the US government bore fruit at the precise moment when the Ryukyuan authorities were seeking American help .\nOn the other hand , from late 1878 , Qing officials were at pains to point out to Japan and Western diplomats alike that the Ryukyu Kingdom had concluded international treaties on its own behalf .\nThe Chinese claims were mainly based on the fact that the kingdom had been a tributary of China for centuries , that the Ryukyus had signed these foreign treaties as an independent state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of the 1871 Sino-Japanese Treaty.64 After the Qing court began issuing strongly worded protests through its Tokyo-based diplomats opposing Japan \u2019 s action in the islands and Ryukyuan officials petitioned foreign diplomats , the Meiji government decided to proceed with formal annexation to avoid the Ryukyuan issue escalating into an international dispute .\nShortly after the establishment of Okinawa prefecture in April 1879 , Meiji constitutional expert Inoue Kowashi handed the Japanese government an important memorandum discussing potential friction between Japan and China over the new prefecture.65 Inoue , who drafted most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1870s and 80s , told his government that the three treaties which the Ryukyu Kingdom had signed in the 1850s would likely become a major sticking point for Japan.66 In the memorandum ( dated July 3 , 1879 ) , Inoue pointed out that if the Qing were to claim that the Ryukyus were a semi-independent state , the Meiji government would find it very difficult to counter this argument .\nInoue pointed to numerous examples in the West where , when a powerful state tried to annex a small country which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers joined together to oppose the incorporation .\nInoue feared that the Qing might join with the powers and apply this strategy to the Ryukyus ; in such a case , Japan would need to work very hard to counter this kind of argument .\nNext , Inoue pointed out that the fact that the Ryukyus had signed treaties with the US , France , and Holland in the 1850s was \u201c a matter of the greatest difficulty \u201d ( ichi no kon \u2019 nan naru jij\u014d ) .\nBecause this was tantamount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements , the Meiji government would be at great pains to defend its position ; moreover , these treaties were valid instruments .\nDated according to the Chinese calendar , they were written in Western and Chinese languages , and were formally treaties of amity .\nAlthough the Ryukyus had been a Japanese dependency of Satsuma , in their external relations they had seemed to function as an independent state , thus giving the Chinese plenty of ammunition for their claims .\nNext , after retracing the exchange of notes between Soejima and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that Japan had never made arrangements with France and Holland about the treaties , Inoue pointed out that when the Japanese foreign ministers had advised the American diplomats that Japan would continue to uphold the Ryukyuan-American treaty , this implied that the Meiji government had admitted that the Ryukyuan treaties were valid instruments .\nIt also proved that the Meiji leaders had recognized that , in the past , the Ryukyus had the \u201c right \u201d ( kenri ) to sign treaties .\nGiven these realities , Inoue foresaw major obstacles for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support its claims through the lens of international law.67 Inoue warned that what Smits has called the Ryukyus \u2019 \u201c theatrical state and diplomacy , \u201d as well as the Meiji government \u2019 s decision to uphold the Ryukyuan-American Treaty , might turn out to be detrimental to Japan \u2019 s claims when placed under the spotlight of international law .\nIt is important to note , however , that while Inoue urged his government to prepare counter-arguments to the Chinese claims , he also appreciated that the treaties would become a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international issue \u2013 that is , if the Western powers became involved ( a possibility that , for various reasons , failed to eventuate ) .68 At the very time Inoue was presenting his memorandum , a number of key diplomats informed their goverments about the Ryukyuan issue .\nOn August 1 , 1879 , the day that Parkes sent the Ryukyuan petition to the British government , he wrote that \u201c a difference of a grave character has arisen between the Governments of China and Japan \u201d over Japan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while the Ryukyuan people had been paying tribute to both countries , \u201c they have at the same time formed a separate nationality and have enjoyed their own autonomy.\n\u201d 69 Then , when on August 29 Bingham sent the American government translations of the original documents that the Meiji leaders had presented to the Chinese government on July 16 concerning relations between the Ryukyus and Japan up to 1868 ( including the surrender documents signed by the Ryukyuan king and his officials in 1611 ) , he observed that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a very strong case if indeed it makes any case whatever for the action taken by Japan in 1872 and since.\n\u201d 70 When Parkes sent the same translations to his government , he wrote \u201c It seems to me that in claiming that they have exercised sovereign control over Loochoo for a long period\u2026the Japanese Government omit to explain why they permitted Loochoo to keep up direct official relations with China\u2026and to send every other year , with marked regularity and considerable ceremony , Public Envoys with tribute to the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the months following their reception , a number of influential Western diplomats had been influenced by the arguments of the Ryukyuan petitioners .\nAs Inoue \u2019 s memorandum shows , the Meiji leaders had already grasped the diplomatic significance of the Ryukyus \u2019 treaties and their potential legal significance .\nHowever , since the Ryukyu Kingdom had concluded several international treaties , it lay with the Western powers to choose to minimize their importance ; and it was only because of their tacit approval that Meiji Japan was able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaties .\nIn late 1879 , after the Chinese reasserted their claim that the Ryukyu Kingdom was both a tributary of China and an independent kingdom ( citing its international treaties as evidence ) , the Meiji government strongly rebutted their claims .\nThe Meiji leaders continued to frame the annexation of the Ryukyus as simply a matter of domestic reorganization by the Japanese government ;

prerequisites for attainment of national security in the true spirit .\nNo national leaders of today can ignore these factors , \u201d said Army chief Gen Bajwa , marking a significant iteration of Pakistan \u2019 s latest security policy .\n\u201c \u2026 , it is an almost universally acknowledged fact that the contemporary concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting a country from internal and external threats but also providing conducive environment in which aspirations of human security , national progress and development could be realised .\n\u201c Surely , it is not solely a function of armed forces anymore\u2026 \u201d Pakistan \u2019 s Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa said this in the keynote address he delivered , at the first-ever Islamabad Security Dialogue ( ISD ) on March 17-18 .\nThe Dialogue was inaugurated by Prime Minister Imran Khan .\nThe ISD was organised by the National Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country , the Centre for Aerospace and Security Studies , Islamabad Policy Research Institute , Institute of Strategic Studies , Institute of Regional Studies and National Defence University \u2019 s Institute of Strategic Studies , Research and Analysis .\nThe broad composition indicates the united political will of the Pakistani state .\nReuters from Islamabad thus reported the event , March 18 , 2021 : PTI reported : White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki had said on Feb 25 that the Biden administration remains \u201c closely engaged with a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including those in Pakistan.\n\u201d At a separate news conference , State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the administration had called on the parties to reduce tensions along the LoC by returning to the 2003 ceasefire agreement .\n\u201c We have been very clear that we condemn the terrorists who seek to infiltrate across the Line of Control , \u201d he said .\nThe USA sells peace as well as war as it suits from time to time .\nIn the eyes of the merchants of death , peace is the time between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade war too , which calls for shifts in policy .\nFor India and Pakistan , both dependent on USA , unfortunately this nudge from the super power was needed , fortunately this time for peace .\nNotably those engaged in backchannel talks with India were also associated in the ISD .\nFurther , on Kashmir , the General simply said : \u201c It is time to bury the past and move forward .\nBut for the resumption of the peace process or meaningful dialogue , our neighbour will have to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Who has to take the initiative ?\n\u201c The burden was on India \u201d said Bajwa .\nNay , the onus is on Pakistan , said India .\nNotwithstanding this refrain , it shows the thaw on both sides .\nFurther , it was really not so \u201c unexpected joint ceasefire , \u201d and it is based on political economy , as this report by indiatoday.in , March 19 , 2021 , indicates the chain of recent events : \u201c Bajwa said that \u201c stable \u201d Indo-Pak relations is a \u201c key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and Central Asia by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia\u2026he also said that the potential of the region has \u201c forever remained hostage to disputes and issues between two nuclear neighbours \u201d .\n\u201c Calling the Kashmir dispute the \u201c heart of this problem \u201d , General Bajwa said , \u201c It is important to understand that without the resolution of Kashmir dispute through peaceful means , the process of sub-continental rapprochement will always remain susceptible to derailment due to politically motivated bellicosity \u201c \u2026 \u201c Our position is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan in an environment free of terror , hostility and violence .\nThe onus is on Pakistan for creating such an environment , \u201d Anurag Srivastava , spokesperson at the Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA ) , said during his weekly briefing on February 4 .\n\u201c This came in the wake of General Bajwa \u2019 s earlier offer of peace , February 2 , while speaking at the graduation ceremony at the Pakistan Air Force ( PAF ) .\nHe had said , \u201c Pakistan and India must resolve the longstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified and peaceful manner as per the aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\u201d \u201c India and Pakistan had announced on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control ( LoC ) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors .\nThe ceasefire continues to hold , which is a positive sign .\n\u201c India had last month said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror , hostility and violence .\nIndia had said the onus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of terror and hostility .\n\u201c General Qamar Javed Bajwa stressed however that the burden was on India to create a \u201c conducive environment \u201d , and said Washington had a role to play in ending regional conflicts .\n\u201c Pakistan and India , both nuclear-armed countries , have fought three wars , and in 2019 , tensions rose dramatically post the Pulwama terror attack and the Balakot aristrikes\u2026 \u201d Dr. Tara Kartha , Former Director , India \u2019 s National Security Council Secretariat , explained and underlined the significance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mar 20 , 2021 : \u201c These are stirring times in Islamabad , where the rich and the powerful gathered for the ISD\u2026.In Pakistan , the rich and the powerful are either politicians , businessmen or those in khaki , or even all three .\nAnd since it is they who run the country , what they say usually matters .\n\u201c The ISD was organised by the National Security Division , a body originally set up under Nawaz Sharif to serve as the secretariat of the Cabinet Committee on National Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet .\nLater called the National Security Committee , it was notified as the \u2018 principal decision-making body on national security \u2019 in a move quite unlike the advisory role such bodies have in most countries .\nThat it included the service chiefs hardly needs to be said\u2026.\n\u201d \u201c The idea is aimed at bringing think-tanks and policy-makers together , in a praiseworthy effort to benefit both .\nBureaucracies the world over are not very different from each other , particularly in South Asia , where there is usually a solid brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to break that wall is the first ever advisory portal , an integrated platform to exchange ideas with universities , think-tanks and the bureaucracies .\nThe second was obviously to get the army chief to lay down the proposals\u2026 \u201c This ( singular obsession with India ) now seems to be changing , just a little .\nIt started at the beginning of this year .\nIn February , there was talk of Pakistan prioritising geo-economics over other issues .\nThat was echoed by Foreign Minister Qureshi soon after Khan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about Sri Lanka being part of CPEC .\nNow at the ISD , PM Khan is talking of comprehensive security astonishingly , saying that security is not just about defence .\nUnsurprisingly , he praised China \u2019 s model , as he does at every forum available\u2026 Then he places national security within \u2018 South Asia \u2019 , as the least integrated of regions\u2026 If that \u2019 s not astonishing enough , there is the offer of regional connectivity .\nThat \u2019 s not just about China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an \u2018 inclusive , transparent \u2019 project for global and regional participation , particularly Afghanistan .\nWhat follows is best quoted in full .\nThe General says , \u201c Let me also emphasise that while CPEC remains central to our vision , only seeing Pakistan through the CPEC prism is also misleading .\nOur immensely vital geostrategic location and a transformed vision make us a country of immense and diverse potential which can very positively contribute to regional development and prosperity.\n\u201d In simple words , he \u2019 s offering up Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that Pakistan is ready for roads , railways and shipping to cross its territory into the rest of the world , including India .\nThat \u2019 s turning South Asian politics on its head\u2026 Delhi had better consider this connectivity push and its pros and cons rather than dither about Bajwa \u2019 s hostile antecedents .\nHere is an opportunity .\nTake it up .\nIt might mean money , and a lot of it .\nIt goes against the simplistic and inobjective notions spread in India that the Pakistan army decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated bellicosity \u201c \u2026And it reminds former Pakistan Gen Musharaff \u2019 s statement that the armed forces know better about , and suffer the vagaries of war .\nIn this context , it is instructive to recall words of wisdom : The text of Gen Bajwa \u2019 s speech , given below , gives a fuller picture and deeper insights of what is going on .\nFull text of Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa \u2019 s speech at the Islamabad Security Dialogue , March 17 , 2021 .\nIt is my profound privilege and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the best Pakistani and global minds .\n\u201c Together for ideas \u201d is a very appropriate theme chosen by the organisers for this dialogue .\nI am certain that the policy practitioners and scholars present here or participating virtually , will not only discuss Pakistan \u2019 s security vision but also formulate ideas to guide us on how best to tackle Pakistan \u2019 s future security challenges .\nI would like to appreciate the National Security Division for identifying the need for Pakistan to have its own security dialogue .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting together the first iteration of this Dialogue .\nI hope this trend of integrating intellectual input into policy-making continues to grow .\nLadies and gentlemen , it is an almost universally acknowledged fact that the contemporary concept of national security is not only about protecting a country from internal and external threats but also providing conducive environment in which aspirations of human security , national progress and development could be realised .\nSurely , it is not solely a function of armed forces anymore .\nNational security in the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an all-encompassing notion ; wherein , besides various elements of national power , global and regional environment also play a profound role .\nNational security is thus multi-layered : outer layers being the exogenous factors of global and regional environment and inner layers being the endogenous factors of internal peace , stability and developmental orientation .\nA nation at peace and a region in harmony are thus essential prerequisites for attainment of national security in the true spirit .\nNo national leaders of today can ignore these factors .\nI also firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can perceive and further its quest for security , as every single issue and security dilemma faced by today \u2019 s world is intimately linked with global and regional dynamics .\nWhether it be human security , extremism , human rights , environmental hazards , economic security or pandemics , responding in silos is no longer an option .\nThe world has seen ravages of World Wars and Cold War , wherein polarisation and neglect of virtues blighted human future and brought catastrophic consequences for humanity .\nOn the contrary , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards good of mankind .\nToday we face similar choices ; whether to stay etched in the acrimony and toxicity of the past , continue promoting conflict and get into another vicious cycle of war , disease and destruction ; or to move ahead , bring the dividends of our technological and scientific advancements to our people and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity .\nWe must not forget that the desire to achieve autarky was historically divisive and a stimulus for grabbing more , leading to \u201c haves \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taught us that the way ahead has always been through an interconnected , interdependent and collective sense of security\u2026 Today the leading drivers of change in the world are demography , economy and technology .\nHowever , one issue which remains central to this concept is economic security and cooperation .\nFrayed relations between various power centres of the globe and boomeranging of competing alliances can bring nothing but another stint of cold war .\nIt is naive to apply the failed solutions of yesteryears to the challenges of today and tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leading global players must reach a stable equilibrium in their relations through convergences instead of divergence .\nIn this environment , developing countries like Pakistan , today face multi-dimensional challenges , which can not be navigated single-handedly .\nA similar situation is confronted by other countries in our region as well , therefore , we all require a multilateral global and regional approach and cooperation to overcome these challenges .\nYou are well aware that South Asia is home to one quarter of world \u2019 s population .\nHowever , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettled disputes are dragging this region back to the swamp of poverty and underdevelopment .\nIt is saddening to know that even today it is among the least integrated regions of the world in terms of trade , infrastructure , water and energy cooperation .\nOn top of it , despite being one of the most impoverished regions of the world , we end up spending a lot of money on our defence , which naturally comes at the expense of human development .\nPakistan has been one of the few countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted the temptation of involving itself in an arms race .\nOur defence expenditures have rather reduced instead of increasing .\nThis is not an easy undertaking especially when you live in a hostile and unstable neighbourhood .\nBut , having said that , let me say profoundly that we are ready to improve our environment by resolving all our outstanding issues with our neighbours through dialogue in a dignified and peaceful manner .\nHowever , it is important to state that , this choice is deliberate and based on rationality and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is our sincere desire to re-cast Pakistan \u2019 s image as a peace-loving nation and a useful member of international community .\nOur leadership \u2019 s vision is Alhamdullilah transformational in this regard .\nWe have learned from the past to evolve and are willing to move ahead towards a new future , however , all this is contingent upon reciprocity .\nThe world knows that we are geo-strategically placed , to be a bridge between civilisations and connecting conduit between the regional economies .\nWe are a nation of significance due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile soil and adequate logistical infrastructure .\nWe intend to leverage our vital geostrategic location for ours own , regional and global benefit .\nOur robust role in current quest for peace in Afghanistan is proof of our goodwill and understanding of our global and moral obligations .\nOur close collaboration and crucial support for the peace process has led to the historic agreement between Taliban and US and paved the way for intra-Afghan dialogue .\nWe will continue to emphasise on a sustained and inclusive peace process for the betterment of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides offering our all-out support to Afghanistan peace process , we have also undertaken unprecedented steps to enhance Afghanistan \u2019 s trade and connectivity by : \u2022 Re-energising Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement and also providing access to Afghanistan to export her goods to India \u2022 Improving economic and trade environment along Pak-Afghan border by establishing border markets and development of infrastructure \u2022 Being part of energy and trade corridors binding Central .\nSouth and West Asia through land routes and inviting Afghanistan to be part of CPEC .\nStable Indo-Pak relation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South and Central Asia by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia .\nThis potential however , has forever remained hostage to disputes and issues between two nuclear neighbours .\nKashmir dispute is obviously at the head of this problem .\nIt is important to understand that without the resolution of Kashmir dispute through peaceful means , process of sub-continental rapprochement will always remain susceptible to derailment due to politically motivated bellicosity .\nHowever , we feel that it is time to bury the past and move forward .\nBut for resumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighbour will have to create conducive environment , particularly in Indian Occupied Kashmir .\ntoday we are a nation with tremendous geo-economic potential .\nIn order to carve a promising future for our people , it is important for us to embark upon a solid economic roadmap , backed up by infrastructural developments and regional integration .\nOur choices with respect to the same have been clear and explicit .\nThis geo-economic vision is centered around four core pillars : \u2022 One : Moving towards a lasting and enduring peace within and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind in the internal affairs of our neighbouring and regional countries \u2022 Four : Bringing sustainable development and prosperity through establishment of investment and economic hubs within the region Pakistan has been working towards all four aspects with unity of purpose and synchronisation within the various components of national security .\nWe had realised that unless our own house is in order , nothing good could be expected from outside .\nNow , after having overpowered the menace of terrorism and tide of extremism , we have begun to work towards sustainable development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nPakistan Army has contributed tremendously towards this national cause by rebuilding and mainstreaming some of the most neglected areas through massive development drives besides ensuring peace and security .\nOur long campaign against the tide of terrorism and extremism manifests our resolve and national will .\nWe have come a long way and yet we are a bit short of our final objective but we are determined to stay the course .\nCPEC has been at the heart of our economic transformation plan and we have left no quarter to declare its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our sincere efforts to make it inclusive , transparent and attractive , for all global and regional players , with the aim of bringing its benefits to everyone .\nLet me also emphasise that while CPEC remains central to our vision , only seeing Pakistan through CPEC prism is also misleading .\nOur immensely vital geostrategic location and a transformed vision make us a country of immense and diverse potential which can very positively contribute to regional development and prosperity .\nThis vision however remains incomplete without a stable and peaceful South Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , are with the same purpose .\nOur efforts for peace in Afghanistan , responsible and mature behavior in crisis situation with India manifest our desire to change the narrative of geo-political contestation into geo-economic integration .\nWhile we are doing our bid , a major contribution is to be made by the global players through their cooperation .\nI am sure that an economically interconnected South Asia is much more suited to them instead of a war-torn , crisis-ridden and destabilised region .\nWe also see hope in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional contestation into a gainful economic win-win for the world in general and the region , in particular , South Asia can be the starting point for regional cooperation .\nI have firm belief that economic and sustainable human development can guide us into a future , full of peace and prosperity .\nAnd finally , it is time that we in South Asia create synergy through connectivity , peaceful co-existence and resource sharing to fight hunger , illiteracy and disease instead of fighting each other .\nHope jingoists in India are listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site ,

introduced several changes in almost every part of the world .\nThe virus has not only resulted in damages resulting in high mortality and morbidity , but it has also made adverse qualitative changes in the lives of billions while its socio-political repercussions have devastated economies in the Global South .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening the wealth inequalities but it has also exposed the socio-economic vulnerabilities and the way the social protection system has crumbled depriving billions of their right to dignified life .\nThe neoliberal policies being pushed by the governments over the decades has resulted in deepening of crisis that expands during the pandemic .\nAlso , the lockdown imposed by the state led to chain of events that resulted in the loss of hard-gained rights and further marginalized those on margins .\nMoreover , the records of sufferings of those vulnerable are being erased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stifled by the compulsory distortion of reality .\nHowever , those on the margins continued to resist against the authoritarian regimes .\nFor instance , the ill-planned lockdown in India was imposed amidst the protests when the millions of citizens have been dissenting against the Citizenship Amendment Act .\nAs soon as the lockdown is imposed with merely four hours of warning , millions of migrant workers in cities defied the plea of the Prime Minister and walked thousands of miles to reach their homes .\nA year later , the resistance took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began protesting against the farm laws introduced by the government .\nAlso , the unwarranted policies of intense privatization resulted in increasing unemployment pushed by the state compelled millions of workers and students to join the protest .\nCurrently , the situation is that the state , instead of resolving the crisis caused due to the pandemic , seems to have initiated a war against its own citizens .\nThose in power are lamenting that ` too much democracy \u2019 is obstructing the tough reforms while ignoring the plight of the common citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , is about the onslaught of repression by the state whereby the state enacted the anti-people laws and policies behind the garb of lockdown , that have deeply scarred the society , yet on the other side , it has also seen the outrage and the resistance from those who have been marginalized by the autocratic regime .\nThough the vaccination may heal the impact in terms of morbidity and mortality caused due to the virus , however , achieving justice , political , economic and social , or the democratic ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take longer in the society ridden with the inequalities and oppressions at various levels and in different forms .\nPresently , the situation is that more the state is muzzling the dissent abusing its repressive power , more resolutely are dissenting the protestors .\nIt may therefore be said that the struggle against oppressive policies and laws may continue in the post-COVID world for an idea to forge a better more just world .\nIn December 2019 , when the Chinese authorities identified the human case of coronavirus , its neighbor India was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws where the protestors all over the country demanded to scrap the laws claiming that these are discriminatory .\n( Nigam , 2020 a ) Started as a spontaneous gathering at Shaheen Bagh resisting against the police violence and against the citizenship laws , it emerged into a successful non-violent movement to protect the ` idea of India \u2019 .\nGradually , many Shaheen Baghs emerged across the country where millions of men and women resisted against the repressive legal matrix .\n( The Indian Express , 2020 ) The goal of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the common people rebelled against the divisive ideology of hate .\n( Nigam , 2020 b ) The government refused to initiate any dialogue with the protestors .\nRather steps were taken by the ruling regime to malign the protestors and to question their integrity .\nThe state portrayed the protestors as enemies of the imagined Hindu rashtra .\nThe electricity at the protest site was cut off and the tents set up by the protestors were taken away in the freezing cold .\nThe sites were cleared after 101 days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to continue their fight for justice .\n( Lama , 2021 ) Later , during the lockdown , many students who participated have been arrested .\nThe Supreme Court in October 2020 observed that the right to protest in public places should be balanced with the right of the general public to move without hindrance .\nIndia imposed a strict brutal lockdown on 24 March 2020 , without any preparation or consultation from various departments and ministries , when India had less than 600 cases and nine people died of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n1.3 billion population was given only four hours to prepare for the heavy disruption in their lives including restriction on their mobility and complete cessation of economic activities .\nIn order to explain as to why the government imposed the nationwide lockdown on merely four hours notice , it is being explained that this step was taken on the ` recommendation of experts \u2019 and after ` taking into account the global experience \u2019 to prevent the danger of spread of coronavirus .\n( Azam .\n2020 ) The Oxford University tracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 has identified India \u2019 s response as one of the most stringent in the world .\n( India Today , 2020 ) Other scholars have termed it as a punitive and a draconian lockdown .\n( Ray and Subramanian , 2020 ) However , as soon as the lockdown was announced , millions of poor men , women and children started walking from the cities to their hometowns defying the appeal made by the Prime Minister on the national television .\nThese workers took to roads while fleeing cities and cowering police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger and fatigue .\n( Nigam , 2020 c ) .\nSome squeezed themselves in container trucks while others walked .\nThese informal workers are backbone of economy as they construct buildings and flyovers , cook food , serve in eateries , salons , automobiles , and do other odd jobs to earn meagerly to sustain themselves in the city .\nHowever , the state did little to help these desperate citizens .\nThe arrangements for food and the transport was done after much delay and not all those moving

@ @ @ @ on the migrant workers , others were beaten by the police , but that could not deter them to try all possible ways to return to their home .\nThe mass exodus also happened earlier in 1918 when the Spanish flu gripped the world .\nAt that point of time , the British rulers were hardly concerned about the health or the economy of the colonial India , however , this time too , the state has

Parliament it is claimed that no data is available on the death of migrant workers ( The Indian Express 2020 ) though some organizations documented 971 non-COVID deaths of workers during the lockdown .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 989 deaths occurred due to the financial distress , exhaustion , train and road accidents , suicides due to fear , absence of facilities , police brutality and so on .\n(

that of millions of other families who have been devastated during the lockdown .\nThe Supreme Court , too ignored the ` crisis within crisis \u2019 of the migrant workers during the pandemic because of the omission of the government to prepare for the lockdown .\nIt is being observed that in the darkest hour , the fundamental rights of the vulnerable citizens , that constitute more than 70

.\nMoreover , the jobs move away from high labor productive sectors such as manufacturing and services to low productivity sectors such as agriculture and construction ( The Economic Times , 2021 ) .\nAnother research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians out of the middle class ( those earning 10 to 20 $ a day ) leading to sharper rise in poverty while undoing years of economic gains ( NDTV , 2021 ) .\nIt is estimated that the number of poor people with income of less than 2 $ or less each day has gone up by 75 million due to the recession induced by the pandemic .\nAs a result , those on the brink , not only suffered due to government \u2019 s inaction but are being pushed further beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic rather it pushed for tough reforms and attempts are made to crush and muzzle any resistance from the citizens .\nDuring the pre-pandemic period too , the government has been pushing for tough economic reforms .\nThe measures such demonetization and GST has already crumpled and weakened the economy .\nThe imposition of stringent lockdown further made adverse impacts .\n( Kumar A , 2020 ) During the lockdown , hunger and unemployment rise rapidly .\nThe Food Corporation of India had four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontinued the supply of food grains through Public Distribution System in November 2020 .\n( Narayanan , 2021 ) The post pandemic recovery approach ignored the plight of the citizens as evident by the lesser allocations towards social safety programs such as reducing the expenditure on the Rural Employment Guarantee Act by 73,000 crores , leading to increasing stress for the bottom pyramid of population .\nAlso , the government scrapped 3 crores ration cards for not linking it with Aadhaar card denying common people their basic right to food as ensured under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NDTV , 2021 ) Instead of mitigating the impact of lockdown , the government initiated a series of reforms in the labour and the agriculture sector without consultation or debate from various stakeholders .\nThese reforms aimed at increasing flexibility and supporting the employers and corporates rather than protecting the rights of the farmers or workers .\nPushing such economic reforms is creating chaos .\n( Jha 2021 ) It is during the lockdown that the farmers began their agitation against the three farm laws enacted by the state to liberalize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( Jain RK and V Suresh , 2021 ) Instead of addressing the agrarian crisis or resolving the issues relating to farmers \u2019 debt or suicide , or providing safety nets to protect the rights of farmers , the state pushed the neoliberal agenda to empower the market .\nIn September , 2020 while laying siege to the malls , the farmers cordoned the godowns belonging to the corporates , occupied the railway tracks and burned the effigies of the Prime Minister and the corporate bigwigs .\n( Ziya , 2021 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of farmers rode on tractors , bikes , cars and trucks to start an indefinite sit-in in the capital .\nWhen prevented from reaching Delhi , they camped themselves at the borders of the capital .\nThe state though engaged with the

concertina wires .\nIron lances and maces were mixed with cement were put up blocking the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also obstructed the process of negotiations .\nWater connection , toilet facilities and internet were blocked at the protest sites , social media was censored while draconian laws were used against the protestors while demonizing them .\nThe protestors were dubbed as separatists , secessionists , paid protestors or Khalistanis .\nThe international celebrities who tweeted in support of the protest were slammed whereas the international diplomats have been rebuked by the Indian government ( BBC , 2021b ) .\nMultiple petitions have been filed in the courts to remove the protestors projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to public convenience ( Chaturvedi , 2020 ) rather than actually addressing the true causes for which the protestors raised their voice .\nAs I write , the protest has completed almost four months , yet a breakthrough remained elusive .\nHowever , during this period , the protest that began with a group of farmers slowly is emerging as a mass struggleresonating across villages , chaupals and tea stalls ( Khan , 2021 ) .\nIt is gaining momentum with many students and workers joining and extending their support .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ terming these developments as a satyagraha .\n( The Conversation , 2021 ) The omissions and commissions by the government besides its dereliction of duties has caused much anguish among citizens \u2013 for some it entails loss of lives due to non-COVID reasons , others faced extreme starvation , debt , loss of livelihood , stress , atrocities of various kinds committed on them by police and administration in the garb of compliance of lockdown norms .\nThe past year shows that government is at the war with its own citizens , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scrap citizenship laws , the migrant workers who walked miles as soon as lockdown was imposed or the farmers who are continuing to protest against the farm laws .\nThe state is adamant of not only dissecting the existing citizenship matrix denying the citizens their rights , but it is also pushing the neoliberal reforms guaranteeing the domination of the market .\nWorld over , the research shows that the economic liberalization has not guaranteed efficiency , rights or protection to the marginalized groups .\nInstead , economic approach that promotes massive

called for the state authorities to protect the basic rights of the citizens to protest .\n( The Amnesty International , 2021 ) Yet , at the local and the national level , the dissent is growing stronger .\nThe creative non-violent resistance at the ground level is paving the way for the independent journalism ( DW.com , 2021 ) reviving the brotherhood or ` @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim communities in western Uttar Pradesh where for decades the electoral politics has utilized the divide and disharmony to its vested interest , garnering international attention ( UN News , 2021 , The Hindustan Times

decades ( Bhowmick and Sonthalia , 2021 ) In fact , hassled with the protests and different forms of resistance by the citizens , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much democracy \u2019 is making the tough reforms difficult .\nA year of pandemic shows that more than a medical calamity , the crisis is humanitarian and arose because the fascist state is pushing the neoliberal agenda behind the garb of the lockdown .\nThe lockdown has provided an opportunity to the authoritarian state to utilize its repressive apparatus to deny common people of their rights while consolidating power relationship with the rich corporates .\nThe V-Dem Institute and the Freedom House both have downgraded the world \u2019 s largest democracy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the abuse of power by the state , the masses are not blindly following the traps laid down by the corporate controlled media and are resisting to save the democratic ideals .\nThe mass mobilization during the lockdown as evident by the farmers \u2019 protest against the ruling regime has re-kindled a heated debate on several issues such as survival with dignity , culture , corruption , identity , federalism , dissent , democracy and more importantly the ` idea of India \u2019 .\nThe continuous resilience and resistance by the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uphold the constitutional values are igniting change , depicting the power of the people and is indicating towards the strength of democracy as imagined by the makers of the constitution .\nThe citizens driven dissent against the citizenship laws , the social movement by the farmers , or the defiance by the workers who walked thousands of miles , all are the part of articulation of disagreement with the arbitrary laws and the policies of the government by the common citizens .\nWhether the demands being made by the protestors crystalize into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that these protests are initiating a debate and are heightening the political consciousness that is critical to functioning of democracy .\nThe ruling regime may arbitrarily enact the anti-people laws in haste , however the citizens are mobilizing and challenging those in power .\nThese acts of resistance against neoliberalism as well as against nationalist communalism depict solidarity among subalterns that is essential to build a cohesive society in the post-COVID world .\nLooking beyond

reduced access to safe drinking water has led to difficulty in maintaining cultural practices which have helped devastate riverine environments and wetlands .\nAcross 10 catchments in the New South

disputes in India has been that these should be resolved as soon as possible so that the many-sided potential of various river-valley projects can be realized as early as possible by taking up the

@ @ @ @ @ Cold War preparations already underway as early as August 1945 and likely much earlier , and that the two regions selected , Korea and Vietnam , were pre-planned five years in advance and the other ten years in advance respectively , before the actual wars were to take place .\nWhat this means is that the official narrative for why the Korean War and the Vietnam War were fought are fabrications of the Cold War \u201c reality.\n\u201d Therefore , it should be asked , what was the real reason that Americans entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading figures among the American elite , many who were so adamant on not joining in the combat against fascism in WWII , become so quickly convinced , that everything having to do with communism , was their personal responsibility to destroy ?\nThese questions will be answered in this series titled \u201c The Fascist Roots of the CIA.\n\u201d The CIA and the Pentagon : A Tale of Two Star Crossed Lovers As discussed in part one of this series , with the Eisenhower-Nixon victory in 1952 , the culmination of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power brokers , the new heads of the State Department and the CIA were selected as none other than Foster and Allen Dulles respectively ; and they would go on to direct the global operations of the most powerful nation in the world .\nIt is for this reason that the 1952 presidential election has gone down in history as the triumph of \u201c the power elite.\n\u201d The entire period of April 12th 1945 to that fateful Election Day can be best understood as the first stage of America \u2019 s coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of 1945 and 1949 , when a number of new pieces of legislation were passed which successfully reorganised the departments within the United States such that much of the government and military decisions would be beholden to the authority of a few men , men who were much more powerful than the president himself .\nThe National Security Act of 1947 , a Trojan horse , was one of the first of this new breed of legislation and led to the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency , placing it under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it did not explicitly authorize the CIA to conduct covert operations , Section 102 was sufficiently vague to permit abuse .\nBy December 1947 , ( less than four months after the creation of the CIA ) , the perceived necessity to \u201c stem the flow of communism \u201d in Western Europe\u2014particularly Italy\u2014by overt and covert \u201c psychological warfare \u201d forced the issue and NSC 4-A was born .\nNSC 4-A was a new directive to cover \u201c clandestine paramilitary operations , as well as political and economic warfare , \u201d this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA in the Italian elections of April 1948 .\nIt was understood that the U.S. military could have no \u201c direct \u201d role in covert operations , since that would defeat the purpose of deniability .\nThe Communist Party of Italy , admired for leading the fight against Mussolini , was expected to win in Italy \u2019 s first post-war election .\nThis , of course , was considered intolerable under the Iron Curtain diktat and American covert operations were deployed to block the anti-fascist victory .\nInvestigative journalist Christopher Simpson writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a substantial part of this funding came from captured Nazi assets .\nThis intervention , according to Simpson , tipped the balance in favour of Italy \u2019 s Christian Democrats Party , which hid thousands of fascists in its ranks .\nIn just a few months from its creation , the CIA went from what was supposed to be a civilian intelligence gathering arm of the government to being responsible for covert operations including \u201c psychological warfare.\n\u201d This was a far cry from what had organised the United States prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian army .\nSuch a government mandate for cloak and dagger operations during a time of peace would have been considered unthinkable .\nBut that is why the Cold War narrative was so imperative , since under this paranoid schizophrenic nightmare , it was thought the world would never be at peace until a significant portion of it was wiped out .\nThe Cold War defined a pixelated enemy that was under-defined and invisible to the eye .\nThe enemy was what your superiors told you were the enemy , and like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including your neighbour , your colleague , your partner\u2026even the president .\nThere would always be an enemy , because there would always be people who would resist the Grand Strategy .\nNSC 4-A was replaced by NSC 10/2 , approved by President Truman on June 18th 1948 , creating the Office of Policy Coordination ( OPC ) .\nNSC 10/2 was the first presidential document which specified a mechanism to approve and manage covert operations , and also the first in which the term \u201c covert operations \u201d was defined .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA \u2019 s control , but rather was a renegade operation run by Allen Dulles .\nOPC was brought under CIA control in October 1950 , when Walter Bedell Smith became Director of Central Intelligence , and it was renamed the Directorate of Plans .\nAlthough the CIA was strictly in charge of covert operations , it often needed the military for additional personnel , transport , overseas bases , weapons , aircraft , ships , and all the other things the Department of Defense had in abundance .\nIn reality , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , found itself forever in the embrace of its toxic lover , the CIA .\nOn Sept. 2nd , 1945 , Ho Chi Minh signed the Declaration of Independence for a new nation , the Democratic Republic of Vietnam , which stated the following lines : Ho Chi Minh had been leading the nationalist Viet Minh independence movement since 1941 against the colonial rule of Japan .\nLike most of the world , Ho Chi Minh viewed the war against the fascists as aligned to a war against imperialism .\nHe believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a stand against such tyranny , than there would be no place for colonialism in the post-war world .\nThe world would have to be organised according to the recognition and respect of independent nation states , along the lines of Roosevelt \u2019 s post-war vision .\nAfter a long and horrific battle against the ruthless Japanese fascists , with support during the war from the United States and China , it was the hope of Ho Chi Minh that Vietnam could return to its former days of peace with its new-found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had surrendered and were leaving .\nThe French had been defeated by the Japanese and would not return\u2014or so it was thought .\nVo Nguyen Giap , Ho Chi Minh \u2019 s brilliant military commander , while serving as Minister of the Interior of the provisional government , delivered a speech describing the United States as a good friend of the Viet Minh .\nThat , too , was in September 1945 .\nHo Chi Minh had been supplied with a tremendous stock of military equipment by the United States , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new government in Vietnam without further opposition .\nBut on September 23 , 1945 , shortly after the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had issued its Declaration of Independence , a group of former French troops , acting with the consent of the British forces ( who had been given jurisdiction of the area from the Potsdam Conference ) and armed with Japanese weapons stolen from surrender stockpiles , staged a local coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat and seized control of the administration of Saigon , in South Vietnam , known today as Ho Chi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French had assumed all military commitments in Vietnam and reinstalled the French government .\nIt should be understood that the removal of the French presence in Indochina was no small feat , since it was not only their military presence that had to be dealt with , but also its business interests including French banks , among the most powerful in Asia .\nThe French had imposed its colonial presence in Indochina since 1787 .\nNegotiations between the French and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam began early in 1946 .\nHo Chi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference failed due to French intransigence .\nThe French Indochina War broke out in 1946 and went on for eight years , with France \u2019 s war effort largely funded and supplied by the United States .\nIn 1949 , Bao Dai , the former emperor who spent most of his time in the lap of luxury in Paris , France , was set up by foreign interest to be the puppet government of the State of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) .\nOn May 8 , 1950 , Secretary of State Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give both economic and military aid to France and to the State of Vietnam .\nThe value of this military assistance surpassed $ 3 billion .\nThere was never any official reason for why the United States changed its allegiance from Ho Chi Minh to the French colonial interests and their puppet government .\nAlthough Ho Chi Minh \u2019 s belief in communism was used to justify this betrayal , the truth was that he was a threat because he considered himself first and foremost a nationalist , who believed that the Vietnamese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved independence from colonial dominance .\nIt was this nationalism that could not be tolerated in areas of the world which were regarded as imperial territories and subject lands .\nIt is for this very same reason that MI6 and the CIA staged a coup against the beloved nationalist Mosaddegh in Iran , a non-communist who held a Ph.D. in law and was well on his way to removing all British imperial claims on oil in the country after winning his case against the British at the Hague and at the UN Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interests of imperialism and fascism were often linked hand in hand , as seen with Edward VIII ( though he was not alone in the British Royal family in his views ) , the Vichy government in France , King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III who appointed Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister in 1922 ( who only deposed Mussolini in 1943 when it was clear they were going to lose the war ) and Imperial Japan under Emperor Hirohito .\nIt is for this reason that we saw , before WWII was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascists in discussion with each other as to what would form the post-war world .\nIt is for this reason that the countries chosen to oversee this Grand Strategy would be the U.S. , Britain , France , Germany and Japan , rather than Roosevelt \u2019 s choice of the U.S. , Russia , Britain and China .\nIt is for this reason that the Iron Curtain , that was originally announced , not by Churchill but rather by German Foreign Minister Count Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk , reported in the London Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to announce the terms of an indefinite war against communism .\nIn reality , it meant any country opposed to imperial rule , opposed to the idea that some were born to rule and others to be ruled , in other words , imperialism and sovereign nation states could not co-exist .\nHo Chi Minh was an ally to the Americans under the leadership of Roosevelt .\nHowever , with Roosevelt \u2019 s death and the soft coup that followed , Ho Chi Minh was now an enemy .\nOn January 8 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Security Council , President Eisenhower made his views clear that Americans did not belong in the Vietnam War .\nBut that did not really matter .\nEisenhower , who was used to people diligently following his line of command as a General of WWII , was soon to learn that this did not apply as President of the United States .\nAmong those at the January 8 , 1954 meeting of the National Security Council were Allen W. Dulles and his brother John Foster Dulles .\nThere was no way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Eisenhower .\nYet , on January 14 , 1954 , only six days after the President \u2019 s \u201c vehement \u201d statement against the entry of U.S. armed forces in Indochina , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said : Thus , the seed was planted .\nIf the French were forced out , which was rather predictable , it was understood that the U.S. would not engage in open warfare with the Viet Minh .\nHowever , it could carry out clandestine operations against Ho Chi Minh \u2019 s forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the words of Foster Dulles \u201c to raise hell.\n\u201d This is how American intervention and direct involvement in the Vietnam War began , a war in which the Americans had been arming both sides since 1945 and to which there was no official military objective except \u201c to raise hell.\n\u201d According to a record of the January 14 , 1954 National Security Council meeting , it was : And , just like that , the entire overseeing of the Vietnam War was placed into the hands of the Dulles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 29 , Allen Dulles , selected Colonel Lansdale to head the team that was going to be deployed in Vietnam \u201c to raise hell.\n\u201d Edward G. Lansdale , chief of the Saigon Military Mission , arrived in Saigon on June 1 , 1954 , less than one month after the defeat of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu , for the purpose of a covert operation to conduct psychological warfare and paramilitary activities in South Vietnam .\nIt should be noted here that although NSC and Department of State records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not begin until January 1954 , there were other CIA activities in Vietnam , Cambodia , and Laos ( such as the White Cloud teams ) long before 1954 , and some members of the SMM had participated in these earlier activities as far back as 1945 .\n( 1 ) Though Lansdale is listed as a U.S. Air Force Col. who was put in charge of the SMM , this was just a ploy .\nHe would continue in Vietnam , as he had in the Philippines , to exploit the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assigned to the Military Assistance Advisory Group ( MAAG ) for \u201c cover assignment \u2019 \u2019 purposes .\nHe was always an agent of the CIA , and his actual bosses were always with the CIA .\nWith Ho Chi Minh \u2019 s defeat of the French in 1954 at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu , ending the First Indochina War , it was understood that new oppositional leadership would be required if Ho Chi Minh were to be prevented from taking control of South Vietnam .\nNgo Dinh Diem would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote in 1955 , becoming the first President of the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) .\nThe South Vietnamese were not interested in either candidate .\nThe reader should take note here that South Vietnam ( otherwise known as Cochinchina for centuries ) , had never had a real form of government because it had never been a nation in its entire existence but rather had been made up of ancient villages for several centuries with relatively little change .\nThere was no congress , no police , and no tax-system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation .\nDiem \u2019 s \u201c government \u201d was nothing but a fa\u00e7ade of bureaucracy .\nDespite this , Diem \u2019 s Republic of Vietnam was treated as an equal member of the family of nations , as if it could stand on its own two feet and respond accordingly to the crisis its people were being thrown into .\nThe Vietnamese government that Eisenhower believed ought to be fighting the Viet Minh on its own behalf did not exist .\nThe choice of a predominant number of Indochinese was overwhelmingly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to Bao Dai , who lived in Paris , and they hated the French .\nNgo Dinh Diem was a nobody , who never accomplished anything to win the hearts of his people .\nThe Vietnam War , as it understood today , was full of oversights .\nBut perhaps the most serious oversight of all was that not one of the six U.S. administrations who oversaw the Vietnam War ever stated a positive American military objective for that war .\nThe generals sent to Saigon were told not to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period .\nAs Prouty stated repeatedly in his book , this does not constitute a military objective .\nThe Saigon Military Mission was sent to Vietnam to preside over the dissolution of French colonial power .\nThe Dulles brothers knew , by January 1954 if not long before that , that they would be creating a new Vietnamese government that would be neither French nor Vietminh and that this new government would then become the base for continuing the decade-old war in Indochina .\nThat was their primary objective .\nThe defeat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July 1954 which established the 17th parallel as a temporary demarcation line separating the military forces of the French and the Viet Minh .\nWithin 300 days of the signing of the accords , a demilitarized zone , or DMZ , was created , and the transfer of any civilians who wished to leave either side was to be completed .\nHo Chi Minh and all northern Vietnamese believed the nation to be \u201c one.\n\u201d They did not want a division of their country , as the Geneva Agreements had guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agreements , Number 14 , a scarcely noticed few lines , read ; \u201c \u2026any civilians residing in a district controlled by one party , who wish to go and live in the zone assigned to the other party , shall be permitted and helped to do so by the authorities in that district.\n\u201d The ominous meaning of this was concealed under the guise of humanitarian words .\nThe American-British note spoke of a \u201c peaceful and humane transfer , \u201d as if they were being kind and sensitive to the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had lived all their lives in a settled village that had existed for tens of thousands of years .\nThe people of the world , most of whom had no knowledge of the Tonkinese , were led to believe that this offer was a most compassionate gesture .\nAnd , what is worse , the planners of this sinister plot were certain that the people of the world would never learn the truth , that this movement of one million North Vietnamese was really intended to be the kindling that would set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set-up and would lay the essential groundwork for America \u2019 s direct entry into the war .\nThe mass exodus of North Vietnamese to South Vietnam would be orchestrated by the Saigon Military Mission .\nThis was a terrible upheaval for these people but it was sold to the West as if they were refugees fleeing Ho Chi Minh .\nIn reality , they were fleeing the \u201c psychological warfare \u201d and \u201c paramilitary tactics \u201d today called \u201c terrorism \u201d that the SMM were unleashing in these small Northern villages .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in documents released with the Pentagon Papers , leaders of the SMM wrote that the mission had been sent into North Vietnam to carry out \u201c unconventional warfare , \u201d \u201c paramilitary operations , \u201d \u201c political-psychological warfare , \u201d and rumor campaigns and to set up a Combat Psy War course for the Vietnamese .\nThe members of the SMM were classic \u201c agents provocateurs.\n\u201d It didn \u2019 t take long before the disturbance caused by the Diem-favored northern intruders onto the southern natives broke out into violence .\nBefore long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to

.\nMeanwhile , in July 2020 Touch Soeun awoke each morning in fear that the bulldozers would return .\nThe month prior , a fleet of bulldozers flanked by local authorities and police officers arrived to inform him that the Boeung Chhouk A village \u2013 a small hamlet in northern Phnom Penh \u2013 was illegally occupying land that was owned by an unnamed property developer .\nTouch Soeun gazes at his land , which was cleared without his consent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBy that time , six houses had been torn down and one homeowner had had a heart attack as the bulldozers tore through his home , according to Soeun .\nBut now Soeun said that the remaining 22 families of Boeung Chhouk A live in limbo .\nAs of March 2021 , his community \u2019 s case has not moved forwards and the authorities maintain they are illegally occupying the land , but would be compensated if they left .\nKimsrour and Soeun \u2019 s stories are all too common in Cambodia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights ( FIDH ) in 2014 estimated that at least 770,000 people had been affected by land grabs that cover some 4 million hectares of land \u2013 145,000 of them in Phnom Penh alone .\nThe well-documented politicization of Cambodia \u2019 s judiciary has rendered justice elusive and land disputes \u2013 as frequent as they are \u2013 rarely even make it to court .\nBut FIDH aims to bring a case against land grabbing to the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) in The Hague .\nFIDH , along with Global Witness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated March 16 to Fatou Bensouda , the current prosecutor at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , urging her to open a preliminary examination into land-grabbing in Cambodia .\nWhile FIDH , Global Witness and Climate Counsel began the process in October 2014 , when the first communication was sent to the Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC \u2013 which was followed up by a second in July 2015 \u2013 progress has remained slow .\nBut FIDH \u2019 s latest letter suggested that a decision will be made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor on June 15 , 2021 .\nThe Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC did not respond to requests for comment on the matter , but a December 2020 report on Preliminary Examination Activities stated that Bensouda \u2019 s office will send responses to communications that warrant further analysis this year , including the case of land grabbing in Cambodia .\nIndeed , on Feb. 17 , Bensouda delivered a keynote speech at the Institute of International & European Affairs where she again confirmed that a decision would be made on Cambodia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2021 .\nCautious optimism among those seeking justice for land grabs in Cambodia was somewhat renewed following the publication of a policy paper by the ICC on Sept. 15 , 2016 that effectively broadened its processes for selecting and prioritizing cases .\nThis being said , Giorgetta was quick to point out that the ICC has not expanded its mandate and the Office of the Prosecutor is still only able to investigate crimes that full under the Rome Statute .\nRather , the court could prioritize cases where currently listed crimes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural resources or the illegal acquisition of land .\nThere had been hope , both among the ICC and the NGOs involved , that the submission of communications to the Office of the Prosecutor alone would have had some impact and altered the behavior of those involved in land grabs across Cambodia ; but as Giorgetta observed , this hasn \u2019 t been the case .\nTouch Soeun \u2019 s home , where trees once stood .\nImage by Gerald Flynn .\nWhen asked for comment on the potential for land grabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson for the Ministry of Environment Neth Pheaktra said he wasn \u2019 t the right person to speak to .\nSeng Lot , spokesperson for the Ministry of Land Management could not be reached for comment and holds a reputation \u2013 even among government-owned media in Cambodia \u2013 for never speaking publicly .\nLikewise government spokesperson Phay Siphan declined to comment on how the government was feeling about the ICC \u2019 s progress , as did Cambodian People \u2019 s Party ( CPP ) spokesperson Sok Eysan , Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Koy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tha .\nAs such , it \u2019 s impossible to know whether anyone within Prime Minister Hun Sen \u2019 s administration is especially concerned about being targeted for involvement in land grabs , but as Giorgetta noted , the government has previously buckled slightly at the prospect of international sanctions .\nLand ownership has long been a sensitive social issue in Cambodia after the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime abolished land titles \u2013 a move that would lead to surviving land titles being voided in the 1980s , but the value of land concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed Cambodia for much of the 1990s .\nBetween 1991 and 1997 , the government allocated some 7 million hectares of land as forest concessions as various political factions sought to fund their bids for supremacy in the wake of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia mission .\nWhile people like Kimsrour and Soeun settled on Phnom Penh \u2019 s outskirts in 1995 , the Land Management Ministry didn \u2019 t even exist until 1999 and the 1992 version of Cambodia \u2019 s Land Law suffered from weak-to-no enforcement until its 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of international donors to issue land titles in 1995 , the World Bank in 2001 estimated that 80 % of Cambodia \u2019 s land area was deemed property of the state and as few as 600,000 of the 4 million applications for land titles had been processed .\nBy 2010 , the United Nations Capital Development Fund found that 30 % of Cambodia \u2019 s land was owned by just 1 % of the population , largely due to the 2001 amendments to the Land Law that made possible the conversion of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land to be sold if certain criteria were met .\nSome 400 Cambodians travelled from three provinces to Phnom Penh on Sept. 22 , 2020 to protest outside the Ministry of Land Management over unresolved land disputes \u2013 many of which had arisen from the government allegedly reclaiming people \u2019 s land .\nA protest against land-grabbing held in front of the Land Management Ministry in September , 2020 .\nImage by Gerald Flynn .\nVuthy said land grabs are justified by the government as land concessions , housing developments or infrastructure projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea until construction \u2013 or demolition \u2013 begins .\nHe said that justice in these cases is both rare and slow .\nLand disputes that arose in 2010 over sugar plantations in Oddar Meanchey , Koh Kong , Kampong Speu and Preah Vihear provinces remain unsolved .\nOf the 700 families affected in Oddar Meanchey province , Vuthy said that fewer than half had received a 2-hectare plot of land in compensation , while more than 1,000 families were given 1.5-hectare plots in Koh Kong province .\nIn both cases the relocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of the community , he added .\nVuthy said that even those solutions haven \u2019 t been offered to the 2,130 families in Kampong Speu and Preah Vihear who lost their land to sugar companies owned by or connected to Ly Yong Phat \u2013 a wealthy and powerful CPP senator .\nSimilarly , in Ratanakiri province , Vietnamese rubber giant HAGL has been accused of illegally clearing the sacred land of some 2,000 indigenous families .\nIndigenous communities are more adversely affected by land grabs , Vuthy said , because the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their livelihoods , and they are even less likely to be afforded justice than ethnically Khmer victims .\nOne element that remains absent from communications sent to the ICC regarding land grabbing in Cambodia is the intrinsic relationship between the illegal acquisition of land and environmental degradation .\nThis is an issue that the ICC has also pledged to address , according to the 2016 policy paper and as recently as December 2020 , when international lawyer Philippe Sands and Florence Mumba \u2013 a judge at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definition of ecocide to be included on the list of international crimes that includes such atrocities as genocide and crimes against humanity .\nTheir definition is expected early this year and could mean perpetrators of environmental destruction could be brought to international justice .\nSpeaking at a webinar hosted by the Center for Khmer Studies on March 12 , Work said that the flurry of land concessions that the Cambodian government handed out in the 2000s resulted in widespread environmental destruction .\nShe referenced a Cambodian saying : while Khmer Rouge leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments \u2013 much of which Work linked to land concessions \u2013 are killing everything else .\nOne area of interest for Work is Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary , where rampant logging has been

imagery from Planet Labs and Sentinel 2B shows recent large-scale deforestation of primary forest inside Think Biotech \u2019 s timber concession , which abuts Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary .\nWork \u2019 s research in Cambodia began in 2009 and has covered the social and ecological consequences of land concessions in their many forms across Cambodia , including Pursat , Kampong Chhnang , Kampong Speu and Stung Treng provinces , where the dispossession of land and destruction of the environment remained pegged to the economic land concessions granted in each province .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ land concessions , an initiative introduced by the World Bank that was designed to ensure land tenure for Cambodia \u2019 s growing landless population .\nBut rights activists warn that this , like almost all well-intentioned programs pertaining to land titling , has been bastardized .\nReports from local land rights advocates suggest that social land concessions are not only being used instead of proper compensation mechanisms for communities who \u2019 ve been evicted in the wake of land grabs , but have even been abused to provide land to military officials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local authorities .\nAs recently as June last year , the World Bank announced another $ 93 million would go to fund the third phase of its land tenure project in Cambodia , despite mounting allegations of abuse within the system that has led critics to accuse the World Bank of being complicit in land grabbing and the environmental damage it has caused .\nRepresentatives of the World Bank in Cambodia said that they were \u201c not aware of serious issues with the land allocated through the LASED projects \u201d adding that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had prompted increased funding for the third phase .\nThe first two phases of LASED have so far cost $ 39.86 million and have been running since 2008 \u2013 LASED III is set to run from 2021 to 2026 and will bring the total cost to $ 146.8 million \u2013 but so far just 17,000 hectares have been allocated to 5,091 previously landless families .\nOf them , only 3,362 land titles have been issued , meaning the World Bank has spent nearly $ 12,000 for each land title acquired .\nOn March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ecosystem Accounting framework , which aims to attach a dollar value to ecosystems in a bid to help preserve them .\nThe Cambodian government reportedly requested the World Bank provide economic data to support a decision to preserve 65 % of Cambodia \u2019 s forests .\nThe analysis found that economic gains from preserving forests were five times higher than cutting them down for charcoal production or agriculture and that other sectors linked to forest ecosystems would benefit by as much as 20 times more than the cost of maintaining the forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pheapimex Group concession near Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary .\nSatellite imagery shows recently burned areas of primary forest in another area outside the Pheapimex concession .\nAccording to data from U.S. space agency NASA , fire activity began in the concession .\nBut critics remain unconvinced by the World Bank \u2019 s motives and are skeptical of even the ICC \u2019 s ability to stimulate change in Cambodia \u2019 s relationship with conservation .\nShe added that so far the government hasn \u2019 t changed their response to any form of

Mujibur Rahman .\nWith a military government ruling over Bangladesh , either directly or as proxy for the next 15 years , conservative Islamic views became more central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much so that in 1979 , secularism was removed from the Bangladeshi constitution .\nIn 1988 , Islam was made the official state religion .\nThe number of state-sanctioned Islamic schools ( madrasas ) increased exponentially , from 1,830 in 1975 to 5,793 in 1990 .\nBut the biggest radical change in the country came in the 1980 \u2019 s when U.S.-backed Bangladeshi mujahideens returned from their anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan .\nThese veterans sought to transplant Saudi-sponsored Taliban-styled Islam to Bangladesh .\nAlthough Sheikh Hasina won the 2008 elections and restored secularism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains an Islamic Republic .\nThe Islamists do not win votes in elections but instead exert considerable societal and cultural power through madrassas , banks and other institutions .\nIn the last decade , Bangladesh \u2019 s Islamists have resorted to street power to mobilize against secularism .\nIn February 2013 , when top Islamist leaders were convicted of war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladeshi Liberation Struggle , one of main figures was given what the moderates considered a light sentence .\nA campaign began to demand his execution , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Hefazat .\nAs many as 500,000 people shut down major roads to the capital and interpreted the protesters demands as defaming their religion and Muhammad , the founder of Islam .\nThe fact that Pakistani-backed Islamist militias killed hundreds of thousands of people during the Liberation Struggle was ignored by Hefazat .\nIn a 13-point list , Hefazat demanded the death penalty for blasphemy and an end to Bangladesh \u2019 s education policy that they say prioritizes \u201c secular \u201d subjects like science and math over religious studies .\nTo appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet some of their demands , including an expansion on the government \u2019 s ability to crack down on those who \u201c hurt religious beliefs \u201d and for \u201c acts of defamation.\n\u201d Under this revised law , Bangladesh has arrested at least eight bloggers since 2013 for writing articles critical of the Saudi government and posting derogatory remarks about the founder of Islam .\nPolice have used the defamation clause of the Information and Communication Technology Act and its replacement , the Digital Security Act of 2018 , to silence criticism against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over 1,200 people were charged under this law .\nBangladeshi preachers also aspire to shape society according to their interpretations of what constitutes \u201c pure \u201d Islam .\nPopular Islamic televangelists reach millions of people across the Muslim world , spreading the notion that Islam in the Indian subcontinent must be \u201c purified \u201d of non-Arab elements , ie .\nof all Indo influences .\nAn example

was willingly doing so last week , and found himself indignant at the merciless cuts to courses and subjects in Australian universities .\nHe was particularly worried about what was happening at the University of Melbourne , which is removing various subjects in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset programme \u201d .\nHis sombre words were recorded in The Age : \u201c If we are serious about tackling climate change with technology , if we are serious about preventing more pandemics , then research and the study of science of technology need to be right up there as a national priority and properly funded.\n\u201d Australia risked \u201c becoming the bogans of the Pacific.\n\u201d A touch harsh , perhaps , given that \u201c bogan \u201d is a word defined in the Australian National Dictionary as \u201c an uncultured and unsophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c uncouth \u201d .\nBut both meaning and consequence are clear enough .\nAustralian teaching and research institutions are being ravaged by the razor ready commissars of administration who cite one alibi for their hazardous conduct : the pandemic .\nLittle time is spent on focusing on why the Australian university sector , bloated as it is , began to cannibalise funding and focus on single markets , such as that of China , sacrificing , along the way , standards .\nThe approach by the University of Melbourne is a template of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 200 professors who sit on the academic board issued a warning at the imminent loss of 450 jobs .\nThe letter to Vice-Chancellor Duncan Maskell warned that the pandemic restructure plan was destined to \u201c damage our capacity to deliver on our public purposes in the short and long term \u201d .\nThe University risked engendering distrust and damaging morale , harming \u201c our reputation as a preeminent university , both nationally and globally.\n\u201d A university spokesman at the time brought out the usual , meaningless formulae one has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroider the message with caution ; second , celebrate the institution you promise to ransack ; third , claim that the ransacking will actually do it good in the future .\nThe institution was taking a \u201c considered and rational approach to critical decisions that must be made during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure it continues to be Australia \u2019 s leading university that is focused on outstanding teaching and research , not just for today but well into the future \u201d .\nJust to show how rational and considered these bureaucratic wonks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such important parts of the university as the Veterinary School \u2019 s teaching hospital at Werribee .\nIn an effort both futile but necessary , staff and supporters of the hospital tried to put their case to John Fazakerley , Dean of Veterinary and Agricultural Science .\n\u201c The university \u2019 s Pandemic Reset Programme proposals do not recognise the correlation between skilled professional staff and teaching in a hospital that provides a high standard of care.\n\u201d Did they ever ?\nOther sectors in the university are also being given more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 209 voluntary redundancies , a cheery form of remunerated

safety , facilities management , research outputs and post-award finance support .\n( That \u2019 s bureaucracy for you . )\nWhat is particularly stinging to Doherty , however , is the move to torch specific subjects and make various positions redundant .\nStaff at Melbourne University have been told that subjects with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include physical cosmology , quantum field theory and advanced environmental computation .\nIn all , 11 units in chemistry , physics , biology and earth science risk being discontinued or suspended .\nSenior teaching positions in the fields of genetics , chemistry and biosciences will be made redundant .\nOffice staff and lab technicians also find themselves in this mess .\nThe assault on science teaching and research is not merely the work of the surfeit barbarians in the chancellery .\nAustralian higher education is imperilled , not merely by a university management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff into oblivion but a Federal Parliament that sees little value in them .\nA country facing the sharper side of climate change , brutal weather , environmental destruction and energy crises would be expected to be pouring money into degrees directed towards their study .\nBut scientific illiteracy , along with other forms , is as contagious as the novel coronavirus .\nIn October 2020 , changes made to higher education with the blessing of the Centre

page ( Desktop version ) .\nAbstract : Drawing on Japanese press and TV reports , the authors explain the extraordinary costs of the decade long cleanup of the 3.11 earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear meltdown , with no end to the process in sight .\nMany of the Japanese print and broadcast features related to the 10th anniversary of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami addressed the current circumstances of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how difficult it has been to move on , especially for those who lost loved ones .\nAmong these stories was one that stood out like a rusty nail , since it covered a less sympathetic response to the crisis : greed .\nA three-part series in the Asahi Shimbun focused on the city of Tamura in Fukushima prefecture , in particular a highland district called Utsushi-chiku with about 1,850 residents , mainly tobacco farmers .\nAfter a hydrogen explosion occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on March 12 , 2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ordered to since Utsushi-chiku was outside the mandatory 20-kilometer evacuation zone .\nHowever , the government restricted the distribution of crops grown in the area , so agriculture was halted and the residents became worried about their livelihoods .\nThen in the autumn the government allocated about \u00a54 trillion to some 100 local governments to clean up the radiation that contaminated much of the area .\nAs part of this work , residents of Utsushi-chiku were recruited to remove contaminated topsoil and clean exteriors of buildings in non-exclusion areas .\nMany were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experience were needed .\nAbout 450 residents , average age about 60 , formed a special project team , supervised by local construction companies , that started doing cleanup work in November 2012 .\nEach worker received a daily wage of \u00a59,500 , which the residents considered good pay .\nOne woman in her 40s who described herself as a homemaker said there were few part-time jobs for women like herself in the area , so she hired on and worked between 2 and 5 days a week , 7-and-a-half hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere was no work quota and , she reports , everyone enjoyed the neighborly camaraderie of toiling together .\nThe job officially ended in September 2014 .\nThe woman said she had made \u00a53 million altogether , but there was more .\nThe cleanup funds for her area that had come from the central government amounted to about \u00a52.65 billion , of which \u00a51.3 billion was left unspent , so all the workers received a kind of bonus .\nIn the end , each made on average about \u00a535,000 a day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ended up getting an extra \u00a57 million , which allowed her to send her son to a private university and buy a new car .\nSome workers received more than \u00a510 million in additional pay .\nAs the deputy team leader put it , \u201c It was like money falling from the sky.\n\u201d According to a documentary special that aired on public broadcaster NHK in February , \u00a55.6 trillion has so far been spent on decontaminating the areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant , but not all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , the goal of which was to bring the affected area back to \u201c normal \u201d as soon as possible so that evacuees could return to their homes .\nBut ten years later that hasn \u2019 t happened , or , at least , not to the degree originally envisioned .\nAfter 90 % of the work was finished , an estimated 60 % of the radiation had been reduced , and the cleanup had become a self-generating public works project with its own profit motives for contractors and sub-contractors .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allocated .\nIdeally , the trade or education ministry should have been in charge , since both have experience in the nuclear energy field ; or the construction ministry , which has extensive experience in large public works projects .\nHowever , the government chose the environment ministry , which has never carried out any large-scale public works .\nThe other ministries , apparently , were loath to take on a job involving \u201c waste.\n\u201d Usually , when a government entity orders work to be done , they set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were multiple distinct areas targeted for cleanup , as well as various stages in the cleanup process .\nUnder such circumstances , general contractors try to get all the work in a given area in order to maximize profits , and ideally , they will have no competition for bids , which means they can essentially charge whatever they want .\nWhen NHK examined the bid documents for the areas targeted for cleanup and related work , they found that 68 percent of the work orders only had one bidder .\nThese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit margin of 5 % , but in this case , it was about 10 % .\nAs one environment ministry official admitted to NHK , they had no real idea about the competitive situation and didn \u2019 t know how to oversee the work .\nAs a result , there was a lot of misuse of funds .\nNHK looked at one subcontractor headquartered in the city of Iwaki , Fukushima Prefecture , that was investigated by the tax authorities .\nThe company \u2019 s president was described by others as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nuclear power station himself and wanted to help his neighbors move back into the area .\nThat \u2019 s why he started the company , with the intention of reconstructing the area .\nThe company grew quickly .\nAfter only two years , its profits exceeded \u00a510 billion , at which point , according to one employee , \u201c the original motivation \u201d for starting the company \u201c disappeared.\n\u201d The company was freely padding receipts and spending money to entertain contractors who controlled work orders so that they could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started giving away new cars to valued employees .\nAfter six years , one of the contractors discovered that the Iwaki subcontractor had bribed several of its employees and dropped the subcontractor .\nSubsequently , the subcontractor started laying off people as profits decreased sharply , and they weren \u2019 t the only ones .\nTwo employees of another large general contractor were arrested for fraud for having reported fake costs and pocketing the difference .\nAs one subcontractor explained , it was easy to do .\nThe manager of a particular job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that twice as many people worked on the job or asks a company that supplies lodging for workers to inflate the room charge on the receipts .\nAt least 15 employees of one general contractor were accused of fraud or failure to report income .\nThe total amount of money swindled in these cases was about \u00a54 billion .\nOne contractor told NHK that he knew the environment ministry was understaffed so he didn \u2019 t worry about getting audited .\nThe ministry asked for more personnel and the government always refused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project .\nAs initially planned , it would be finished in three years and cost a little over \u00a51 trillion , but after 10 years it \u2019 s still not finished and actual costs have soared past \u00a53 trillion , not counting the money spent for processing waste and constructing storage facilities .\nThe ministry planned to build only two incinerators for waste disposal , but the local governments said they would only allow waste collected within their borders to be burned , so the ministry ended up building 16 incinerators in Fukushima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built to last 20 years , half of them have since been demolished in order to alleviate local anxieties , so in many areas the work was not completed , though the cost of waste incineration ended up being more 5 times the original estimate .\nPublic funds paid for all of this , but direct tax money was used mainly for mid-term storage of irradiated materials .\nEverything else related to the cleanup is supposed to be paid for by capital gains made from the government selling Tokyo Electric Power Co. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government bought \u00a51 trillion worth of Tepco stock at \u00a5300 per share and estimates that in order to pay off the cleanup costs they would need to sell that stock at \u00a51,500 per share .\nUnfortunately , the stock hasn \u2019 t gone up in price since the government bought it .\nAs of February 20 , it was about one-fourth what it needed to be , so they have simply put off sale of the shares .\nOne expert NHK talked to , a scholar who has done extensive research into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock doesn \u2019 t go up in price , then the government will end up using tax money anyway to pay for the cleanup ; either that , or Tepco is going to have to cover more of the cost , which means utility bills will go up again .\nSo , the public\u2014more specifically , future generations\u2014pays for it either way .\nThis pay structure was built into the law quite recently .\nOriginally , Tepco was legally responsible for cleaning up any situations caused by an accident at their facilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fukushima disaster , but since the job was so huge the government borrowed money and paid for the operations on behalf of Tepco .\nIn turn , all of Japan \u2019 s electric power companies were supposed to reimburse the government .\nBut in March 2013 , Tepco talked the government into changing the pay structure , convincing it to shoulder more of the burden by saying that making utilities pay for everything is unfair to their shareholders , since nuclear power is a \u201c national policy.\n\u201d A letter that NHK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Tepco would not be able to \u201c revive \u201d itself if the government didn \u2019 t take more responsibility for the cleanup .\nNine months later , the Cabinet decided on the capital gains strategy .\nAccording to various officials interviewed by NHK , the government knew that the capital gains plan wouldn \u2019 t be able to cover the costs of the cleanup , even before it ballooned out of proportion , but that they had to come up with something quickly \u201c on paper.\n\u201d As one trade ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in a double bind , since in order for the stock to go up appreciably , it has to guarantee not only Tepco \u2019 s survival , but its success as a private corporation in the short run .\nAnd that , presumably , means getting nuclear power plants back online as soon as possible , a task that has run up against a wall of public opposition in the wake of the Fukushima disaster .\nIn the summer of 2019 , at a meeting to dissolve the Utsushi-chiku-based project team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had received millions in yen in extra payments .\nAs it turned out , a total of \u00a526 million had been paid to three officials of the team unbeknownst to the team members , and when they found out they were angry .\nThe officials defended the payments , saying that it was \u201c compensation for calculating accounts and working on tax documents , \u201d and that it was perfectly legal .\nOne returned a substantial portion of the money he had received , but the residents were unmoved .\nThe three officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and are now pariahs in the town .\nSince all the money for the cleanup had to come through the city , the Asahi Shimbun reporter asked a city official about the matter .\nHe said it was an \u201c internal problem \u201d for the team .\nThe city had nothing to do with it .\nHowever , when Asahi talked to rank-and-file members of the team , they discovered that many already knew , or at least suspected , that it was easy to make a lot of money .\nSince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 a certain amount per cubic meter of soil collected or per structure cleaned \u2014 and no one was checking , it was easy to inflate unit costs .\nOne worker explained how expensive the black bags were for storing contaminated soil and vegetation .\nThe retail price was \u00a510,600 per bag , so they bought the bags wholesale for \u00a54,200 each and kept the difference .\nUsing such a system , they could make hundreds of thousands of yen extra just on bags for one cleanup job .\nAn elderly farmer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanup , some residents received large compensation payouts from the government because of their relative proximity to the accident while others received much less , even if they were neighbors , thus giving rise to resentments .\nOnce the cleanup started , however , everybody had the same chance to make money and nobody complained .\nThe work , in fact , made it possible for them to endure and eventually return to farming .\nBut what does that mean when , as a result , their sense of community had been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists

destructiveness of war in sensitive ways and hence , whatever their story content , also convey a message of peace .\nIt is true that war films made in any country are often aimed at bringing out mainly the courage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such themes handled with sensitivity can convey a message of peace .\nHaqeekat , a war film made with a lot of sensitivity and commitment by Chetan Anand , is perhaps the most durable war film made in Hindi cinema .\nWhen we see this film , the great sense of dedication with which this film has been made by various members of the film unit comes across very clearly , whether in acting or in the great songs which are still widely used for their inspirational as well as sad content\u2014songs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majboor mujhe .\nLet us recall the background to this film .\nThe defeat in China War of 1962 was seen as a great debacle in India .\nThere was a lot of criticism , and an overwhelming sadness .\nThe country had to come out of this .\nChetan Anand starts with this aim .\nThis is a war film which sets out not to glorify any victory but to make defeat acceptable without losing honor .\nThe way forward Anand finds is to focus on just one point of very courageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the defeat and the debacle there were some cases of Indian soldiers fighting very bravely in very difficult conditions .\nInstead of going into the wider debacle or its causes Chetan Anand just focuses on one case of very courageous resistance .\nSo he can still remain close to truth in the part selected by him , without going into the wider controversial details .\nHis point of courageous resistance is then inter-woven with love-stories and close human ties being threatened to make a poignant and sensitive story which brings out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports myths at some levels but in ways which are not harmful and provide solace to people .\nOn the other hand the sensitive handling of the various situations , the relationships , the songs also leave a lasting anti-war message , a message of the futility of war , in ways where this does not appear to be an imposed message at all .\nIn another film Hindustan Ki Kasam Chetan Anand takes up the Indo-Pak war of 1965 .\nThis time the context is of Air force rather than of army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skills of Indian fighter pilots , the impact in terms of the devastation caused in a single family of exceptionally courageous and committed members is brought out very vividly .\nHence this film also conveys an overwhelming message of peace , a message of futility of war .\nIn contrast to these predominantly war films , Usne Kaha Tha , a film of Bimal Roy Productions , is not primarily a war film but instead a love story .\nThis is based on the famous short story of the same title written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film the anti-war message is more emphasized than in the story .\nThe song which is filmed against the background of departing soldiers Jaane Wale Sipahi se Poochho Wo Kahaan Jaa Raha Hai ( Ask the departing soldier where he is headed for ) can perhaps be called the most defining anti-war song of Hindi cinema .\nThese are only a few examples which reveal how war themes can also be treated in ways which ultimately leave a message of peace .\nAnother remarkable film made by V.Shantaram titled Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services of a great doctor from India ( a real-life story ) to Chinese soldiers and people during the Second World War .\nThis film still reminds people of the need and importance of friendship between India and China even though

@ @ @ @ @ in the Indian Ocean Region ( IOR ) , India should not punch above its weight .\nIt may not be a coincidence that Washington administered this firm stricture within earshot of Prime Minister

assistance projects funded by India in Seychelles and the handing over of a Fast Patrol Vessel supplied by India for the use of the Seychelles Coast Guard.\n\u201d Modi dramatically called @ @ @ @ @ @

for International Development of Thailand \u2019 s Mae Fah Luang University and The Asia Foundation , on March 18 , 2021 .\nThe day before John F Kennedy \u2019 s inauguration in 1961 , he met with an outgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papers , \u201c Eisenhower said with considerable emotion that Laos was the key to the entire area of Southeast Asia \u2026 that we should make every effort to persuade member nations of SEATO \u2026 to defend the freedom of Laos \u2026 President-elect Kennedy \u2026 asked if the situation seemed to be approaching a climax \u2026 Eisenhower stated that the entire proceeding was extremely confused.\n\u201d If , two months ago , a similar briefing had been given to a president-elect Biden by an outgoing President Trump , the details 60 years on would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tenor and message strikingly similar .\nThe main difference would have been a shift in focus from Laos \u2013 and by extension , Indochina \u2013 in 1961 , to Thailand on the mainland and to the Philippines in maritime Southeast Asia .\nThat is , a shift from countries six decades ago whose governments the US was propping up , to those today with which it has increasingly uncertain relations .\nAnd , of course , two weeks after that recent imaginary briefing , Myanmar would have been added to the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however \u2013and for the policy it was intended to inform \u2013 would have been nearly identical : an assertive People \u2019 s Republic of China with growing influence in Southeast Asia .\nThe Indo-Pacific Directorate , the largest within the new National Security Council , reflects the importance the Biden administration is placing on the region .\nIt is led by former assistant secretary Kurt Campbell , well known to Southeast Asia , three China directors and up to 17 other officials .\nIn his first major speech , Blinken himself characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of the 21st century.\n\u201d China was the only country-specific foreign policy issue among the eight he explicitly addressed , and perhaps not since the start of the War on Terror 20 years ago has there been an issue with such broad bipartisan support .\nWith the exceptions of climate change and nuclear proliferation , for which Biden has revisited his vice-presidential view of China as a \u201c cooperative partner , \u201d President Biden is set to continue his predecessor \u2019 s characterization of Beijing as a \u201c peer competitor.\n\u201d Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who inherited a global Cold War , Southeast Asia will be for President Biden one of the most pivotal regions of his foreign policy .\nDiplomatically , he will seek to make up for influence lost to China .\nMilitarily , he will prepare for \u2013 although not precipitate \u2013 a regional security crisis involving China on some level .\nThis is not to predict that such a crisis will in fact occur , but rather that Biden will take into account the 2018 assessment of the US Indo-Pacific Commander that \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.\n\u201d Concerning diplomacy \u2013 which he has pledged to privilege in his foreign policy \u2013 President Biden will continue rebuilding the State Department .\nThailand experienced a 17-month period without a US ambassador until March last year , while vacancies in the Philippines , Singapore , current ASEAN chair Brunei and at ASEAN itself all precede his inauguration .\nSingapore \u2019 s vacancy dates back to Trump \u2019 s inauguration .\nSecretary Blinken \u2019 s calls to the foreign ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his confirmation demonstrate that bilateral relations will retain their place in Biden \u2019 s diplomacy toolbox , and that bilateral alliances will be given broader meaning .\nAt the same time , multilateralism will likely prove the more widely and publicly used tactic .\nAfter not one but two years of superficial US representation at ASEAN summits hosted by Thailand and Vietnam , expect four years of perfect attendance in Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia and Laos PDR by either the president , the vice-president or the secretary of state .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile of the Mekong River and its economic subregion , which many see as mainland Southeast Asia \u2019 s equivalent of the South China Sea .\nWhile it is too early to assess the effectiveness of Trump \u2019 s Mekong-US Partnership , which replaced the Obama administration \u2019 s Lower Mekong Initiative , engagement under Biden is set to rise in response to China \u2019 s own Lancang-Mekong Cooperation forum .\nAnd finally , as made plain by Interim National Security Strategic Guidance released by the White House earlier this month and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a newly elevated USAID , Biden will clearly if carefully reinject the promotion of democracy , human rights and the rule of law into Southeast Asian diplomacy .\nThis \u201c values-based \u201d approach may well be advanced in response to Myanmar \u2019 s recent coup , though tempered by the strain in bilateral relations caused by lump criticism of Thailand \u2019 s 2014 coup , and by America \u2019 s own domestic democratic recession .\nSoutheast Asia is also the front line militarily in America \u2019 s new peer competition with China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where China is located .\nBilateral defense treaties with Japan and South Korea are on solid ground \u2013 as are over 65,000 US troops between them .\nNorth Korea admittedly remains unpredictable , but it falls within an area more of common interest between the US and China than of potential conflict .\nAnd where conflict is potential \u2013 namely over Taiwan \u2013 how it starts and ends will turn as much on contested and newly militarized islands , reefs and shoals in the South China Sea as it will on points further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inaugural US-ASEAN naval exercises of 2019 , engage the US-ASEAN Defense Forum and continue the inclusive flagship Cobra Gold exercises .\nBut in the reverse of his diplomatic tactics , he will otherwise focus far more on bilateral than multilateral defense relations .\nAfter all , Thailand \u2013 also a major non-NATO ally \u2013 and the Philippines are the only two Southeast Asian nations party to the 1954 Manila Pact .\nAt the same time , Biden \u2019 s Southeast Asia policy will also face headwinds largely beyond his control .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles in its dealings with external powers : neutrality \u2013 \u201c Don \u2019 t make us choose a side \u201d \u2013 and \u201c ASEAN centrality.\n\u201d These principles are mutually exclusive .\nWhile ASEAN is the oldest piece of abundant regional architecture and sits squarely at the center of the Indo-Pacific , centrality means more than pedigree and more than geography .\nIt means leveraging those positions to the point of becoming essential , to becoming the institution whose views and voice on any major issue implicating the Indo-Pacific must be accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , concerning the paramount geopolitical issue of our time , the meeting of the global powers on ASEAN \u2019 s very doorstep , the institution rushes to the periphery .\nAnd there it remains , well , peripheral , sacrificing its potential centrality for a neutrality that places it at the mercy of the great powers .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t force us to choose \u201d is thus merely a reactive request , rather than the basis of a proactive and agency-driven policy .\nThis poses a challenge to Biden since China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to deal with its member states on a strictly bilateral basis , rather than face a unified \u2013 and potentially opposing \u2013 voice on issues of contention between Washington and Beijing .\nOn the other hand , Southeast Asia , by almost any measure , may be the most diverse region in the world , as reflected in an ASEAN whose construction , although indigenous , recalls the colonial era divisions and definitions it had to contend with .\nIt is fair to ask what the average policymaker in , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several seas away \u2013 has in common with a counterpart in , say , Myanmar , host to an official 135 ethnic minorities and bordering both China and India .\nWhat do policymakers in a land-locked Laos of just seven million mostly Buddhist citizens have in common with their counterparts in a Muslim-majority Indonesian archipelago with a population 39 times as large ?\nUnwittingly or otherwise , the Trump administration \u2019 s emphasis on bilateralism was thus a recognition of certain realities that are not going way , and that Biden will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one , but 11 , Southeast Asia policies : ASEAN and each of its 10 member states .\nMore to the point , and in sharp contrast to Kennedy \u2019 s time , Southeast Asian countries do not see China nearly so predictably , or as congruently with the American point of view , as they did 60 years ago .\nTalk of a new Cold War may have equal traction in Washington and in regional capitals , but participation at all in such a standoff \u2013 much less in ways Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story .\nAgain , one need look no further than treaty allies Thailand and the Philippines for the most dramatic expression of this changed and changing landscape .\nIn the end and in conclusion , whether President Biden \u2019 s policy on Southeast Asia is successful will depend not only on America \u2019 s ability to compete with Beijing , but also on Southeast Asia \u2019 s calculation of its own interests .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or

.\nThe Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is due to visit Tehran on April 14 .\nOverall , these geopolitical realignments are taking place as the US intensifies its suppression of China and Russia .\nBut , for Turkey , the intervention in Syria has proved profitable .\nThe Turkish-controlled territories of northern Syria consists of a 8,835-square-kilometre area already and Ankara has no intentions to vacate its occupation .\nTurkey will no doubt look for similar gains .\nFor a start , regaining primacy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 irreplaceable partner and as Europe \u2019 s interlocutor with Muslim Middle East has always been a Turkish dream .\nA clincher will be whether Washington can prevail upon the EU to grant some special dispensation for Turkey \u2014 \u201c associate membership \u201d is one possibility .\nFor EU , too , Turkey becomes a key partner if NATO is to consolidate in the Black Sea and encircle Russia in its backyard .\nTurkey has already positioned

, the \u201c olive branch \u201d given by the EU leaders to Erdogan has \u201c five main leaves \u201d : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Customs Union ; \u2022 Commitment to continue the flow of funds for refugees in Turkey ; \u2022 Adding momentum to the relations with Turkey on key cooperation areas ; and , All in all , Turkey is being \u201c incentivised \u201d to get back into the western fold and play its due role as NATO power .\nToday , Turkey is probably the only ally regionally and internationally that Washington can lean on to wean Pakistan away from the orbit of influence of China and Russia , which truly makes Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan .\nIndeed , Russia and Turkey have been historically rivals in Afghanistan .\nTurkey has deep-rooted centuries-old

developments in the Indo-Pacific region .\nThis fact is of particular importance against the backdrop of the continuing decline of the US role in the world in general and in the region in particular .\nWhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the country .\nThat is , the process is quite objective in nature and does not depend on political rhetoric about the \u201c return \u201d ( to somewhere and for some reason ) of the next American administration .\nThis is evidenced by its own statements about the rejection of scenarios of forceful intervention in internal political perturbations of other countries , about the continuation of the policy of the previous administration on the military withdrawal from Afghanistan and in general the reduction of the American military presence in the Greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of America \u201d to Europe , the problems arising from it can already be seen with the naked eye .\nFor example , in connection with contradictory signals from Washington about the Nord Stream 2 project .\nFor the price of the issue is not so much this project and the ( pseudo ) problem of the \u201c Russian challenge \u201d in general , but rather the relations with Germany , the leading European country .\nAnd , consequently , this \u201c price \u201d includes a very likely problematization of NATO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military and political presence of the United States in Europe .\nIt is unlikely that the trade and economic ( quite extensive ) sphere of Euro-Atlantic relations will undergo significant changes .\nBut this is a completely different format from what they had during the entire Cold War period .\nSo far , no such progress has been seen in US relations with its key Asian allies .\nMainly because Asia is now the place where the principal geopolitical opponent of the United States is located , in the form of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , first , strengthen the long-standing bilateral alliances here , and , second , to create something akin to a multilateral ( Asian ) counterpart of NATO in the IPR .\nJapan remains a key US ally in the region , and Washington has given it an equally important role in a ( hypothetical ) \u201c Asian NATO \u201d .\nThe current forum-based QUAD of the United States , Japan , India , and Australia , whose first ( video ) summit was held on March 12 this year , is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politico-military alliance .\nOnce again , we note that this event , too , did not dispel the dense fog that originally surrounded the prospect of a full-fledged multilateral military-political alliance with an anti-Chinese orientation in the region .\nMainly because there is no more or less common perception of the PRC as a source of threat to national interests in Asian countries today .\nThis is fundamentally different from the situation in Cold War Europe .\nBeijing still has problems of varying degrees of importance in its relations with almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to territorial disputes that have their origins in both relatively recent and rather distant history .\nThis kind of problem can only be solved on the basis of the goodwill of the parties directly involved and is unlikely to be resolved within the framework of current international law .\nThis is illustrated by the zero significance of the decision of the Arbitration Court in The Hague in the summer of 2016 regarding China \u2019 s claims to ownership of 80-90 % of the South China Sea .\nIt has had no effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian subregion , but can be taken advantage of by some \u201c problem solver \u201d as a legal justification for the use of force here .\nSo far , the main ( external , it is important to emphasize ) \u201c solver \u201d in this regard is Washington .\nBut lately some of the Europeans have decided to join the US for some reason .\nWhich continues to amaze , for it is completely incomprehensible why Europeans are multiplying the number of their own problems by getting into the anthill ( already going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the globe .\nAnd there are no threats to their trade and economic ties with Southeast Asia , China , Japan , South Korea\u2026 That is , in the area in which postwar Europe so excelled and what accounts for its current standing in the international arena .\nAnd in which postwar Japan was no less successful .\nHowever , its increasing presence in the IPR is not at all surprising .\nFor Japan is an inseparable and one of the most important elements of the region .\nEurope and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , too .\nBut rather in the role of guests ( invited , which is important to emphasize ) , not as the hosts .\nWho are suffering from obviously inflated self-esteem , the consequence of which is their current ridiculous position as teachers in the field of \u201c human rights \u201d .\nHowever , they have been taking that stance for completely understandable political and practical purposes .\nAs for Japan , it could not be excluded from the IPR ( and SEA ) even if it wanted to .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 ) Japan-Indonesia meeting in Tokyo on March 30 in the \u201c 2+2\u2033 format , that is , with the participation of foreign and defense ministers , was rather notable .\nJudging by the comments of its results , the parties have found common ground on a wide range of issues .\nIndonesia is one of the main countries of Southeast Asia and the ASEAN regional grouping , with the world \u2019 s leading players vying for influence .\nWithout exception , all ASEAN members seek to move beyond the format of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players \u201d and to position themselves in one way or another in relation to each of them without really \u201c offending \u201d any of them .\nSince it \u2019 s really more trouble than it \u2019 s worth .\nIn this regard , the trip of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi along the Tokyo-Beijing route looked quite natural .\nDuring her talks with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi , the ( no less broad ) range of topics was discussed : from cooperation in combating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to security issues in Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend in Chinese foreign policy aimed at reducing its notorious \u201c assertiveness \u201d while increasingly striving to develop mutually beneficial relations with its neighbors .\nWithout this , both the success of China \u2019 s key Belt and Road Initiative project and the extremely difficult role of the global power , whose interests go far beyond some local turmoil and conflicts , will be impossible .\nIn this context , it is difficult to overestimate the positive significance of stopping and possibly reversing one of the most serious conflicts in recent decades between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the members of the regional strategic triangle identified above .\nWith Japan , the matters are much more complicated .\nEspecially after the US-Japan \u201c 2+2\u2033 talks in mid-March , which will be followed up by a visit to the United States by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga .\nWashington \u2019 s commitments to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands , recorded after the first event , were granted to Tokyo , of course , \u201c for a reason \u201d .\nThey could turn out to be chains , constraining Japan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional politics .\nAs happened a few years ago , when the instrument of issuing such commitments was used by Washington in order to disrupt the process of building relations between Tokyo and Moscow .\nHowever , a positive factor for Sino-Japanese relations remains the signing late last year ( after years of negotiations ) of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership with the participation of 15 IPR countries , chief among them China and Japan .\nLet us note , though , a negative aspect of the negotiation process on this topic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at the last moment .\nNo less important for Sino-Japanese relations may be the realization of Beijing \u2019 s recently announced intention to join another Japanese-led regional association , the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ) , which includes 11 countries of the same IPR .\nOnce again , if the many regional problems are to be solved at all , it will only be with the growing participation of the three leading regional powers that make up the China-Japan-India regional strategic configuration .\nHelping its participants with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their own ( joint ) request .\nThere are nuances in the positions of each of them on the increasingly important situation in Myanmar , a Southeast Asian country and member of ASEAN .\nBut none of the three mentioned are hysterical about the \u201c crimes of the military junta , \u201d in contrast to the hysteria in which almost immediately and unanimously ( after the famous events in this country ) all the major Western capitals found themselves .\nInstead , the press of leading Asian countries is turning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar in order to get to the bottom of what happened in that country on February 1 this year .\nIt would be very appropriate and timely for Asia to collectively address these capitals : \u201c Guys ( and gals as well ) !\nForget the old colonial times and deal with your own current problems .\nYou have just as many , and they are just as serious .\nAnd we \u2019 ll deal with our own , this time without you.\n\u201d Let us add to this ( hypothetical ) address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own \u201c solvers \u201d of regional problems .\nNote to readers :

Moscow daily Kommersant commented that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \u2019 s visit to New Delhi on April 5-6 \u201c is not going to be easy because relations between the two countries are facing an increasing number of risks , which particularly include the Chinese factor test.\n\u201d Indeed , the daily politely printed a laboured Indian explanation that the crucial difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer ties between Moscow and Beijing \u201c mostly stem from the two countries \u2019 common negative agenda \u201d with the United States , but \u201c there is neither a negative agenda nor related damage in terms of Moscow \u2019 s relations with New Delhi.\n\u201d Again , on Monday , another Moscow paper Nezavisimaya Gazeta quoted a Russian pundit , Professor Sergei Lunev at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations , as saying , \u201c Relations have been stalled for the past ten years .\nEconomic ties are suffering in particular .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India \u2019 s top three economic partners , but Russia barely makes it into the top twenty.\n\u201d But , again , the professor pointed out , \u201c There also are some positive aspects .\nFor instance , cooperation is underway on the Sputnik V vaccine .\nIndia will produce it in larger amounts than Russia itself .\nDefence cooperation remains a cornerstone of relations and progress continues here on all tracks , from the S-400 systems to small arms .\nRussia accounts for half of India \u2019 s weapons exports.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iceberg , as a certain distancing has appeared between Moscow and Delhi lately .\nThis must be the first time that a Russian Foreign Minister undertook a whirlwind regional tour of India and Pakistan .\nMore importantly , this must be a rarest of rare occasions when a visiting Russian foreign minister was not received by India \u2019 s prime minister .\nThe latter part is particularly glaring as PM Modi enjoys diplomatic interactions and would doubtless allot quality time for Mike Pompeo or Antony Blinken .\n( Modi found time even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently . )\nAlas , the signalling is that Russia is no longer a priority .\nYet , this isn \u2019 t about diplomatic signalling alone .\nIn the feudal darbar culture in Delhi , this also signified a signpost for the entire governmental machinery \u2014 bureaucrats and politicians , civilian and military alike .\nWhereas , the perception through Modi \u2019 s first term had been that he was a stakeholder in India-Russia friendship , investing in it personally his time and energy .\nEven the political establishment in Washington watched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece in the Washington-based online journal Nikkei Asian Review last August by Marco Rubio \u2014 high-flying Republican senator from Florida and acting chairman of the US Senate Intelligence Committee , co-chair of Congressional executive commission on China and a ranking member of Senate committee on foreign relations \u2014 carried barbs personally aimed at Modi as if PM was acting under some magical spell that Russian President Putin cast on him .\nNow , Rubio himself may have some difficulty to locate India on a world map .\nClearly , this favourite sidekick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , secretary of state Pompeo \u2014 was standing in to transmit a sinister , ominous , barely-veiled warning to Delhi that it was about time Modi disengaged from the India-Russia relationship .\nThat is why today , any signalling that Modi has lost interest looks a cowardly behaviour and can be lethal to the India-Russia relationship .\nIt may pacify the US foreign policy establishment and President Joe Biden himself , who are paranoid about \u201c killer \u201d Putin and frantic that so long as Russia ties continue to provide an anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agenda to lock in India in the American stable as a military ally will remain elusive .\nTo be sure , the US remains vigilant about every breath Modi takes , every move he makes , every bond he forges with Putin to energise India \u2019 s relations with Russia .\nThe US geo-strategy is heavily loaded , too , as it is proving to be immensely rewarding \u2014 India has already given up its fascination for Russian energy and has settled for US shale oil ; Russia \u2019 s status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier is being steadily replaced with American weaponry .\nLate on Monday , in fact , even as Lavrov \u2019 s plane was landing in Delhi , Secretary of State Blinken announced in Washington the names of Turkish officials and entities who will be sanctioned w.e.f Wednesday for Ankara \u2019 s acquisition of the advanced S-400 Russian air defence system .\nA timely reminder for External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar !\nSurely , Lavrov was asked about the US pressure regarding India \u2019 s S-400 deal .\nHe replied , \u201c This has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United States .\nEveryone knows this well .\nWe are also well aware of the response from India.\n\u201d Lavrov added , \u201c American \u2018 calls \u2019 were not discussed today ( with Jaishankar . )\n\u2026 I did not feel any hesitation here on the part of our Indian friends and partners.\n\u201d Jaishankar of course kept mum .\nInterestingly , Lavrov in his characteristic way also chose to unilaterally comment on the \u201c Asian NATO \u201d ( read Quad ) .\nHe said , \u201c Today we exchanged opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian friends have a common position that this would be counterproductive ( as a military alliance . )\nWe are interested in making our cooperation inclusive and keen for it to work towards something and not against anyone.\n\u201d But Jaishankar wouldn \u2019 t respond .\nHe instead titled his head sideways and with an enigmatic look curled his lips .\nIndia has a rare international environment today to strengthen its strategic autonomy and take advantage of it .\nBut it needs political courage to explore the new opportunities .\nOn the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to hitch wagons to Biden \u2019 s \u201c America is back \u201d platform .\nGood luck to Modi Govt !\nChina realises that India is best left alone to explore the pathway it has chosen , and to self-assess later with hindsight the efficacy of such a trek .\nThus , things have ground to a halt in the disengagement process in Ladakh .\nEqually , Lavrov \u2019 s visit shows that Moscow too is giving a wide berth to Modi Govt .\nIn his opening statement at the joint press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By tradition , our relations stand out for mutual respect .\nThey are intrinsically valuable and not subject to opportunistic fluctuations.\n\u201d When a veteran diplomat brings himself to reminisce , the striking thing is that he thought it important and necessary to speak in plain words .\nLavrov has a well-earned reputation for being frank .\nComparisons have been drawn frequently in the West between Lavrov and the iconic figure of the Soviet era Andrey Gromyko .\nOn the occasion of Gromyko \u2019 s 110th anniversary , in a poignant speech in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Note to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site , internet forums .\netc .", "author": "M.

fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encircling and containing China , including the blunting of its economic rise as a whole , and the sabotage of individual Chinese companies poised to overtake their Western rivals .\nMore recently , Australia followed suit in a US-led propaganda campaign to shift the blame for the global COVID-19 crisis on China .\nA Reuters article titled , \u201c Africa \u2019 s miners

also attempted to explain how this trade row recently escalated when Canberra , \u201c led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.\n\u201d Of course , this was a politically-motivated inquiry meant to insinuate China was responsible for the spread of COVID-19 , and by implication , also responsible for the resulting global crisis .\nLogically , even if China had been responsible for COVID-19 \u2019 s spread throughout its own territory , failing to detect , isolate , and contain its spread , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for it spreading in Australia or the US .\nWhat prevented the Australian or US governments from detecting , isolating , and containing the spread of the virus within their own borders , and how exactly would China be to blame for the fact that they didn \u2019 t ?\nHere reveals the propaganda value of this inquiry and precisely why China responded through additional tariffs against Australian imports .\nThe trade war is hurting Australia in ways it will not be able to overcome without quickly reconciling with Beijing .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Australia can not simply be diverted elsewhere .\nWhich nation possesses the same sized industrial base and demand for such ore ?\nThe answer is ; no one .\nWorse still are \u201c economic solutions \u201d Australia is exploring to make up for its declining economic health .\nAustralian state media , ABC , in an article titled , \u201c Australia to produce its own guided missiles as part of billion-dollar defence manufacturing plan , \u201d would claim : Thus , there really is no \u201c sovereign capability \u201d being developed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian subsidiaries of US and Western European-based arms manufacturers , using Australian tax dollars , and creating a minimum number of jobs in the process all while using technology with little to no practical application outside the realm of arms manufacturing .\nThe missiles , once completed , will most likely be pointed at China by Australia , or sold to nations in the region who will likewise point them at China .\nThe propaganda campaign fueling Australia \u2019 s growing antagonism toward China and creating the climate of fear among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stems from policy think tanks like the Australian Strategic Policy Institute ( ASPI ) .\nThat ASPI is funded by the very same arms manufactures mentioned above , Raytheon and Lockheed , directly profiting from the growing crisis , should be no surprise .\nIf the trade row wasn \u2019 t bad enough , special interests driving Australian foreign policy doubling down on \u201c solutions \u201d that will only expand the row ( and also a wider conflict ) signals to Beijing that Australia wasn \u2019 t , isn \u2019 t and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t be a reliable partner .\nConversely , China has plenty of alternatives to choose from and has been cultivating them for years out of a desire to hedge against economic uncertainties .\nBut it was a strategy that has clearly served Beijing well in the face of the sort of political uncertainties Australia \u2019 s antagonism now represents .\nThe same Reuters article discussing Australia \u2019 s China-COVID-19 inquiry would also note : The article covers a wide range of ores , minerals and other goods China is seeking to diversify away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward partners in Africa .\nThe article describes how in just a few years , momentum is already starting to swing in favour of African exporters at Australia \u2019 s expense .\nOnce the process is complete , it will be very difficult for Australia \u2019 s government to repair both the political damage it has created and convince Beijing to forego its new partners in favour of a return to Australian trade , now proven to be politically unreliable .\nLike the US itself whom Australia follows the lead of , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fundamental inability to accept an emerging global balance of power , correcting the unwarranted concentration of power and wealth in the hands of Western nations at the expense of the rest of the world .\nAustralia \u2019 s inability to find a constructive role to play among the

region , is not \u201c going to be \u201d Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia \u2019 s downfall .\nHow far Australia falls , and if it arrives at depths it can never fully return from , is up to

Palestine as a State on March 30 is a welcomed position , though it comes with many caveats .\nPro-Palestinian activists are justified to question the sincerity of the ALP \u2019 s stance and whether Australia \u2019 s Labor is genuinely prepared to fully adopt this position should they form a government following the 2022 elections .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Palestine is quite indecisive .\nWhile it commits the ALP to recognize Palestine as a State , it \u201c expects that this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor government \u201d .\n\u2018 Expecting \u2019 that the issue would be made an \u2018 important priority \u2019 is not the same as confirming that the recognition of Palestine is resolved , should Labor take office .\nMoreover , the matter has been an \u2018 important priority \u2019 for the ALP for years .\nIn fact , similar language was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference in December 2018 , which supported \u201c the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognized borders , \u201d while adding this important clause : The ALP \u201c calls on the next Labor government to recognize Palestine as a State \u201d .\nUnfortunately for Labor , they lost the May 2019 elections , where the Liberal Party maintained the majority , again forming a government under the leadership of Scott Morrison .\nMorrison was the Prime Minister of Australia when , in 2018 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy shift on Palestine .\nIn fact , it was Morrison \u2019 s regressive position on Israel that supposedly compelled Labor to develop a seemingly progressive position on Palestine .\nNine days after former US President , Donald Trump , defied international law by officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2013 and subsequently relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem \u2013 Morrison flirted with the idea as well , hoping to enlist the support of the pro-Israel lobbies in Australia prior to the elections .\nHowever , Morrison did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by refraining from moving his country \u2019 s embassy to the occupied city .\nInstead , he developed a precarious \u2013 albeit still illegal \u2013 position where he recognized West Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital , promising to move his country \u2019 s \u201c embassy to West Jerusalem when practical , in support of , and after , final-status determination.\n\u201d Canberra , however , did take \u2018 practical \u2019 steps , including a decision to establish a defense and trade office in Jerusalem and proceeded to look for a site for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-serving strategy remains a political embarrassment for Australia , as it drew the country closer to Trump \u2019 s illegal , anti-Palestinian stance .\nWhile the vast majority of United Nations member states maintained a unified position regarding the illegality of the Israeli occupation of Palestine , asserting that the status of Jerusalem can only be determined based on a negotiated agreement , the Australian government thought otherwise .\nAs Palestinians , Arabs and other nations mobilized against Australia \u2019 s new position , the ALP came under pressure to balance out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as blindly supportive of military occupation and apartheid .\nSince the ALP lost the elections , their new policy on Palestine could not be evaluated .\nNow , according to their latest policy conference conclusion , this same position has been reiterated , although with some leeway , that could potentially allow Labor to reverse or delay that position , once they are in power .\nNonetheless , the Labor position is an important step for Palestinians in their \u2018 legitimacy war \u2019 against the Israeli occupation .\nIn a recent interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories , the international law expert explained the need to \u201c distinguish symbolic politics from substantive politics \u201d .\nPractically , this means that , often , the militarily weaker side which may lose numerous military battles could ultimately win the war .\nThis was as true in the case of Vietnam in 1975 as it was in South Africa in 1994 .\nIt should also be true in the case of Palestine .\nThis is precisely why pro-Israeli politicians , media pundits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ALP \u2019 s recognition of Palestine .\nAmong the numerous angry responses , the most expressive is the position of Michael Danby .\nHe was quoted by Australian Jewish News website as saying that ALP leaders , Anthony Albanese and Richard Marles , have done more than adopting the pro-Palestinian position of former British Labor leader , Jeremy Corbyn , by also adopting \u201c his Stalinist methods by suppressing debate on the foreign policy motions \u201d .\nIsrael and its supporters fully understand the significance of Falk \u2019 s \u2018 legitimacy war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military superiority and complete dominance over occupied Palestinians may allow it to sustain its military occupation on the ground a while longer , but it does very little to advance its moral position , reputation and legitimacy .\nThe fact that ALP \u2019 s position advocates a two-state solution \u2013 which is neither just nor practical \u2013 should not detract from the fact that the recognition of Palestine is still a stance that can be utilized in the Palestinian quest for legitimizing their struggle and delegitimizing Israel \u2019 s apartheid .\nFalk \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and \u2018 symbolic politics \u2019 applies here , too .\nWhile calling for defunct two-states is part of the substantive politics that is necessitated by international consensus , the symbolism of recognizing Palestine is a crucial step in dismantling Israel \u2019 s monopoly over the agenda of the West \u2019 s political elites .\nIt is an outright defeat of the efforts of pro-Israeli lobbies .\nPoliticians , anywhere , can not possibly win the legitimacy war for Palestinians , or any other oppressed nation .\nIt is the responsibility of the Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda on the often self-serving politicians so that the symbolic politics may someday become substantive .\nThe ALP recognition of Palestine is , for now , mere symbolism .\nIf utilized correctly , through pressure , advocacy and mobilization , it could turn into something

continues to be a principal source of carbon emissions , comparable to transport and such industries as steel and cement .\nIntense debate surrounds the issue of the pace at which it is greening .\nIn this paper we offer a precise definition of greening as a rising proportion of electric power sourced from water , wind and sun ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally renewable .\nUsing the latest data from the BP Energy Review as well as national and regional sources , we demonstrate that by 2019 the EU-28 had reached a proportion of electricity generated from WWS of 34 % , followed by China at 27 % , Japan at 19 % and the US at 17 % .\nMoreover , the EU-28 achieved the fastest pace of transition , increasing its WWS-share of electricity generated from 20 % in 2010 to 34 % in 2019 , or a 14 % green shift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China \u2019 s green shift in power generation was 10 % , while that of Japan was 9 % ( all achieved in the decade following the Fukushima disaster ) and the US at an 7 % shift .\nThe IEA has just issued a report revealing that globally renewable sources of energy account for 29 % of electricity generated in 2020 , up 2 % on 2019 levels .\nIn this paper we examine the performance of China in greatest detail , since it is now the world \u2019 s largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s largest electric power system , and is responsible for the highest levels of carbon emissions .\nWe make the case that China has overall goals of decarbonization and dematerialization ( i.e .\nusing less material per unit of GDP ) , where the former goal is met by the shift to renewable sources of energy and the latter by the shift towards urban mining and the circular economy .\nBased on newly published data from the China Energy Council , we update our previous analyses of China \u2019 s energy choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an otherwise black energy system .\nChina \u2019 s electric power system , now the largest in the world , continues to burn a lot of coal \u2013 nearly 4 billion tonnes in 2020 , a 1 % decrease on the 2019 total .\nBut within this black power economy the green shoots are increasingly significant .\nWe show that the proportion of China \u2019 s electric power generation sourced from water , wind and sun ( WWS ) by 2020 reached 27 % , up from 17 % a decade earlier \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade .\nIn terms of generating capacity the figures for China are even more striking .\nIn 2020 China \u2019 s generating capacity sourced from WWS reached 41 % , up from 25 % in 2011 , or a 16 % green shift in capacity in 10 years .\nAt this rate of a 1.6 % green shift in generating capacity per year , China \u2019 s electric power system would be more green than black by 2026 , with widespread repercussions , for China and the world .\nWe put these data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the perspective that China is electrifying its economy faster than any other major region .\nBut the levels of carbon emissions continue to rise ( reaching 13.5 billion tonnes carbon dioxide in 2020 ) , with China \u2019 s leadership not predicting their peaking before 2030 .\nSo there is much to be done in terms of decarbonizing energy and electric power in particular .\nThe wider significance of China \u2019 s green choices , in the context of its increasing assertiveness internationally , is discussed .\nThe greening of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of major concern , with attention focused on the sectors with the highest carbon emissions \u2013 electric power generation , transport ( including shipping ) , and industrial sectors such as steel and cement .\nWhile the consumption of fossil fuels ( coal in electric power generation , oil in transport and natural gas in industry ) the absolute levels usually discussed conceal any underlying greening tendency in terms of an accelerating shift towards renewable sources .\nIn this paper we offer a definition of greening of the electric power sector in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from water , wind and sun ( WWS ) \u2013 both in terms of electric power capacity and in terms of electricity generated .\nWe focus on the level of electric power sourced from WWS , and the pace of the green shift , in terms of the total proportional shift over the past 10 years .\nOur interest is mainly focused on China , because it now has the largest electric power system in the world , and continues to burn the largest quantity of coal and emit the largest quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this context , we wish to know whether the greening of China \u2019 s electric power system outweighs its blackening , and the pace at which this green shift is occurring .\nFirst we examine the share of renewables ( WWS ) in total electric power generation , placing the EU-28 , China , Japan and the US in comparative perspective .\nThe data up to 2019 from the BP Statistical Review are given in Fig .\n1 , which we have prepared based on the data available .\nFigure 1 .\nShare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by region , 2000-2019 The global picture is dominated by the EU-28 , which over the past 10 years has raised the proportion of electricity generated from WWS from 20 % to very nearly 34 % \u2014 or a 14 % green shift in 10 years .\nThe EU is followed by China , which reached 27 % by 2019 ( up from 17 % in 2011 , or a 10 % green shift in the past decade ) .\nThen follows Japan which reached 19 % by 2019 ( a 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 17 % ( up from 10 % a decade ago , a 7 % shift ) .\nAt a global level , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) has now just released its 2020 Global Energy Review , where electric power trends over the past 10 years are examined from the perspective of rising proportions of electric power from renewables and falling proportions from coal \u2013 as shown in our Fig .\n2.1This is ( we believe ) the first time that the IEA has charted electric power trends in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power sourced from renewables .\nTo summarise : In terms of our definition of greening , the world has witnessed an increase in electricity generation sourced from water , wind and sun reaching 29 % by 2020 , up from 20 % a decade earlier ( according to the IEA ) .\nThe EU has reached the highest proportion of power sourced from WWS , and it is greening fastest \u2013 a 14 % green shift in power generated in 10 years .\nChina follows the EU at 27 % of its power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greening proceeding at a rate of 10 % green shift in the last 10 years , then Japan at a green shift of 9 % and the US at 7 % .\nThe IEA source indicates that Chinese carbon emissions in 2020 ( post-pandemic ) exceed levels for 2019 .\nThe EU overtook China to become the world \u2019 s greenest electric power system in 2009 , and accelerated its transition , greening in the past decade from 20 % electricity sourced from WWS to close to 34 % \u2014 a 14 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nAt this rate it will take the EU another 20 years to raise its proportion of green power to 50 % \u2014 a tipping point of enormous significance .\nJapan too has been increasing the proportion of electricity sourced from WWS from 10 % in 2010 to 19 % by 2019 \u2013 or a 9 % green shift in the past 10 years .\nThis was accelerated by the shift away from nuclear power triggered by the Fukushima nuclear disaster on March 11 , 2011 ; prior to Fukushima , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity sourced from WWS in Japan for the previous decade .\nIn 2019 , Japan \u2019 s electric power generation reached 1.036 trillion kWh ( 1,036 TWh ) .\nOf this , thermal sources accounted for 71 % ( NG 35 % , coal 32 % , oil 4 % ) , renewable ( WWS ) for 19 % , and nuclear for 6 % .\nIn the US thermal power generation has remained dominant , with nuclear also continuing to make a major contribution to GHG reduction .\nIn the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3b , thermal ( coal-fired ) electricity generation dropped below that of nuclear power in 2020 , giving the US a fresh aspect of decarbonization .\nNG remains the principal source of electricity , giving the following breakdown for the US .\nFig .\n3a .\nPower Generation in the US , 2000 to 2020 Figure 3b .\nUS net electricity generation by source , 1990 to 2020 Fig .\n3a reveals that the US power generation system has reached a relatively stable level of 4,000 TWh over the past decade ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly double the US level ) , with the share of electricity generated from WWS sources reaching 19 % by 2020 \u2013 compared with 27 % for the case of China and 34 % for the EU .\nIn the US the share of electricity produced from thermal sources was around 63 % , from nuclear sources 20 % and the balance of 17 % from WWS sources in 2019.2 Non-carbon sources of electricity in the US ( nuclear + WWS ) amount to 39 % .\nWhen we turn to China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative perspective .\nChina has built an enormous power system to drive its expansion of manufacturing industry , now the largest in the world .\nInitially this was based largely on coal , with oil imports targeted at transport .\nChina \u2019 s dependence on coal appears to have plateaued and is now falling slightly each year .\nBased on newly published data from the China Energy Council , in this article we update our previous analyses of China \u2019 s energy choices.3 Our fundamental chart ( Fig .\n4 ) reveals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power generation has now lasted for 13 years of continuous change , since the year 2007 .\nThe newly updated chart reveals that in terms of electricity generated , the proportion of electricity generated from WWS sources has risen from 17 % in 2011 to 27 % in 2020 , or a 10 % green shift in 10 years .\nOver the 13-year span from 2007 to 2020 , the green shift has been continuous , amounting to a green shift of 12 % from WWS ( up from 15 % in 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The green shift in terms of electrical generating capacity is even more striking.4 In terms of generating capacity , China \u2019 s proportion of power capacity sourced from water , wind and sun ( WWS ) reached 41 % in 2020 , up from 20 % in 2007 \u2013 or a 21 % green shift in generating capacity over 13 years .\nThis amounts to an average of 1.6 % per year for the past 13 years .\nIf continued at this rate ( and all policy positions indicate that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of 50 % generating capacity sourced from WWS by 2026 at the latest.5 By that time China \u2019 s electric power system would be more green than black \u2013 a fundamental tipping point that would have ramifications throughout the economy .\nThese are surprising results in themselves , considering that the Chinese electric power system is now the largest in the world .\n( China \u2019 s electric power generation in 2020 reached 7,623 TWh , compared with US total generation of 4,000 TWh . )\nWhat is even more remarkable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be continuous over the last 13 years , overwhelming any reversion to coal-fired power particularly in recent years .\nNevertheless China \u2019 s carbon emissions continue to rise , indicating that the country \u2019 s decarbonization is not proceeding fast enough .\nChina has clear energy goals of electrification of the economy and greening of its electric power system , combined with dematerialization in the sense that materials are increasingly sourced from circular flows ( urban mining and recycling ) .\nThe significance of these goals for China itself and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the international consultancy Wood Mackenzie.6 The detailed results for China \u2019 s power generation over the past 10 years are given in Table 1 , updated to include results for 2020 .\nTable 1A reveals that China \u2019 s electric power system is still dominated by fossil fuels , particularly coal .\nIn 2020 coal-fired power ( thermal power ) of 1,245 GW accounted for 57 % of China \u2019 s electric capacity \u2013 but it has been decreasing at 1.5 % per year and is unlikely to expand much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the 50 % tipping point by 2025 , and certainly before 2027 .\nAccording to Yin Linlin , Director of the Power Fuel Division of CEC \u2019 s Department of Industrial Planning , Environment and Resources , while China is endeavouring to control the installed capacity of coal power below 1,250 GW , those of wind and solar will each exceed 400 GW by 2025 , thus non-fossil energy installed capacity will account for nearly 50 % .7 The total electric power generating system reached 2,200 GW ( i.e .\n2.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new capacity added in 2020 , coal-fired power ( thermal power ) accounted for 54 GW of new capacity , while hydro accounted for 14 GW , wind for 72 GW and solar for 48 GW \u2013 making an addition of 134 GW from WWS sources .\nSo the new capacity added from WWS ( green ) sources at 134 GW was three times the capacity addition from thermal ( black ) sources.8 This is why we can say that the Chinese electric power system continues to green faster than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from WWS sources .\nTable 1 reveals that China has been expanding its reliance on nuclear power in the generation of electric power .\nIn terms of electricity generated , nuclear power has increased from 75 TWh in 2010 to 366 TWh in 2020 , or a fivefold increase over the decade .\nIn terms of capacity addition , nuclear was increased from 11 GW in 2010 to 50 GW in 2020 , or an increase of 450 % over the decade .\nBut the Table also reveals that nuclear is significantly overshadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electric power .\nIn terms of electricity generated , nuclear rose from 2 % of electricity generated in 2010 to 5 % in 2020 , while in terms of capacity it was even less significant , rising from 1 % of electric capacity in 2010 to 2 % in 2020 .\nAt these levels , China looks to emulate the US , Japan and the EU in terms of reliance on nuclear \u2013 but in a way that fails to keep up with the faster rising proportion of green electric power .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s total power system has doubled in terms of capacity over the past decade ( expanding from 966 GW in 2010 to 2200 GW ( 2.2 TW ) in 2020 , while continuing its relentless greening .\nTotal electric capacity sourced from WWS reached 905 GW by 2020 \u2013 which means that it can be anticipated to reach the milestone of 1000 GW ( or 1 terawatt ( TW ) ) within the next year .\nChina would be the first major industrial country to reach terawatt level for green sources of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the second terawatt of green power can be anticipated to be much shorter than the time needed to reach this first terawatt \u2013 such is the nature of cumulative exponential expansion .\nThese green targets are reinforced by the statement from China \u2019 s president , Xi Jinping , in December 2020 of new Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ( INDCs ) to reaching global climate targets , where China announced that wind and solar generating capacity combined would reach 1,200 GW ( 1.2 TW ) by 2030.9 The data presented above would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within reach .\nThe data on investment provided in Table 1C replicate the same story of a continuous green shift .\nInvestment in green sources of power reached RMB 431 billion in 2020 which at an exchange rate of 0.15 would translate to US $ 64.7 billion \u2013 allocated as RMB 108 bn for hydro , RMB 262 bn for wind and RMB 61 bn for solar .\nThese totals far exceed the RMB 55 billion allocated to investment in thermal ( coal-fired ) sources \u2013 which translates to US $ 8.3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources in 2020 was about eight times investment in black sources ( US $ 64.7 billion for green sources as compared with just $ 8.3 billion for black ) is another strong indicator of the continuing green trend .\nThe investment data also reveal a falling reliance on nuclear power , with investment falling from 16 % of total investment in 2010 down to 12 % in 2020 .\nFig .\n6 shows the rise in annual generating capacity increases over the past 30 years , and the relentless rise of capacity growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WWS sources have constituted over 50 % of the annual capacity addition .\nIn 2020 , the proportion of electric capacity added in the year attributed to WWS sources reached 71 % .\nFig .\n7 shows the electricity generated from all sources each year over the past 30 years , allowing for a comparison between electricity generated from thermal sources as compared with that generated from WWS sources , 1990 to 2020 .\nTotal electricity generated reached 7623 TWh ( billion kWh ) in 2020 , with 5174 TWh coming from thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources .\nThe RHS reveals that this generation of power from WWS sources now accounts for 27 % of total electricity generated .\nThis reveals what a huge struggle it has been for green power to overhaul black power in a colossal system experiencing rapid expansion like the Chinese .\nNext , fig .\n8 on the coal-fired power system reveals just how enormous it continues to be .\nThe coal-fired plants generated 5,174 TWh power in 2020 .\nHowever , the total coal consumption is estimated to have dropped 0.8 % down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data from January to October 2020.10 According to the preliminary accounting of National Bureau of Statistics of China , the share of coal in the total energy consumption decreased 1 % from 2019 to 56.7 % in 2020.11 A different angle on China \u2019 s greening of its electric power system is its imports of fossil fuels , measured in tonnes , as shown in Fig .\n9 .\nIn 2020 China was the world \u2019 s largest importer of oil ( used mostly in transport ) with natural gas imports growing marginally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCoal imports have remained stable at just over 300 million tonnes imported in 2020 .\nWe have consistently viewed the high level of dependence of China on fossil fuel imports as one of the principal drivers of its green shift in electric power generation .\nThe rise in fossil fuel imports gives rise to pressure to produce energy in China from manufactured devices , such as wind turbines , solar cells and energy storage devices like batteries , all of which involve electrification and are under domestic control .\nThis is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a quite different energy paradigm in China , one that departs from dependence on fossil fuels and instead enhances reliance on electrification and manufacturing .\nChina \u2019 s greening of its electric power system has yet to be reflected in the data on its carbon emissions , which continue to rise , albeit in moderated fashion .\nFigure 10 on carbon emissions reveals the pattern over the past decade .\nFigure 10 .\nChina and US : Emissions of carbon dioxide per year , 2010 to 2020 Emissions of carbon dioxide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have increased from 10.9 GtCO2/year in 2010 to 13.5 GtCO2/year in 2020 , revealing that China has yet to reach the critical turning point where carbon emissions start to decline .\nBut the increases are falling , and this tipping point can be anticipated to be reached in the near future , and certainly earlier than the 2030 target specified by China \u2019 s leadership .\nDuring the same period , emissions of the US were in the range between 6.5 and 7 GtCO2/year .\nIn terms of per capita emissions , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.2 tons in 2010 and 9.6 tons in 2020 ) , which were less than 50 % of the US levels throughout the decade .\nFinally we put these China data on the greening of electric power in the setting that China leads the world in the pace of its electrification .\nAs shown in Fig .\n11 , China has been expanding its electrical power system as a proportion of its total energy consumption , substituting electrical energy for direct combustion of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , gas ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sectors as well .\nFrom a low base starting at around the year 2000 China has built its electrical power system to the point where it overtook the proportional electrified levels of the US and EU by around 2015 ( reaching a proportion of 16 % ) and ultimately caught up with Japan by 2019 ( reaching an electrification level of 18.5 % ) by the beginning of the 2020s .\nChina now stands first in the proportion of its energy consumption supplied by electrical power .\nIt is thus most open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourced from water , wind and sun .\nBut the question remains : which part of the world is moving most rapidly in this greening direction ?\n12 Figure 11 .\nShare of electricity in total energy consumption , China , EU , US , Japan , 2000-2019 The geopolitics of materials needed for the green shift in electric power The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) has recently turned its attention towards the role of \u201c critical raw materials \u201d ( CRMs ) as the world economy gears up to an unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic year 2020 .\nThere are two issues involved .\nFirstly , there are raw materials needed for the operation of energy systems , where both thermal power systems and nuclear systems call for raw materials that have to be mined , and thereby set a limit to renewability \u2013 as contrasted with power generated based on water , wind and sun which are all continuously renewed .\nAnd secondly there are raw materials needed for the manufacture of green energy equipment ( e.g .\nwind turbines , solar cells , batteries ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nEVs and FCVs ) .\nIt is the latter issue to which the IEA is drawing attention , promising a major review and report on the matter by May 2021.13 Of course of all the major regions China is least likely to be affected by these issues , given its dominance of supply of rare earths and other critical materials needed in manufacture of green technologies , and its progress in promoting recirculation of materials in high-tech industries , which is known in China as \u201c urban mining \u201d .14 We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s green energy choices in comparative perspective without putting them in the context of the country \u2019 s increasing international assertiveness .\nChina is now both seeking international leadership via its Belt and Road Initiative and its recent treaty with the EU even as it moves aggressively to enforce its territorial claims in the South China Sea .\nThe steady expansion of its green power sector can be viewed as one element of its bid for international leadership which is threatened by its aggressive policies elsewhere .\nClearly it would be na\u00efve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of benevolence for the world community .\nOur argument is that China must be perceived as systematically proceeding to green its energy system because it views it as in its national interest to do so .\nMore than other countries , China views a green energy system as one that reduces geopolitical tensions and enhances its energy security as well as drastically reducing carbon particulate pollution in its urban and industrial areas .\nIt is therefore from China \u2019 s perspective worth pursuing as an end in itself .\nPursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by China as one factor in achieving a strong position in building the industries that will dominate energy choices in the 21st century .\nIt is also an aspect of the global economy where the US has abdicated leadership ( especially under Trump ) .\nThat China \u2019 s energy choices reduce global carbon emissions is a favorable by-product of China \u2019 s search for energy security and environmental clean-up .\nThe significance of the energy choices made by China lies in the fact that they reveal how China is inexorably swinging its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the electric power system is being \u201c fuelled \u201d less and less proportionally by fossil fuels and more and more from renewable ( WWS ) sources .\nThis decarbonization trend is complemented by a dematerialization trend where China increasingly sources its industrial materials from circular flows , i.e .\nurban mining and recycling .\nIn this paper we are concerned to point to these trends , as green shoots of a green growth economy \u2013 without losing sight of the fact that China is still the world \u2019 s largest importer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s largest consumer of industrial raw materials like iron ore , aluminium and copper .\nThe significance of this for China is amplified by the fact that such sources are based on devices that are manufactured rather than on materials mined and drilled from the earth \u2013 on solar PV cells , wind turbines , batteries and their associated value chains and cost reductions based on associated learning curves .\nThis is a trend that can be expected to continue.15 In the transport sector the same shift is leading to batteries and EVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all enjoying strong cost reductions associated with the learning curve .\nAnd within these segments themselves , solar PV cells are moving to new generations like eARC PV cells and wind turbines from onshore wind power to offshore wind power , where the turbines are mounted on platforms which also have to be manufactured .\nThese newer generations of devices are all products of manufacturing and innovation , where China plays a key role as a leading patenter of new energy technologies .\nWhat is involved is a revolution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraction of fossil fuels ( with their environmental and geopolitical hazards ) , to one based on manufacturing , complemented by the circulation of materials via recycling and urban mining .\nOf course the specialized material requirements of these green technological shifts are also significant , in terms of rare earths and other industrial materials like copper \u2013 where China \u2019 s innovations in the circular flow economy are helping to redress the balance .\nThe leadership of the EU in engineering a green shift in power generation , as demonstrated in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for leading industrialized countries to stay one step ahead of China in terms of innovation and market capture .\nCommentaries such as the recent Wood Mackenzie report , Tectonic Shift ( cited above ) tend to regard China \u2019 s lead in low-carbon technologies as unassailable \u2013 but the fact of EU leadership in the green shift

the Fukushima Daiichi emergency nuclear power plant into a significant body of water that has already accumulated on the territory of the nuclear power plant .\nThe entire Fukushima Daiichi site is currently lined with these tanks containing more than 1.25 million tons of water still contaminated , despite its purification , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be extracted .\nIt is better to separate the tritium , but the task is incredibly difficult and very expensive .\nIn part , the Japanese tested this technology , but never implemented it .\nAccording to Japanese authorities , the annual level of radioactivity in the area of water discharge from the Fukushima Daiichi will be up to 0.62 microsieverts in seawater and 1.3 microsieverts in the atmosphere , which supposedly falls within the concept of \u201c maximum permissible concentration \u201d .\nHowever , due to the consequences of the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ingress of radioactive substances into the environment , and without the discharge of this water , negative consequences have already been noted .\nIn 2018 , American wine from California was found to contain radioactive particles from the accident at Japanese nuclear power plant Fukushima .\nSmall amounts of radioactive isotopes of Iodine and Cesium were also found in vegetables grown in South Korea and in fish caught off the Japanese coast .\nAccording to experts , the radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi emergency nuclear power plant , although partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as a result of eating ocean fish , will cause additional internal radiation , which is many times more harmful than external .\nThe logic of the Japanese authorities is clearly erroneous and fairly common for any nuclear industry enterprise , which is that the Pacific Ocean is huge , and the concentration of those radionuclides that remain in the tanks when diluted will drop .\nHowever , for humans , such radionuclides in the environment pose a great danger , since , entering the food chain , and , ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause internal radiation .\nAnd it is responsible for most diseases .\nAfter Japan does pour radioactive water into the ocean , life on the planet will become even more dangerous , and not only in Japan .\nThe Japanese themselves should know this first of all , since the population of this country has already suffered as a result of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US Air Force , the subsequent radioactive contamination of the country and its environment .\nAccording to the structure of the currents , @ @ @ @ @ @

Fukushima Prefecture , especially the All Japan Fishing Cooperatives Association , despite the \u201c reassuring statements \u201d of the country \u2019 s authorities , oppose this dump .\nAlso , deep concern on this issue was expressed by the states neighboring with Japan , in particular , China , South Korea , Russia .\nThe head of the South Korean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ku Yun Chol , at a briefing on April 12 , in particular , said : He also said that South Korea has long banned seafood imports from eight prefectures near Fukushima and is generally conducting a thorough scrutiny of all seafood .\nIn recent months , the verification procedure and tracking measures for the entry of radioactive products into the country have been strengthened , and now South Korea will even more closely monitor the place of production of all imported seafood and check their level of radioactivity .\nKu Yun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthen coordination on this issue with international organizations such as the IAEA and the WTO .\nThe sharply negative reaction of the Chinese authorities to Japan \u2019 s decision to discharge purified water from Fukushima Daiichi was expressed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a statement on April 12 : \u201c Such actions testify to extreme irresponsibility , they cause serious damage to health and threaten the safety of the population of neighboring states.\n\u201d As emphasized by the Chinese diplomatic department , such unilateral actions by the Japanese side \u201c can lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Ocean and lead to genetic disorders.\n\u201d The Japanese media have long reported on Japanese authorities preparing a decision on the prompt discharge of purified water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in order to have time to do this even before the start of the Olympic Games in Japan .\nIn this regard , it is appropriate to recall that the decision to hold and postpone the Olympic Games in Japan until the summer of 2021 was made last year after the assurances of the Prime Minister of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that the situation after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is controlled by the Japanese government .\nStating that radioactive water would have to be dumped into the Pacific Ocean in the current climate would be an extremely unfortunate option today , as it would , at the very least , lead to a heated discussion about the health of athletes who will be arriving for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics .\nSurfers , for example , planned to compete for medals 250 kilometers south of Fukushima in Tsurigasaki in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitions were envisaged less than 60 kilometers from the nuclear power plant .\nThe Tokyo Olympics have been famously postponed from the summer of 2020 to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic .\nIt was planned that in 2021 the competition will be held in Japan from July 23 to August 8 .\nHowever , according to Kyodo , which recently conducted a social survey of residents about the holding of the Olympics in Tokyo , most Japanese residents oppose its holding in 2021 .\n39 % of the Japanese surveyed were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 33 % were in favor of postponing the Olympics .\nOnly 24.5 % of Japanese residents are positive about the fact that thousands of athletes from all over the world will come to the Japanese capital in the summer of 2021 .\nIn these conditions , the new Japanese government , balancing on the mood of the population of its country , has been looking for an opportunity for several months to find an objective reason for canceling the Olympic Games and report it \u201c without losing face.\n\u201d Finally , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing responsible sources , the Japanese government is still tacitly inclined to the decision to cancel the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo \u201c because of the Covid-19 pandemic \u201d , intending , nevertheless , to claim the right to hosting the 2032 Games .\nSince a decision is being made to refuse to host the Olympic Games , then the decision to dump water from the storage tanks of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant did not wait long in the minds of representatives of the Japanese

specific plan to regulate marine plastic waste at a regional level .\nEach nation seems to have its own policy to manage waste in its territory .\nIn Malaysia , the government has already imposed a ban on non-biodegradable plastics .\nThe Thai government is actively discussing the possibility of a tax on waste .\nOther countries , such as Singapore and Vietnam , have already declared national commitments to tackle marine plastic waste .\nIndonesia is currently enhancing waste recycling technology and developing garbage-collecting vessels .\nIn addition to each nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASEAN should set up a regional action plan comprising common actions to reduce plastics in the oceans .\nTo ensure its effectiveness , we recommend these actions should be monitored and reported in the ASEAN high-level meeting as the ASEAN countries do not only receive waste from their own territories , but also from other countries in the world .\nWhile the region , dominated by highly populated developing nations , is still struggling to reduce plastic wastes on land , they also need to solve the problem of marine waste from neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their coastal areas .\nA regional action plan could strengthen the ASEAN legacy on marine plastic and provide a model for global action .\nWe recommend collaboration between ASEAN nations to enhance waste-recycling technology .\nThis is very important because our wastes are different from those of European countries or the US .\nWith strong partnerships and management , this technology could be available to manage waste in the

top banner of our home page ( Desktop version ) .\nChanges are taking place in Australian foreign policy .\nThe country is tending towards a tougher stance in defense of Western interests and plans to cease important strategic ties with China and other nations not aligned to the West .\nWhile this type of stance is expected from a country with strong historical ties to Western powers , such as Australia , it is possible that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multipolar world , such radical measures will harm Australia \u2019 s own interests .\nThe Australian federal government intervened in an abusive way in the autonomy of the states last Wednesday , by unilaterally canceling four international agreements that the state of Victoria had with other countries .\nThe agreements canceled by the Australian government were : a memorandum of understanding between Victoria and the Chinese State with the promise of mutual work on road infrastructure for the Belt and Road Initiative ; the mutual promise to create a working group to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia ; another memorandum of understanding , signed with the Iranian Ministry of Labor in 2004 , seeking cooperation on labor issues and ; a scientific cooperation protocol with the Syrian Ministry of Higher Education , in force since 1999 .\nAs we can see , two of these agreements were signed between Victoria and the Chinese government , having been in force since 2018 and 2019 with the aim of integrating the Australian state into Xi Jinping \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative .\nRegardless of the ideological stance of the Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering that the agreements benefited Australia economically without any prejudice to the ideological issue .\nThe main criticisms that Australian experts have made against the agreements with China refer to the fact that the state of Victoria has not tried to negotiate better environmental , labor , and democratic conditions for cooperation .\nIn other words , what the critics of the agreements say is that the state has not tried to impose Western values \u200b\u200bon China in exchange for cooperation \u2013 which is absolutely understandable : the purpose of the agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe initiative for the cancellation was taken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Marise Payne , who believes in the total incompatibility between Australian diplomacy and economic cooperation with China , as evidenced by her words : \u201c I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia \u2019 s foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations \u201d .\nIn fact , this Australian foreign policy orientation is not really new .\nThe total alignment between Australia and the other Western powers has undermined bilateral relations with China since 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian 5G technology market , giving Western companies commercial priority .\nShortly thereafter , with the start of the pandemic , Prime Minister Scott Morrison also made allegations of anti-scientific and xenophobic content when requesting investigations on the origin of the new coronavirus , suggesting at a possible artificial origin in China .\nIndeed , the Australian stance on China has been one of the most radical in the whole world , being a true frontal opposition .\nFor example , few countries have adhered to Washington \u2019 s plans to undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canberra \u2019 s position a full and unrestricted support for the U.S. \u2013 support that , as we can see , was unaffected by the American presidential transition , showing an episode of automatic alignment .\nChina immediately responded to the Australian attitude by repudiating notes at the Embassy in Canberra , where it was said that : \u201c This is another unreasonable and provocative move taken by the Australian side against China .\n( \u2026 ) It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations .\n( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations , and will only end up hurting itself \u201d .\nNo retaliatory measures have been taken by the Chinese government to date , but bilateral relations have evidently become more fragile and unstable .\nChinese international praxis is not retaliatory , generally seeking only mutual economic benefits with the nations with which it makes agreements .\nChinese ideology , although very strong in internal decision-making , is almost null when it comes to Beijing \u2019 s diplomacy .\nTherefore , it is possible that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without taking equivalent measures that further worsen ties .\nThe drop in ties between China and Australia will not affect Beijing so strongly as it will with Canberra , which will increasingly lose Chinese capital \u2019 s share in its economy .\nThe Chinese are Australia \u2019 s largest trading partners , in addition to great scientific cooperation , with the majority of exchange students on Australian soil having Chinese nationality .\nCertainly , the stance of the federal government will also generate internal tensions as not all states are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet the ideological desires of the federal government .\nThis is precisely the case in the state of Victoria , where , with the agreements , Labor Premier Dan Andrews had consented to China \u2019 s development and infrastructure initiatives as a way to bring Australia and the whole of Oceania closer to the integration between Asia , Europe and Africa promoted by Beijing .\nVictoria is a real pillar of the Australian economy , being the second richest state in the country .\nA crisis of interest between Victoria and Canberra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nStill , it is important to note that Australia is part of the RCEP , which should mean a greater willingness to negotiate with Beijing , despite political antagonism , but Morrison \u2019 s liberal government is obstinate in its hostile stance .\nIt is possible that new measures will emerge against China , Iran , and Syria .\nBut Beijing remains the biggest target .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward

combination of which perfectly illustrated the difficult situation in which Seoul finds itself amid the standoff between Beijing and Washington .\nOn the one hand , the US is South Korea \u2019 s main military and political ally , and the policy of rebuilding alliances that the new President Biden has addressed is trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington-Tokyo-Seoul triangle , both on the North Korean issue and in terms of \u201c deterring \u201d China .\nOn the other hand , China is North Korea \u2019 s leading trading partner , and interaction with it has a chance to push North Korea toward inter-Korean cooperation .\nThe South Korean media often compares the country \u2019 s policy to walking on a tightrope , as Seoul wants to avoid spoiling relations with either side .\nNaturally , this requires having good relations with everyone .\nIn a demonstrative manifestation of this policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Chung Eui-yong met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and National Security Adviser Suh Hoon arrived for a private meeting with his counterparts from the United States and Japan .\nLet \u2019 s start with the visit to China .\nOn April 2-3 , Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong visited Xiamen , China , at the invitation of the Chinese side .\nThe foreign minister was last in China in November 2017 , and the meeting of foreign ministers of the two countries took place for the first time since November 2020 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign minister told reporters that cooperating with China to make progress in Seoul \u2019 s efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula is \u201c very important , \u201d and noted that discussions between Korea and China on the matter are going wel .\nThe talks were expected to discuss cooperation between Seoul and Beijing in preventing escalation of tensions in the region , high-level exchanges ( including the possibility of a visit to Seoul by Chinese President Xi Jinping ) and preparations for events marking the 30th anniversary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in 2022 .\nIn addition , Chung Eui-yong and Wang Yi were going to touch on US policy toward the DPRK and its provocative actions , as well as China \u2019 s involvement in building lasting peace in the region , since the resumption of denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea in the near future is unlikely after Pyongyang \u2019 s recent launches of short-range ballistic missiles .\nConservatives immediately criticized the visit .\nJoongAng Ilbo noted that the first thing most Korean foreign ministers did after taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chung , on the other hand , goes to China , which shows how much importance the Moon Jae-in administration attaches to China .\nIf the Korean diplomat does not behave assertively , \u201c Korea could be pried away from its decades-old alliance and be subjugated to China \u201d .\nAt the ministerial meeting , Wang Yi stated that \u201c South Korea and China are strategic partners and have common or similar positions on preservation of regional peace and stability , pursuit of co-development and security of global governance \u201d .\nCalling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of strategic communication between Seoul and Beijing and said the talks were very timely .\nWang pointed out that the two sides favor \u201c openness and inclusiveness \u201d , pledging to \u201c maintain an international order based on international law and to work together to protect multilateralism and expand common interests \u201d .\nRegarding the DPRK , Wang added that \u201c China , along with South Korea , will strive for a process of political settlement of the Korean Peninsula problem through dialogue \u201d .\nChung Eui-yong also stressed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .\nAs for the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea , the sides agreed to achieve this \u201c as soon as the situation with COVID-19 stabilizes \u201d .\nThough , there was no mention of this in China \u2019 s final statement .\nChung and Wang also agreed to \u201c continuously explore cooperation between South Korea \u2019 s regional policy initiatives and China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative \u201d .\nIn addition , they agreed to establish a joint committee in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadmap for the future development of relations between the two countries , since next year Seoul and Beijing will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of their ties .\nThe ministers also agreed to seek a strategic dialogue at the level of deputy foreign ministers and a \u201c 2+2 \u201d meeting involving diplomatic and security officials in the first half of this year .\nThe Korea Times noted in this regard that Seoul is trying to enlist Beijing \u2019 s cooperation in order to revive the stalled denuclearization talks between Pyongyang and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since China is the only country that can still exert influence on the North .\nHowever , it is unclear whether the US and China are willing to cooperate with each other on global issues of common concern , such as the North Korean nuclear issue .\nGiven the escalating rivalry between the G2 , the prospects for their cooperation are not bright .\nThis is all the more so when Washington is doubling down on forming an anti-China alliance .\nBiden is trying to expand the informal Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crucial for Seoul to maintain a balance between Washington and Beijing so as not to get caught in the crossfire .\nThe more conservative Korea Herald mentioned that Wang Yi allegedly said that \u201c North Korea \u2019 s reasonable anxiety about its security must be addressed \u201d .\nAccording to the newspaper , this means that Beijing wants to preserve the ruling regime of the DPRK , and that the sanctions against the North must be eased .\nIn this context , \u201c it is questionable if Beijing will play a helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now about the trip to America .\nThe meeting between Suh Hoon , Jake Sullivan and Shigeru Kitamura took place face-to-face at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis ( symbolically , experts say ) near Washington , and Suh Hoon became the first high-ranking South Korean official to visit the United States since the creation of the Joe Biden government .\nAccording to National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horn , the meeting provided \u201c an opportunity for our nations to consult on a wide range of regional issues and foreign policy priorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean Peninsula , addressing the COVID-19 pandemic , and combating climate change.\n\u201d The multilateral dialogue at the level of national security advisors \u201c reflects the importance we place on broadening and deepening our cooperation on key issues and advancing our shared prosperity across a free and open Indo-Pacific \u201d .\nJust in time for the final formation of a new policy on the DPRK , which the allies have a chance to influence or at least have a say in .\nAccording to Suh Hoon , South Korea , Japan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency of the North Korean nuclear issue and the need for a diplomatic solution to the issue , \u201d reiterating their joint efforts to resume denuclearization talks with Pyongyang as soon as possible .\n\u201c The US side explained the interim outcome of the ongoing North Korea policy review , and the security advisers of South Korea , the US and Japan held in-depth discussions on various issues related to preparations and implementation of measures for negotiations with North Korea \u201d .\nAlso , \u201c South Korea , the US and Japan also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreed to strengthen their cooperation based on their shared values \u201d .\nThe last phrase is very important for the author : recall Pompeo \u2019 s and others \u2019 statements that the confrontation between the US and China is not political , but a value-based confrontation : freedom versus totalitarianism .\nOf course , \u201c agreed to strengthen \u201d means that there is no full-fledged cooperation yet , but Suh Hoon believes that \u201c the three countries were able to hold strategic dialogue on various issues of mutual interest through this trilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , in its statement following the meeting , highlighted something slightly different .\nThe advisers \u201c shared their concerns about North Korea \u2019 s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and reaffirmed their commitment to address and resolve these issues through concerted trilateral cooperation towards denuclearization \u201d .\nThey also stressed the need for full compliance with UN Security Council resolutions prohibiting any nuclear or ballistic missile tests by the North and \u201c reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to working together to protect and advance their shared security goals \u201d .\nThe importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swift resolution of the abductions issue \u201d was specifically mentioned .\nAlmost the same wording , including \u201c cooperation based on shared values , \u201d appeared in the joint statement at the end of the meeting : \u201c a commitment to cooperation and joint action to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem , \u201d \u201c concern over Pyongyang \u2019 s continued nuclear and missile programs , \u201d and \u201c the need for full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions \u201d .\nNevertheless , \u201c efforts to resume negotiations between North Korea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , \u201d and it is claimed that this phrase was included in the text of the statement at the request of Suh .\nIn addition to the general meeting , the ROK representative met with each of the vis-a-vis individually .\nIn bilateral talks with Sullivan , Suh said he emphasized the positive impact of good inter-Korean relations on denuclearization talks with the North .\nHowever , he also noted the importance of a \u201c coordinated strategy between South Korea and the United States \u201d .\nIn this context , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side \u201c explained the progress made so far regarding North Korea and agreed to continue consultations throughout the remainder of the process \u201d .\nIn other words , the general line was explained to Seoul .\nBut they agreed to listen .\nBut Seoul and Washington have reached an \u201c agreement in principle \u201d to hold a summit between the presidents of the ROK and the US .\nWithout setting an exact date , the parties agreed to hold the summit as early as possible .\nSuh also held bilateral talks with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Japan agreed to play a constructive and active role in the process of reviewing US policy toward North Korea and agreed on the importance of cooperation between South Korea , the United States and Japan to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue \u201d .\nThe wording is rather vague , considering that before the visit , the ROK media wrote that \u201c during the meeting with Shigeru Kitamura , chairman of Japan \u2019 s National Security Council , joint measures by Seoul and Tokyo to establish sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen , in both cases the sides announced that the negotiations went well , but the visible results are seen in areas of little significance , because the big issues remained here and there .\nIn fact , both meetings discussed regional security issues , including the North Korean issue , and in both China and America , South Korean officials demonstrated a constructive and positive approach .\nIn both cases , however , the affair ended with general statements of willingness to cooperate and little specifics about the areas of minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the media coverage of the two visits , the English-language media in the ROK , which has a more conservative orientation , was much more critical of the trip to China than of the trip to America .\nFrom the point of view of conservatives , who constantly accuse Moon of cryptocommunism and pro-Chinese politics , \u201c It is high time for Seoul to stop groveling to Beijing and remember who its main ally is \u201d .\nA similar position , albeit for different reasons , is held by supporters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we consider the trouble that one side would cause if Seoul were to join the other , although China has shown its teeth in the wake of the ROK \u2019 s decision to host THAAD , the United States \u2019 grip could be much stronger , even in terms of a possible trade war .\nNevertheless , while Seoul desperately tries to sit on two parting chairs , already preparing to use the cross twine , the author watches with interest to see how such acrobatics will end

Research articles can be read in 51 languages by activating the \u201c Translate Website \u201d drop down menu on the top banner of our home page ( Desktop version ) .\nIndonesia has laid out an ambitious plan to tackle deforestation , the main factor contributing to the country being one of the top global greenhouse gas emitters .\nBut experts have panned its goals as unrealistic , given the true state of forest loss in the country .\nUnder the plan recently announced by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and due to be submitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( UNFCCC ) in April , the government proposes three scenarios for emissions reduction , with differing levels of ambition .\nThe most ambitious scenario calls for more than halving the deforestation rate over the next three decades as well as reforesting 10.6 million hectares ( 26.2 million acres ) of land by 2050 .\nOn this trajectory , the country \u2019 s forests are expected to become a net carbon sink by 2030 , capable of absorbing 304 million tons of CO2e per year .\nThis will be key in Indonesia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070 .\nForestry experts say they aren \u2019 t convinced , however , pointing out that the country is already on track to vastly overshoot the most ambitious target .\nUnder that scenario , the government envisions capping the deforestation rate at 241,000 hectares ( 595,500 acres ) from 2010 to 2030 , and 99,000 hectares ( 244,600 acres ) from 2031 to 2050 .\nThat means that , between 2010 and 2030 , the maximum allowable deforestation is 4.82 million hectares ( 11.9 million acres ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that period , the country had lost 4.71 million hectares ( 11.6 million acres ) of forest , according to official data .\nAt this rate , Indonesia can \u2019 t afford to lose any more forest from now on , according to Yosi Amelia , the forest and climate program officer at environmental NGO Madani .\nThe problem , though , is that a certain level of deforestation is baked into all three government scenarios , from 14.64 million hectares ( 36.2 million acres ) under the least ambitious one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) under the most ambitious .\nThe latter figure alone represents an area the size of Ireland .\nThe government touts last year \u2019 s figure of 115,459 hectares ( 285,300 acres ) of deforestation \u2014 the lowest since it began keeping track of forest loss in 1990 \u2014 as evidence that it can keep pushing the rate to manageable levels .\nBut even if the policies that the government credits for that decline are maintained , the country is still on track to lose a further 55 million hectares ( 135.9 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Dodik Ridho Nurrochmat , a professor of forest policy at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture ( IPB ) .\nBringing down the deforestation rate to the level that the government envisions in any of its scenarios will be \u201c very difficult based on our calculation , \u201d Dodik said in a recent online discussion .\n\u201c Even though the trend [ of deforestation ] is in a decline , the decline will be small and level off later .\nPeat forest cleared for acacia plantaton in Sumatra , Indonesia .\nImage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s the perennial problem of how Indonesia calculates its deforestation rate .\nPlantations of acacia and eucalyptus that are cultivated to make paper and wood pulp are currently counted as forest \u2014 even though massive swaths of peatland and primary forest were cleared to make way for these plantations .\nThat \u2019 s what makes the government \u2019 s \u201c record low \u201d deforestation rate in 2020 so misleading : most of the decline came from a drop in harvesting of pulpwood trees , says Yosi from Madani .\nHarvesting in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deforestation rate in 2019 , but plunged by 99 % in 2020 .\nAt the same time , actual deforestation of actual natural forests declined by only 38 % .\nYosi said this might have to do with the

the appointment of its new special representative on Korean Peninsula affairs\u2014Ambassador Liu Xiaoming .\nAmb .\nLiu \u2019 s career has been most notable for two things : he was the Chinese

United Kingdom ) in the history of People \u2019 s Republic of China ( PRC ) , skillfully navigating a turbulent ten years of China \u2019 s foreign policy .\nThe choice for this assignment shows Beijing \u2019 s desire to entrust this delicate issue to a veteran diplomat with rich experience in Pyongyang .\nHowever , what \u2019 s more interesting is the timing and message this appointment sends , suggesting China sees renewed diplomacy on the horizon .\nThe office of the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up in 2003 under a slightly different title\u2014ambassador on Korean Peninsula affairs\u2014and tasked with diplomatic engagement with parties related to the Six Party Talks .\nFrom 2003 to 2011 , the position was kept at a director-general level and filled by Ambassador Ning Fukui , Li Bin , Chen Naiqing , and Yang Houlan consecutively .\nIn early 2010 , China elevated the office to the \u201c special representative on Korean Peninsula affairs \u201d and its ranking from the director-general level to the vice-ministerial level .\nThe first special representative was Ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s vice foreign minister since 2004 .\nHe was in the position for seven and a half years until handing the torch over to Ambassador Kong Xuanyou , assistant foreign minister , in August 2017 .\nAmbassador Kong was promoted to vice foreign minister in January of 2018 and appointed Chinese ambassador to Japan in May 2019 .\nSince then , the position for the special representative on Korean Peninsula affairs has been vacant .\nIn June 2019 , the Chinese Foreign Ministry acknowledged that \u201c China will select a qualified person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will release information when it becomes available , \u201d although no appointment followed .\n[ 1 ] Timing of the New Appointment The fact that the special envoy \u2019 s position was kept vacant for two years and has been filled only now carries important connotations .\nAfter the Hanoi Summit in 2019 , US-DPRK bilateral engagement fell into an abysmal stalemate over disagreements about what concrete actions North Korea should take on the denuclearization front and what the US should provide in return .\nDuring that period , diplomacy was kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other parties , including China , was minimal .\nUnder those circumstances , there was no pressing need for China to appoint a new special envoy , especially given Beijing \u2019 s relatively high confidence that the bilateral engagement between the US and North Korea would not render the result Washington desired .\nThis has been particularly true since the outbreak of the pandemic , which completely shifted the attention of both North Korea and the US to domestic affairs .\nThis context makes China \u2019 s appointment of a new special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction in Beijing that as the Biden administration \u2019 s North Korea policy review nears completion , the resumption of diplomacy is on the horizon , either bilaterally between the US and China over pressure and incentives needed for the DPRK to return to the negotiation table , or multilaterally with China involved .\nEarly signs suggest that Washington is inclined to reach out to Beijing for assistance and cooperation on North Korea , including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2019 s call last month for China to use its \u201c tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denuclearize .\nWhile the US and China still have vastly different visions for the endgame on the Korean Peninsula , making it highly unlikely that the two can reach a consensus at the strategic level on North Korea , working-level cooperation at the technical level remains possible .\nBeijing is willing to leverage its North Korea card in its bargaining with Washington , and this new assignment appears to be its attempt to prepare for such cooperation .\nThat is perhaps the most essential message embedded in the new appointment .\nThe appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel shifts in Sino-DPRK relations .\nIn February , North Korea just replaced 79-year-old Ji Jae Ryong with former deputy premier and foreign trade specialist , 60-year-old Ri Ryong Nam , as its ambassador to China .\nThe generational change is reportedly to be followed suit by China \u2019 s replacement of 64-year-old Ambassador Li Jinjun with 51-year-old Wang Yajun\u2014the youngest vice-ministerial-level official in China \u2019 s foreign policy apparatus\u2014as its top diplomat in Pyongyang ( the news of the appointment has been out although the actual replacement has not happened due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel shifts could indicate the different priorities Beijing and Pyongyang are using to gauge bilateral relations .\nOn the one hand , both Li and Wang have been the deputy chief of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCID ) .\nIn fact , the position of Chinese ambassador to North Korea has been consistently occupied by a former deputy chief of the CCID .\nThis illustrates the continued dominance of party-to-party relations , or the theme of political friendship in Sino-DPRK relations .\nOn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of an economic and trade specialist as its top envoy to China highlights the country \u2019 s desire to enhance economic ties and domestic growth , especially after the hardship imposed by the pandemic over the last year .\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty .\nThe Treaty automatically renews every 20 years .\nGiven that no advanced notice for cancellation has been announced by either side , the Treaty will continue for the foreseeable future .\nIn light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions in North Korea , China appears to be ramping up its personnel appointments , resources and efforts to prepare for diplomatic engagement over North Korea .\nThe decisions are strategically timed to echo the completion of the Biden administration \u2019 s North Korea policy review .\nBeijing may not feel the ball is in its court and could wait for Washington to reach out first , but its interest and posturing are fully panned out .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below .\nForward this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your blog site , internet forums .\netc .\nFeatured image is from

, New Delhi \u2019 s attitude toward this organization remains somewhat cautious and it is still seen more as a secondary instrument of India \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia .\nTo some extent , this

Central Asia to develop a major North-South infrastructure corridor designed to expand Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia , Russia and Europe .\nThis 7,200-kilometer multimodal route already takes Indian goods across the Arabian Sea to the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas , from where they move north by road and rail via Iran and Azerbaijan to Russia and Europe .\nUltimately , this project will connect India with Turkey and the Central Asian republics , as well as with the east-west trans-Siberian rail network , allowing access to both EU and Chinese markets .\nIndia \u2019 s strategic interests in Central Asia include access to energy resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepening its regional integration .\nIn an effort to ensure its energy security , India is trying to reduce its overdependence on crude oil from the volatile Persian Gulf region by diversifying its supply through new purchases from Africa , the United States and other sources .\nIn this context , India views access to Central Asian natural oil and gas resources as an important element .\nTurkmenistan , the world \u2019 s fourth-largest source of natural gas , is of particular importance to India in this regard because , amongst

India \u2019 s civilian nuclear power program .\nIn 2019 , India and Uzbekistan , the world \u2019 s seventh-largest uranium exporter , signed a long-term contract to supply uranium .\nStrengthening cooperation between the two states on this basis can lead to an increase in bilateral trade and investment .\nNegotiations on a free trade agreement are actively underway .\nIndia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Suspends Flights from India", "content": "As India is being devastated by COVID-19 cases that have now passed a daily rate of 400,000 , affluent and callous Australia has taken the decision to suspend all flights coming into the country till mid-month .\nThe decision was reached by the Morrison government with the blessing of the State Premiers and the Labor opposition .\nNot happy with banning flights from India , the Morrison government promises to be savage in punishing returnees who find ways to circumvent the ban ( for instance , by travelling via a third country ) .\nCitizens who breach the travel ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment and fines up to AU $ 66,000 .\n\u201c We have taken drastic action to keep Australians safe , \u201d explained the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg .\nThe situation in India was \u201c serious \u201d ; the decision had only been reached after considering the medical advice .\nAccording to a statement from Health Minister Greg Hunt , it was \u201c critical the integrity of the Australian public health and quarantine systems is protected and the number of COVID-19 cases in quarantine is reduced to a manageable level.\n\u201d The decision fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take long for more alert medical practitioners to wonder why the approach to India was being so selectively severe .\nHealth commentator and GP Vyom Sharma thought the decision \u201c incredibly disproportionate to the threat that it posed \u201d .\nSharma is certainly correct on this score in terms of international law , which requires the least restrictive or least intrusive way of protecting citizens .\nThen there was the issue about the previous policies Canberra had adopted to countries suffering from galloping COVID-19 figures .\nA baffled Sharma wondered , \u201c Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban and no people who have come from America ?\n\u201d Former race discrimination commissioner Tim Soutphommasane seconds the suspicions .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t see differential treatment being extended to countries such as the United States , the UK , and any other European country even though the rates of infection were very high and the danger of its arrivals from those countries was very high.\n\u201d The Australian Human Rights Commission has also asked the federal government to justify its actions .\n\u201c The government must show that these measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of dealing with the threat to public health.\n\u201d In the face of such behaviour , aggrieved citizens are left with few legal measures .\nAustralia , among liberal democratic states , is idiosyncratic in refusing to adopt a charter of rights .\nDown Under , parliamentarians are supposedly wise and keen to uphold human rights till they think otherwise .\n( Human rights , the argument goes , would become the fodder of lawyers and judges , interfering with the absolute will of Parliament and the electors . )\nThe Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizenship .\nLeft at the mercy of legislative regulation , Parliament and the executive can be disdainful towards their citizens without consequences .\nOne avenue remains the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Committee .\nOn April 15 , the UNHRC ruled on the case of two petitioners of FreeAndOpenAustralia.org ( formerly StrandedAussies.org ) that the Morrison government had to \u201c facilitate and ensure their prompt return to Australia.\n\u201d Represented by the notable sage of international law Geoffrey Robertson QC , the petitioners argued that Australia was in breach of Articles 12 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .\nThe first article provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country ; the second provides for \u201c effective \u201d remedies to be granted to those whose rights and freedoms have breached under the ICCPR .\nThe petitioners also freely admitted that they had no issue with quarantining for 14 days on returning to Australia .\nIn the words of Free and Open Australia spokesperson Deb Tellis , the Commonwealth should \u201c use its power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caps that are being dictated by the states .\nThere are thousands of our fellow citizens suffering loss of their relatives and loss of their jobs.\n\u201d The government has preferred a meaner , penny pinching approach in coping with quarantine , reducing flights when needed rather than expanding facilities to accommodate a greater number of infected arrivals .\nThe hotel quarantine system continues to receive effusive praise from the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as being 99.99 percent effective .\nBut it is impossible for him , and his ministers , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , and are unwilling , to use other facilities and expand existing ones .\nSince last November , there have been 16 COVID-19 leaks across the cities of Melbourne , Sydney , Brisbane , Adelaide and Perth from quarantine hotels .\nAt this writing , another quarantine leak is being reported in Western Australia , involving the now customarily infected hotel security guard and the inevitable seepage into the community .\nThe problem of airborne transmission continues to plague , as does the uneven provision of Personal Protective Equipment .\nNo national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , with each state adopting its own approach .\nAudits of the ventilation systems in many such hotels remain sketchy .\nWestern Australian Premier Mark McGowan , who recently imposed a lockdown of the Perth and Peel areas and may well do the same thing over the next few days , suggested that the Commonwealth be generous with some of its facilities .\nWhy not use the RAAF Curtin Air Base , or the immigration detention centres of Yongah Hill and Christmas Island ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that could assist , it \u2019 s just that the Commonwealth doesn \u2019 t want to do it.\n\u201d The evidence so far is that facilities such as Howard Springs in the Northern Territory tend to work .\nIt features single-storey cabins , segregated air conditioning systems , outdoor veranda space and , in the vicinity , a fully functioning hospital .\nNo leaks have been recorded .\nAnd location is everything : distant from densely populated areas .\nThis government , however , remains miserly on the score of quarantine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @

down menu on the top banner of our home page ( Desktop version ) .\nEnvironmental activists and local residents have been waging a long-running campaign against a toxic rare-earths refinery in Malaysia run by Lynas Rare Earths , an Australian corporation .\nThey breathed a cautious sigh of relief when it was announced that Lynas \u2019 application for a permanent toxic and radioactive waste dump in a rainforest reserve was rejected in an Environment Impact Assessment ( EIA ) .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c not approved \u201d entry on the environment department \u2019 s website listing EIAs made on April 28 .\nLynas rushed to the media with a claim that this was just a minor delay , based on a technicality , which will be fixed with the submission of new documents .\nLee Tan is an environmental activist who has played a major role \u2014 along with Australian activists \u2014 supporting the strong objections from residents living in Kuantan , a city close to the Lynas refinery .\nTan told Green Left this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , we have managed to stop Lynas from dumping its toxic radioactive waste in Kuantan \u2019 s water catchment .\nHowever , for as long as the radioactive waste remains in Malaysia , we can not let our guard down , \u201d she said .\n\u201c The DOE website clearly states that Lynas \u2019 EIA for the permanent waste dump proposal for Bukit Ketam has been rejected and now Lynas is spinning a new story , I guess to prevent its stock value from crashing .\n\u201c Under Lynas \u2019 licence condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operation to stop more toxic radioactive waste from being piled up further .\nHowever , it might be wishful thinking \u2014 albeit a public and environmental health blessing \u2014 if the government actually enforces the law on Lynas.\n\u201d Earlier this year , Tan explained in an interview with GL that Lynas was seeking to \u201c carve out one of the last remnants of a pristine rainforest for a shallow radioactive waste dump , lined with only a 2 millimetre-thin , high-density polyethylene ( HDPE ) plastic sheet \u201d .\nTan also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exposure to radiation , particularly to elements like thorium and uranium , which were present in the mountain of waste that Lynas has piled up next to its refinery .\n\u201c They might be low-level in terms of radioactivity , but in decaying have very high daughter isotopes like radium , radon , polonium and so forth .\nBecause they have long half-lives , they are radioactive for a long time \u2014 billions of years .\n\u201c As they are practically forever hazardous , the danger comes from ionising radiation when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animal or human .\nThis takes place when they decay in the surviving cells damaging the DNA \u2014 the building blocks of our cells \u2014 if the dose is high enough .\nThis is can be a cumulative process over a lifetime and can even be passed down to future generations.\n\u201d Tan said the proposed waste dump is \u201c in a forest on Bukit Ketam , a hill that is a catchment for two rivers .\nSungai Ara joins Sungai Riau and that flows into the Kuantan River and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two water treatment plants for water supply drawn from this river system.\n\u201d The city of Kuantan uses that river for drinking water , so 90 % of the city \u2019 s population will be drinking water that could be contaminated with toxic elements from the proposed Lynas waste dump .\nMeena Raman , an environmental lawyer and the president of Sahabat Alam Malaysia ( SAM \u2014 Friends of the Earth Malaysia ) told GL that SAM welcomes the DOE \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c One of the main legal points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Environmental Quality Act 1974 of Malaysia , the Director General ( DG ) can not approve an EIA which violates an existing local plan for the area , which is required under the planning law in this country , \u201d Raman said .\n\u201c As noted in the EIA , according to the Kuantan Local Plan ( KLP ) 2035 , the Bukit Kuantan Forest Reserve is considered a Class I ESA ( Environmentally Sensitive Area ) of cultural value ; therefore , no form of development or activities , other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allowed in the area .\n\u201c The State government may have agreed for the project site to be degazetted as a forest reserve for the development of the PDF [ facility ] , but unless the KLP 2035 is amended \u2026 [ it ] continues to be the relevant plan , and the DG can not be considering a future local plan which is non-existent .\n\u201c In the EIA , a letter from the Kuantan Municipal Council has been produced , dated December 22 , 2020 , which states that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into account in the revision of the KLP 2035 .\n\u201c It is presumptuous to assume that the KLP will be amended without objections , or that the objections can be ignored , in the public consultations process .\n\u201c The Court of Appeal has made clear that any deviation from a structure plan ( and in our case , a local plan ) must be for good reason and must be explained and the reasons provided for doing so .\n\u201c Hence , the authorities can be challenged for departing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuantan Forest Reserve as Class 1 ESA .\n\u201c In any event , as we have pointed out before , the Director General \u2019 s decision under Sect 34A ( 4 ) ( a ) of the Environmental Quality Act relates to an existing development plan and not a future plan that has not come into effect .\n\u201c Lynas could appeal the decision of the DG under the EQA but our view is that the DG can not violate the law .\nHence , the chance of Lynas succeeding is rather slim.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental campaigns for the Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) , told GL : \u201c

, Japan \u2019 s ambassador to Australia , Shingo Yamagami , told The Sydney Morning Herald he was \u201c optimistic \u201d about his country coming on board .\n[ I ] would like to see this idea become reality in the near future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its concerns over using the Five Eyes process to pressure China .\nWhat is this spy alliance ?\nAnd what are the benefits and risks to bringing Japan on board ?\nWhat is the Five Eyes ?\nBeginning as an intelligence exchange agreement between the United States and United Kingdom in 1943 , it formally became the UKUSA Agreement in 1946 .\nThe agreement then extended to Canada in 1948 , and Australia and New Zealand in 1956 .\nThis long-running collaboration has been particularly useful for sharing signals intelligence , or intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group \u2019 s focus has shifted over time , from targeting the USSR during the Cold War , to Islamist terrorism after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , to the rising challenge from China today .\nThere is a significant intelligence tradition in Japan .\nAfter the Meiji Restoration of the 19th century , the imperial Japanese army and navy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs developed extensive intelligence networks .\nThese aided the rise of the Japanese empire in its wars against China , Russia and eventually the Western allies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , Japan \u2019 s intelligence services were revamped under American supervision .\nJapan has since been an important base of operations for US intelligence operations in Asia , particularly by military intelligence , the CIA and the National Security Agency .\nThe Japanese intelligence community now comprises a range of services , including the Ministry of Defense \u2019 s Directorate for Signals Intelligence , which provides expertise in regional signals intelligence .\nGiven Japan \u2019 s proximity to China , North Korea , and Russia , Japan may well be an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also a precedence for formal intelligence sharing with the West .\nAs well as its long-running collaboration with the US , an Information Security Agreement was signed between Australia and Japan in 2012 .\nAt the end of 2016 , the US , Japan and Australia signed a similar trilateral agreement deepening the extent of covert security cooperation .\nJapan \u2019 s close relationship to the US is seen in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga \u2019 s visit last week to the US , the first foreign leader to be officially hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington focused heavily on China .\nWhile the Five Eyes group has often cooperated with the intelligence services of Japan on an ad hoc basis \u2014 as well as those of France , Germany and Israel \u2014 there has so far been reluctance among the Five Eyes members to formally broaden the alliance .\nThe US especially has had doubts in the past about the security and reliability of the Japanese intelligence community .\nIn particular , this is due to concerns over its relative lack of overseas experience .\nIn 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designated State Secrets Law to reduce these vulnerabilities and present Japan as a more valuable security partner .\nThe ensuing revamp of the intelligence services , under firmer central direction of a National Security Council , has reformed Japan \u2019 s capabilities to some extent .\nBut further complicating matters , New Zealand has now shown its hesitancy about using Five Eyes to pressure China .\nThis threatens to undermine the unity and stability of the alliance , even raising the prospect of New Zealand leaving Five Eyes altogether .\nJapan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main trading partner \u2014 could potentially be a stumbling block .\nThis relationship was managed fairly successfully under the Abe government , where the mutual benefits of trade and investment were prioritised .\nThis has largely continued under Suga , but more hawkish members of the government are starting to push a tougher line against China .\nWith the ongoing territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands , and more assertive demonstrations of force by the People \u2019 s Liberation Army , relations between China and Japan have become much frostier .\nAs Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , becoming a Five Eyes member has the potential to improve its strategic position via stronger support from its alliance partners .\nThe best prospect for Japan joining Five Eyes probably lies with cabinet minister Taro Kono .\nHe is the minister for administrative reform , responsible for supervising Japan \u2019 s COVID-19 vaccine rollout .\nIn his previous tenure as defence minister , Kono was enthusiastically in favour of Japan joining Five Eyes .\nThe energetic , media-savvy and ambitious Kono is widely favoured to replace Suga as prime minister if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in September .\nAn election for the lower house of the Diet ( Japan \u2019 s parliament ) also must be held by October .\nA more threatening security environment overall may hasten the push towards a \u201c Six Eyes \u201d anyway .\nA cyber attack on the Australian parliament in 2019 was implicitly blamed on China , while the US counterintelligence establishment is still reeling from the consequences of the massive Russian SolarWinds cyber attack and Moscow \u2019 s interference in the 2016 and 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tokyo Metropolitan Police have blamed the People \u2019 s Liberation Army for organising hundreds of cyber attacks on Japanese companies , universities and government departments , including Japan \u2019 s space agency JAXA .\nThis is certain to harden opinion against China .\nIf all members agree , especially with encouragement from the US , it would be fairly straightforward for Japan to

\u2019 s actually against Australia \u2019 s national interests to cancel its BRI deals .\nFor starters , they were agreed to by two internationally recognized governments , albeit Victoria \u2019 s being a state one and not federal .\nThis means that abruptly canceling them on a vague pretext harms Australia \u2019 s reputation by making it appear unreliable , especially since many suspect that it did so to please its American ally .\nSecondly , the federal government could have at least in theory attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really had a problem with them instead of just scrapping both of those pacts entirely .\nThis hints at its ulterior motives .\nIt \u2019 s understandable that some countries have complex relations between their state and central governments , especially those

\u201c national interests \u201d is being manipulated by some of their authorities and the latter \u2019 s foreign allies in America as part of the Hybrid War on BRI , which is a major component of the larger Hybrid War on China .\nIt \u2019 s a pity that their objective economic interests are being sacrificed as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will suffer are those same Australian people , many of

campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in South Korea , but also in overseas cities , to the acute embarrassment of Tokyo .\nBilateral disagreements over the wartime status of the Korean comfort women are most notably over who recruited them .\nTokyo \u2019 s position is that recruiters were third parties ; Koreans are of the belief that many were kidnapped by Japanese troops .\nContemporarily , Tokyo points to Seoul \u2019 s refusal to accept past apologies , deals and compensation packages .\nSouth Korea points to Japan \u2019 s lack of sincerity in accepting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of textbooks .\nIt also points to the actions of some right-wing politicians whose actions , such as visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , indicate a lack of contrition .\nThere are other complications

hatchets .\nTo Seoul \u2019 s discomfort , Washington is leaning toward Tokyo , with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga the first foreign leader to visit Biden last week .\nWashington has also voiced high-profile support for Japan \u2019 s Fukushima irradiated water release plan , which so irks Seoul that it is considering international legal action .\nPressed on these issues during a

Moon has recently done an apparent U-turn on comfort women .\nIn his new year \u2019 s speech this year , Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the January court decision \u2013 drawing howls of outrage from comfort

Moon has reached out to Suga in hopes of a reset .\nSuga , a long-time Abe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , has thus far refused Moon \u2019 s olive leaf .\nSo could Wednesday \u2019 s court decision been made

brazenly beating the war drums in the latest round of verbal aggression against China .\nThey have escalated the federal Coalition government \u2019 s anti-China propaganda to a dangerous new level .\nIn his ANZAC Day message , Pezzullo invoked Cold War speeches of United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former general Dwight D Eisenhower .\n\u201c On this ANZAC Day , in the 70th year of our principal military alliance , let us remember the warnings of two American generals who had known war waged totally , and brutally : we must search always for the chance for peace amidst the curse of war , until we are faced with the only prudent , if sorrowful , course \u2014 to send off , yet again , our warriors to fight the nation \u2019 s wars .\n\u201c Let there not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilisation \u2019 s soul .\nWho could begrudge the sorrow of Europeans after the horror of the First World War ?\nYet , in their sorrow and their revulsion at the thought of another terrible bloodbath , they did not heed the drums of war which beat through the 1930s \u2014 until too late they once again took up arms against Nazism and Fascism .\n\u201c Today , as free nations again hear the beating drums and watch worryingly the militarisation of issues that we had , until recent years , thought unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us continue to search unceasingly for the chance for peace while bracing again , yet again , for the curse of war .\n\u201c By our resolve and our strength , by our preparedness of arms , and by our statecraft , let us get about reducing the likelihood of war \u2014 but not at the cost of our precious liberty .\nWar might well be folly , but the greater folly is to wish away the curse by refusing to give it thought and attention , as if in so doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us perhaps.\n\u201d While Pezzullo did not name China in his overblown speech , the target of his war-drum beating was made explicit by Dutton .\nHe said that Australia was already under cyber attack and that a war with China over Taiwan can not be discounted .\nHe added that the armed forces were \u201c prepared for action \u201d and the leaked speech to special forces troops by then-special forces commander Major-General Adam Findlay from April 2020 appears to confirm this war footing .\nHe claimed that \u201c everyday Australians \u201d were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression because \u201c they know that what we are saying is factually based \u201d .\nThese two war drummer would have the public think that this is some heroic defence of democratic values in response to some recent challenge from China .\nHowever , the truth is that the US and Australia have been building up readiness for war against China for years .\nFrom the \u201c pivot to Asia \u201d under the Barack Obama administration , to the Force Posture Agreement , Australia has been complicit in a major military build-up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its navy to the Pacific ( an increase of 10 % ) , US marines were based in Darwin and US military aircraft were given access to Australian bases in the Northern Territory .\nBut there was also the development of a new aggressive military doctrine aimed at China , as former US army captain John Ford noted in a 2017 article in The Diplomat where he argued that the pivot was a provocation to China .\n\u201c Emblematic of this mistake was the roll-out of the Air-Sea Battle doctrine .\nFirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ASB became official doctrine in 2010 .\nFrom the beginning , it was an effort to develop an operational doctrine for a possible military confrontation with China and then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates openly discussed the need to counter China \u2019 s growing military capabilities .\n\u201c The signal received in Beijing was the United States had hostile intentions toward China and was trying to contain it militarily .\nThe result was that the entire pivot was seen by Beijing as part of a broader effort to encircle China.\n\u201d Essentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support under Coalition and Labor governments ) has been working to bolster its military encirclement of China and preserve its imperialist military dominance .\nAs part of the imperialist anti-China military build up , the federal government is on a $ 270 billion military spending spree which is great business for major arms manufacturers .\nInvestigative reports published by Michael West Media have exposed the rapacious padding and consistent blow-outs of military contracts .\n\u201c Australian governments and their defence leaders , with help from lobbyists , choose immensely complex , overpriced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of these articles .\n\u201c With the blow-out in the budget expected to hit nearly $ 1 trillion by 2023-24 as a result of the pandemic , one would think the Federal Government would crack down on wasteful spending .\nBut when it comes to defence spending , too much is never enough .\n\u201c Budget papers show defence funding will grow by a staggering 9.1 % in real terms to $ 42.7 billion this current financial year .\nBut much of the extra money will be wasted \u2014 yet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to build nine Hunter class frigates , which has gone from $ 30 billion in 2016 to $ 45.6 billion in 2020 .\n\u201c Then there \u2019 s the army \u2019 s new Infantry Fighting Vehicles , estimated to cost a \u2018 mind-boggling \u2019 $ 18\u201327 billion .\nThe mid-point estimate for the cost of each vehicle is $ 50 million .\n\u201c Then there \u2019 s the sustainment ( running ) costs for the Super Hornet and the Growler jets \u2014 a scandalous $ 100,000 per hour .\nThis compares to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hornets which still perform well .\n\u201c But taking the cake is the planned build of 12 ludicrously expensive Attack class submarines \u2013 a program that is a financial and capability disaster .\nThe cost has already gone from $ 50 billion in 2016 to $ 90 billion.\n\u201d Marcus Reubenstein on April 3 reported on the government \u2019 s announcement that it would spend a further billion dollars on acquiring new missiles .\nHe also noted that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute ( ASPI ) , which played a major role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , also had major sponsorship from the arms industry .\n\u201c Since ASPI \u2019 s inception it has received sponsorship from 12 manufacturers of weapons and weapons systems .\nOver that period , they have been awarded 9423 Defence Department contracts with a total value of $ 51.2 billion.\n\u201d Perhaps because of this relationship , ASPI \u201c estimates \u201d that Australia will spend $ 100 billion over the next 20 years buying missiles and guided weapons !\nThe US-Australia war alliance and the corrupt links between government and the arms industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrific imperialist war .\nIt will also incite more anti-Asian racism .\nRacism and a vote-buying budget are shaping up as core elements of Scott Morrison \u2019 s re-election bid .\nFor all these reasons ,

\u201c Today , the collective celebration of Christian , Muslim , and other non-Buddhist religious expression and participation in the movement itself hopefully foreshadows a more inclusive sense of

, the capital of Indonesia , a special meeting of the presidents and heads of government of ASEAN member countries was held to discuss the latest developments in Myanmar , which itself is a member of this Association , uniting 10 countries in the Southeast Asian region .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their concerns about the problems in their own countries some external problems , was the high-profile international consequences of the events that took place in Myanmar on February 1 this year .\nLet us briefly recap what this is about .\nToday \u2019 s Myanmar ( formerly the \u201c Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma \u201d ) , rich in a variety of natural resources and now occupying a very important strategic position , is a very complex country .\nIt is populated by about 100 ethnic and religious nationalities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the central government .\nArmed clashes are not a rare thing .\nIt is equally important to recall that since the second half of the last century , the inaccessible mountainous regions of Myanmar were one of the main elements of the so-called \u201c Golden Drug Corner , \u201d which supplied opiates to the world markets on a huge scale .\nCurrently , Myanmar \u2019 s Shan State ( the main area of separatist anti-government armed struggle ) is the leading supplier for methamphetamine markets .\nThe \u201c Drug Factor \u201d tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media in commentary on recent events in Myanmar .\nMeanwhile , its significance in the \u201c Great World Game \u201d as a whole ( at least of the last century and a half ) still seems grossly underestimated .\nIn particular , this is directly related to the Afghan issue .\nIn any case , it is the sum of these factors that explains why independent Myanmar has been led by the military up until the most recent period of its history .\nThis alone made it possible to preserve the integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations .\nBut the same circumstance has always been the main reason for the \u201c West \u2019 s \u201d ( very conditional ) negative assessments of the state system of Myanmar .\nThis negativity was particularly harsh after the Myanmar military , led by General Min Aung Hlaing , once again went \u201c behind the backs \u201d of the country \u2019 s civilian leadership .\nThe most frequently cited reason for the events of February 1 is the result of the general elections held in November 2020 .\nAs a result , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of seats in the country \u2019 s parliament .\nThis jeopardizes the legal basis ( still preserved in the current constitution ) for the military \u2019 s de facto control of the situation in Myanmar .\nIt is important to note the fact that Aung San Suu Kyi , who until relatively recently was one of the main icons of the global \u201c human rights \u201d movement , heads the NLD .\nThis latter has dramatically changed attitudes toward her since she became the de facto head of the civilian government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much different from Min Aung Hlai \u2019 s policies .\nBut after the military once again locked up Ms. Suu Kyi on February 1 ( apparently simply because they doubted her ability to keep the situation in the country under control ) , the patented \u201c human rights defenders \u201d like Amnesty International , as well as their real puppeteers , went \u201c off the rails \u201d .\nAlthough today , when Washington and Brussels ( the unelected officials of the latter for some reason position themselves as the \u201c voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about \u201c hundreds of peaceful protesters killed by the military junta , \u201d let us not lose sight of the very factor of simmering or quite active internal armed conflicts .\nFor example , in late April it was reported that armed Karen ( the third largest ethnic group in Myanmar ) seized an army base on the border with Thailand .\nBe that as it may , the prospect of another \u201c humanitarian intervention \u201d looms on the horizon .\nPotential participants could be a number of countries ( perhaps all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval exercises La Perouse in the Bay of Bengal , the entire eastern coast of which is composed of Myanmar .\nWhich , of course , would not go unanswered by the PRC .\nBut no one wants to see a new , extremely dangerous \u201c hot spot \u201d in the Indo-Pacific region , and the main players in the game here have recently been calling ( directly or covertly ) for ASEAN to intervene in the situation that is unfolding in Myanmar .\nIn particular , such a desire can be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the April 16 talks in Washington between Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan and US President Joe Biden .\nThe document refers to the \u201c central role of ASEAN \u201d in Southeast Asian affairs and , almost immediately thereafter , \u201c strongly condemns military and police violence against the citizens of Myanmar \u201d .\nNote , however , an important feature of ASEAN , which fundamentally distinguishes this association from the EU .\nUnlike the latter , whose officials unceremoniously interfere in the affairs of all countries of the Union ( and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASEAN has so far avoided interfering in the internal affairs of member countries .\nIn this regard , the initiative to hold a special summit of the Association on the situation in Myanmar , which was launched on March 19 by Indonesian President Joko Widodo , is unique .\nApparently , her main motive was to avoid the worst-case scenarios in the region involving the world \u2019 s leading powers .\nIt is worth noting the media fuss ( initiated by the same \u201c West \u201d ) on the eve of the discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format of the meeting and address to the incoming leader of the current military leadership of Myanmar , General Min Aung Hlaing .\nThere were proposals not to invite a delegation from this country at all , arranging a kind of \u201c visiting court \u201d over its leadership .\nBut as you can see from the photos at Jakarta airport , Min Aung Hlaing , who arrived for the summit , was treated quite traditionally , decently and , importantly , with the WHO recommended precautions necessary in these dangerous times of coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , without the presence of the press and apparently in the usual ASEAN \u201c family \u201d format .\nThat is , one member of the \u201c family \u201d ( who found himself in a predicament ) , in the person of the same General Min Aung Hlaing , was given both grievances and advice .\nAt the end of the meeting , only the president of Indonesia allowed himself to make some harsh remarks about the military leadership of Myanmar in public .\nWhich the addressee most likely did not hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn this connection , note that unlike today \u2019 s \u201c right-wing \u201d Pharisees , Asia has not lost what is commonly called conscience .\nHow can Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte condemn the Myanmar military when he himself has to resort to means that do not fit in any way the \u201c rules of etiquette \u201d of \u201c human rights activists \u201d in the fight against disastrous domestic problems ( especially in the drug trade ) .\nThe author would like to emphasize that Duterte received a mandate of trust of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 to use similar means ( previously tested by him when he was governor of a province of the country ) .\nIn this act of democracy ( without quotation marks ) he did not resort to the services of \u201c political technology \u201d crooks .\nWhich is the norm in countries of triumphant pharisaism .\nThe Jakarta summit resulted in a nine-point Statement , published on behalf of the ASEAN Secretariat .\nIt seems noteworthy that only the last two paragraphs are devoted to the main reason for the event .\nCommentators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demand in the Statement ( spelled out in a preliminary draft document ) for the current Myanmar leadership to immediately release all civilian political activists detained after the coup .\nThis means that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will continue observing events in the country she recently led , on TV at her home ( seating in a cozy armchair ) .\nApparently , General Min Aung Hlaing politely listened to all the friendly ( and not so friendly ) family advice and suggestions in Jakarta .\nBut he will likely continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the traditional question of \u201c what is good and what is bad \u201d for his country .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @

treacherous ground for war with China is being bedded down and readied .\nThe Yellow Peril image never truly dissipated from Australia \u2019 s politics .\nIt was crucial in framing the first act of the newly born Commonwealth in 1901 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China was being ravaged and savaged by foreign powers and implosion , there was a fear that somewhere along the line , a reckoning would come .\nCharles Henry Pearson , a professor of history at King \u2019 s College London , penned his National Life and Character : a Forecast ( 1893 ) with fear in mind .\nThe expansion of the West into all parts of the globe and its claims to progress would soon have to face a new reality : the threat posed by the \u201c Black and Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments .\nThe population of China was booming .\nThe Chinese diaspora , the same , making their presence felt in places such as Singapore .\n\u201c The day will come and perhaps is not far distant , when the European observer will look round to

the trade of their own regions , and circumscribing the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be \u201c elbowed and hustled , and perhaps even thrust aside by peoples whom we looked down upon as servile and thought of as bound always to minister to our needs.\n\u201d The work \u2019 s effect was such as to have a future US President Theodore Roosevelt claim in a letter to Pearson that \u201c all our men here in Washington \u2026 were greatly interested in what you said .\nIn fact , I don \u2019 t suppose that any book recently , unless it is Mahan \u2019 s \u2018 Influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much interest or has caused so many men to feel like they had to revise their mental estimates of facts \u201d .\nAnxiety , and sheer terror of China and the Chinese became part of the political furniture in Washington and in Britain \u2019 s dominions .\nIn Australia , such views were fastened and bolted in the capital .\nThe country \u2019 s first Prime Minister , Edmund Barton , drew upon Pearson \u2019 s work extensively in justifying the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901 .\nThe White Tribe had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian historian Donald Horne noted the continuing sense of impermanence for those living on the island continent , that \u201c feeling that one morning we shall wake up to find that we are no longer here \u201d .\nHe recalled the views of an unnamed friend about China \u2019 s political aspirations , voiced in 1954 .\nBy 1957 , he predicted , Southeast Asia would have fallen to its soldiers .\nAustralia would duly follow , becoming a dependency .\n\u201c Because of the submerged theme of impermanence and even catastrophe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201c the idea of possible Chinese dominance is \u2018 believable \u2019 to Australians \u201d .\nThere was a hiatus from such feeling through the 1980s and 1990s .\nThe view in Australia , as it was in the United States , was that China could be managed to forget history , disposing itself to making money and bringing its populace out of poverty .\nBut historical amnesia failed to take hold in Beijing .\nAustralian current actions in stoking the fires of discord over China serve a dual purpose .\nThere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies are always useful , even if they are mere apparitions .\nTherein lies the spirit of Barton , the besieged White tribe fearing submergence .\nThe other is to be found in the realm of foreign policy and military security .\nAustralian strategists have never been entirely sure how far the ANZUS Treaty could be relied upon .\nOne moment of candour on what might happen to trigger ANZUS obligations took place in 2004 .\nAustralia \u2019 s Foreign Minister Alexander Downer , on a trip to Beijing , pondered the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might affect US-Australian ties .\nAsked by journalist Hamish McDonald whether Australia had a treaty obligation to assist the US in defending Taiwan , the minister stated that the treaty was \u201c symbolic \u201d and would only be \u201c invoked in the event of one of our two countries , Australia or the United States , being attacked .\nSo some other military activity elsewhere in the world , be it in Iraq or anywhere else for that matter does not automatically invoke the ANZUS Treaty.\n\u201d Its provisions , he observed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States was attacked on September 11 , 2001 .\nThis startlingly sound reading did not go down well .\nThe press wondered if this cast doubt over \u201c ANZUS loyalties \u201d .\nThe US Ambassador to Canberra John Thomas Schieffer leapt into action to clarify that there was an expectation that Australia muck in should the US commit forces to battle in the Pacific .\n\u201c [ T ] reaty commitments are that we are to come to the aid of each other in the event of either of our territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our interests are attacked , our home territories are attacked or if either of our interests are attacked in the Pacific.\n\u201d One cable from the Australian government attempted to pacify any fears about Australia \u2019 s reliability by suggesting that , \u201c Some media reporting had taken elements [ of Downer \u2019 s comments ] out of context.\n\u201d The argument has now been

foolishly enough that it will commit troops and weapons to a folly-ridden venture over Taiwan , Washington will be duly impressed to dig deeper in the region to contain Beijing .\nThis betrays a naivety that comes with relying on strategic alliances with little reflection , forgetting that Washington will decide , in due course , what its own interests are .\nSo far , the Morrison government will be pleased with what the Biden administration has said .\nAustralia could be assured of US support in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken , \u201c the United States

providing the explosives and the latter knowledge of local conditions in the Myanmar heartland .\nIf that assessment is accurate and the hits were not isolated incidents , it could mean that Myanmar \u2019 s long-running , low-intensity civil wars are spreading from ethnic minority areas in the nation \u2019 s periphery to major cities and towns .\nThree months after top generals seized power from a popularly elected government and despite the fact that military and police have gunned down over 750 and arrested well over 4,000 protesters , people are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their anger with the coup .\nThe ongoing popular resistance underscores what is by now widely seen as perhaps the most unsuccessful coup in modern Asian history .\nThat could yet spell ill for coup leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing , who has stuck stubbornly to his guns amid rising international condemnation that is deeply isolating the country .\nThere are certain indications provided confidentially to Asia Times by military insiders that veterans of previous ruling juntas , namely the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) and State Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are growing wary of Min Aung Hlaing \u2019 s perceived as ineffective and polarizing actions and tactics .\nRecent developments , including the attacks on military airbases , have opened a Pandora \u2019 s box of possibilities and scenarios that were largely unforeseen when the tanks rolled into the main city of Yangon three months ago and scores of elected MPs and other politicians were arrested and detained in the capital Naypyitaw .\nThose include a wider civil war in the nation \u2019 s central region heartland , including near the generals \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 , unidentified militants fired rockets at air force bases in Magwe and Meiktila in central Myanmar .\nAnother explosion detonated at a Myanmar Army weapons storage facility near Bago city , about 70 kilometers north of Yangon .\nThose attacks came after intense fighting between the Myanmar military , known as Tatmadaw , and ethnic rebels from the Karen National Liberation Army ( KNLA ) on the border with Thailand .\nThe shadowy unclaimed attacks on airbases also coincided with intensified battles with the Kachin Independence Army ( KIA ) in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pro-democracy activists have sought refuge after bloody crackdowns in urban areas .\nThe Tatmadaw \u2019 s attacks have been marked by airstrikes on rebel targets which have included civilian villages .\nThat \u2019 s caused the recent displacement of more than 25,000 villagers in Kayin state and at least 5,000 in Kachin state .\nThat adds to the tens of thousands who fled their homes amid earlier fighting in the areas .\nLong-time observers of Myanmar \u2019 s politics have privately drawn parallels between current events and what happened after an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dissidents also took to the hills and jungles after the Tatmadaw crushed another nationwide , pro-democracy uprising .\nBut , they note , there are fundamental differences between the events of 1988 and current developments .\nIn 1988 , young urban dissidents formed the All Burma Students \u2019 Democratic Front ( ABSDF ) , donned uniforms and fought alongside ethnic rebels in the frontier areas .\nAt that time , it was much easier to acquire weapons from grey Thai arms markets and dissident groups had ready sanctuaries \u2014 and even offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved relations between the Thai and Myanmar militaries coupled with severe entry restrictions into Thailand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have at least so far kept the dissidents on the Myanmar side of the border .\nThe old ABSDF exists now only in name as most of its cadres have either surrendered or been resettled in third countries .\nThe ABSDF \u2019 s ultimately failed uprising could explain why the new ethnic-urban alliance has taken on a different and potentially more explosive form .\nIndeed , recent developments seem to signal the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tatmadaw is ill-equipped to handle .\nApart from the obvious alliances between informal groups of pro-democracy activists and ethnic rebels , local resistance forces have already emerged in Sagaing Region and Chin state .\nReports indicate similar forces are coalescing in Mon state and Mandalay Region .\nSocial media posts show those local partisans are equipped with hunting rifles and homemade explosives but have nonetheless been able to inflict significant casualties on the police and military , including in Kalay in Sagaing Region .\nIn nearby Chin state , a new force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 junta troops in their area .\nShadowy bomb and Molotov cocktail attacks have been reported against police stations in Yangon , Mandalay and Monywa .\nAt the same time , the Tatmadaw must contend with battle-hardened ethnic armies .\nIn the country \u2019 s far north , there have been over 50 clashes since Kachin rebels overran and captured a Tatmadaw outpost on the strategic Alawbum mountain near the Chinese border on March 25 .\nAirstrikes have failed to dislodge the KIA , which has carried out subsequent attacks near the Hpakant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Sumprabum in the state \u2019 s north .\nIn Kayin State , the Free Burma Rangers nongovernmental organization reports daily fights between the Tatmadaw and KNLA , despite the fact the two sides entered a ceasefire agreement in October 2015 .\nThat agreement , which included the Restoration Council of Shan State ( RCSS ) and eight smaller , rather insignificant groups , was termed a \u201c Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement \u201d ( NCA ) , although it was neither nationwide nor led to even a semblance of peace in frontier areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sided openly with Myanmar \u2019 s until now peaceful Civil Disobedience Movement , other ethnic groups have been less supportive .\nIn a March 27 interview with Reuters , RCSS chairman Yawd Serk said his group would not stand by idly if the junta \u2019 s forces continue to kill protesters but his vow hasn \u2019 t been followed up with any clear action .\nOn the contrary , the RCSS has been fighting a rival Shan group , the Shan State Army of the Shan State Progress Party and its ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Liberation Army ( TNLA ) for control of areas in northern Shan state .\nMyanmar \u2019 s most powerful ethnic army , the 20,000-30,000 strong United Wa State Army ( UWSA ) , has remained conspicuously silent since the coup .\nNot all Wa agree with the stance : Ten Wa civil society organizations signed on March 25 a written , urgent plea to the UWSA and its political wing the United Wa State Party to say something .\nThat hasn \u2019 t happened though , probably because the UWSA is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , which do not want to get involved with Myanmar \u2019 s anti-coup movement .\nProtesters have targeted Beijing \u2019 s perceived support of the regime at the United Nations .\nSeveral Chinese factories were torched in Yangon in one spasm of violence .\nThe 7,000-strong Arakan Army ( AA ) in Rakhine state , one of Myanmar \u2019 s most powerful rebel armies , which has killed hundreds of Tatmadaw soldiers in recent fighting , has taken a more surprising stance .\nIt entered into ceasefire talks with the Tatmadaw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its list of \u201c terrorist \u201d organizations soon after the February 1 coup .\nIts leader , Twan Mrat Naing , said on April 16 at the UWSA \u2019 s Panghsang headquarters that the ousted National League for Democracy government claimed that it would create a federal union with equal rights for all nationalities but failed to deliver on the promise .\nWith that view , it \u2019 s doubtful the AA will join any grand alliance between urban dissidents and ethnic armies .\nEven without a unified ethnic resistance , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s old guard could move to break the stalemate by pressuring or even trying to overthrow Min Aung Hlaing and his top deputies before the situation deteriorates further .\nThe SLORC and SPDC were likewise brutal outfits and no friends of democracy , but former junta chief and commander-in-chief Senior General Than Shwe did initiate liberal reforms that led to a more open society and vastly improved relations with the West and wider world before stepping aside in 2010 .\nThan Shwe is now in his late 80s and political analysts in Myanmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of legacy he would want to leave behind .\nWhether the aging general has the wherewithal , influence

By Gonzalez-Davidson \u2019 s calculations , members of his group have been arrested more than six times while carrying out their environmental activism , although he noted that most were released

this just makes the Hun Sen dictatorship even more unpopular and activates even more people into action , \u201d he added .\nPublic outrage as lakes continue to be lost The sentencing of young activists , particularly those as young as Kunthea and Keoraksmey , has prompted a public outcry in Cambodia and beyond , ranging from concern to downright anger .\nLocal human rights advocate @ @ @ @

concerns over the activists \u2019 wellbeing is prison are well-founded \u2013 Cambodia \u2019 s entire penal system holds some 40,000 inmates across facilities designed to hold just 26,593 and

stand trial .\nDespite warnings from rights groups and a COVID-19 scare in December 2020 , Cambodia \u2019 s prisons have faced criticism for doing little to address the public health risk posed by

before Cambodia \u2019 s failed war on drugs saw the prison population explode in 2016 , CC1 was believed to be operating at 165 % of occupant capacity , while CC2 held inmates at a rate of 259 % overcapacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Department of Prisons , declined to comment on how overpopulated CC1 or CC2 were currently , but while some new facilities have been built since 2016 and others expanded , the prison population has gone one way : Up .\nAs of March 2021 , LICADHO estimated that CC1 currently holds 7,466 inmates , operating at 364 % of the facility \u2019 s capacity of 2,050 .\nThings appear to be even worse at CC2 , which was designed to hold just 350 prisoners , but now houses 1,301 \u2013 371 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health measures .\nThe crisis brewing in Cambodia \u2019 s prison system , coupled with the charges against and subsequent conviction of the Mother Nature activists for inciting \u201c social chaos , \u201d has drawn harsh criticism from various international observers .\nHuman Rights Watch , Amnesty International \u2013 who recognize the jailed activists as prisoners of conscience \u2013 and Civicus all released independent statements lambasting Cambodia \u2019 s persecution of environmental activists .\n\u201c These environmental activists show incredible bravery by shining a light on corruption and rights abuses connected to crony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural resources and biodiversity , \u201d said Phil Robertson , deputy-director of Human Rights Watch \u2019 s Asia division .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s convictions are part of the Cambodian government \u2019 s continued vendetta against Mother Nature , a thorn in the government \u2019 s side that the officials are now moving to destroy through bogus criminal charges , \u201d he added .\nRobertson called on the UN , foreign governments and donors to demand the activists \u2019 freedom .\nShortly after , three UN special rapporteurs led by Mary Lawlor \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a joint statement condemning the court \u2019 s verdict and the lack of due process in the activists \u2019 trial .\n\u201c While the three human rights defenders may still file an appeal , I urge the Cambodian Government to immediately and unconditionally release them , \u201d Lawlor said .\n\u201c No one should be criminalized for undertaking legitimate human rights work.\n\u201d Ambassadors from the U.S.

by local and international rights defenders , it appears unlikely that Cambodia \u2019 s politically controlled judiciary will reverse its decision .\nSpokesperson for the Ministry of Justice Chin

through with a second session on May 11 at a gathering in Xi \u2019 an , China , hosted by Foreign Minister Wang Yi .\nThe venue is symbolic .\nThe ancient city of Xi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminus a quo \u2019 of the Silk Road .\nAnd , perhaps , the timing too , as this is also the 25th anniversary of the \u2018 Shanghai Five \u2019 process , where China , quietly but steadily , began building up its economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Central Asia and presented itself as viable partner .\nThe Xi \u2019 an meeting is a watershed event as it creates \u2018 institutional guarantee \u2019 for the nascent \u2018 C+C5 \u2019 framework .\nThe participants agreed on a memorandum of understanding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-quality construction of the Belt and Road and establish three research centres to carry out cooperation .\n\u2018 A journey of a thousand Chinese miles ( li ) starts beneath one \u2019 s feet , \u2019 the ancient Chinese proverb says .\nEven as the Shanghai Five process blossomed into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , C+C5 too appears to be destined to scale heights .\nThe Shanghai Five consisted of China , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Tajikistan , also had a modest beginning in 1996 as it emerged from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the four former Soviet republics held with China .\nThe institutionalisation of the C+C5 also marks a turning point in regional security \u2014 as the US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan gets under way amidst speculation that Pentagon is looking for basing facilities in Central Asian countries .\nInterestingly , the shadows of the great game have appeared too .\nThe Xi \u2019 an meeting comes within eighteen days of a similar meeting in \u2018 C5+1 \u2019 format with the participation of the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken ( in virtual mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for shamanic spirits and Buddhist gods .\nIt is unclear whether Blinken stole a march or vice versa .\nAn editorial in China Daily , the government newspaper , on Thursday flagged the high importance attached by Beijing to the C+C5 diplomatic initiative .\nIt noted that the C+C5 mechanism \u201c outlines an action plan that provides a stronger institutional guarantee for their cooperation.\n\u201d \u201c Transforming their shared will to pursue common development into concrete projects and actions , they have agreed to establish a C+C5 regional cooperation mechanism , promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road and establish three research centers to carry out cooperation in modern agriculture , archaeological and cultural heritage and traditional medicine.\n\u201d More importantly , the editorial said that the C+C5 meeting strengthened the \u201c strategic mutual trust , and agreed to make concerted efforts to build a China and Central Asia community with a shared future\u2026 ( and ) work together to promote regional security and stability and safeguard international justice.\n\u201d It highlighted a joint statement issued after the discussions as regards \u201c their joint efforts to promote peaceful reconciliation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will play a bigger role as a whole\u2026 That they have agreed to establish a regular meeting mechanism of the C+C5 foreign ministers indicates they are well aware of the importance of regional unity and coordination.\n\u201d Beijing \u2019 s motivations appear to be two-fold : send \u201c a clear signal that they ( C+C5 ) stand together in opposing interference in their internal affairs , and any actions threatening their core development interests \u201d ; and , emphatically state \u201c their common contention that Central Asia is neither a stage for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where any power can attempt to sow seeds of discord \u201d .\nForeign Minister Wang stressed that it is necessary for neighbouring countries of Afghanistan , including Uzbekistan and Tajikistan , \u201c to coordinate their positions in a timely manner , speak with one voice , and fully support the Afghan domestic peace process to overcome difficulties and move forward.\n\u201d Equally , a commentary in the Global Times has elaborated on Beijing \u2019 s concerns that the US pull out \u201c could leave chaotic situations and the region could become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d \u2014 terrorism , separatism and religious extremism .\nThe commentary cited expert opinion that aside Russia and China , the Central Asian countries will also be \u201c reluctant to host US military deployment on their soil \u201d , since increased US political and intelligence activities and involvement with local opposition parties , NGOs and media groups would only lead to colour revolution .\n\u201c In general , US troops are not very welcome in the region.\n\u201d Besides , the Chinese experts are also worried that the hasty US pullout may stall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war conditions , while the US allowed the region to become a \u2018 breeding ground \u2019 for the \u2018 Three Evils \u2019 and poppy cultivation \u2014 \u201c and now Washington wants to leave this mess to the regional countries.\n\u201d At the Xi \u2019 an meeting , Wang elaborated China \u2019 s position on the Afghan peace process as such .\nThe 3 key elements are : the need for inclusive political arrangements to make sure all ethnic groups and parties could participate ; drafting of a constitution that conforms to unique Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imitating western-style democracy ; and , \u201c moderate Muslim policy \u201d as state iedology .\nBeijing claims that its approach and Russia \u2019 s are complementary \u2014 \u201c Russia caring more about security , and China has the economic capability.\n\u201d Now , wouldn \u2019 t SCO have served the purpose ?\nOne reason could be that the SCO is no longer the same after the induction of India and Pakistan as members .\nConceivably , Russia , which is already focused on the upcoming summit with POTUS , remains chary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the onus on Beijing to do the heavy lifting .\nAn exclusive ope-ed in the CCP organ People \u2019 s Daily today is titled U.S. can \u2019 t just get away from it all in Afghan issues .\nIt concludes , \u201c At present , the US is the biggest exterior factor of the Afghan issues .\nThe White House shall not duck its responsibilities and get away from it all .\nIts withdrawal must be implemented in an orderly and responsible manner , and aim at preventing further escalation of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ramping up and creating trouble .\nIt shall create a favourable exterior environment for the Intra-Afghan Negotiations , not the other way around.\n\u201d Indeed , Moscow would consider it injudicious to be so outspoken at this juncture , knowing how ultra-sensitive Biden would be .\nIn fact , the US troops vacated the massive Kandahar airbase under cover of darkness in the night of May 11-12 without even informing Afghan officials .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above

experienced widespread human rights abuses by the Indonesian state and military .\nIn this article we argue that Australia has the responsibility and the expertise to do more to ensure that West Papuans \u2019 human rights are being upheld .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of West Papua , Australia , as a member of the United Nations , we contend , has a political duty to intervene under the United Nation \u2019 s \u2018 responsibility to protect \u2019 doctrine .\nSecond , we put forward that Australia also has a historic and moral obligation to the territory : West Papuans provided vital assistance to Australian troops in 1944 during World War 2 .\nIn the 1960s , however , Canberra betrayed its neighbour \u2019 s preparations for self-determination but we argue Australia now has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening in West Papua \u2019 s struggle against Indonesian oppression .\nThird , we argue that because Australia has set a precedent of intervention when it led the humanitarian intervention in East Timor in 1999-2000 , we know that intervention is possible and that the necessary political will can be mustered .\nWhereas Australia \u2019 s involvement in the East Timor crisis led to long term diplomatic tension between Australia and Indonesia , however , we propose that in this case , Australia \u2019 s contribution to addressing human rights in West Papua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries .\nIn August 2019 , a series of demonstrations of unprecedented size broke out across the large contested territory of West Papua.1 Initially protesting against racial violence and attacks on West Papuan university students in Java , Indonesia ( Barker September 2019a ) , the demonstrations escalated across West Papua in the wake of the global resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement following the 2020 racist killing of George Floyd in the USA by white police officers ( Yaung 2020 ) .\nThe ongoing protests brought attention to similar social injustices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indonesian security forces in West Papua .\nOver 50 people have now been killed by Indonesian security forces and Jihadi inspired militia since August 2019 ( Blades 2020 ) .\nAustralian civil society organisations have repeatedly requested that the Australian government seek to work with the government in Jakarta to put an end to human rights abuses in West Papua ( see , for example , Australia West Papua Association 2018a and 2019a ) .\nCanberra , however , has routinely and limply responded that it respects Indonesia \u2019 s sovereignty over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesian government officials that Jakarta is investigating all allegations of abuses ( see , for example , Australia West Papua Association 2018b and 2019b ) .\nThis article argues that Australia , West Papua \u2019 s closest southern neighbour , has the responsibility and the capacity to do more than it currently does to ensure that West Papuans \u2019 human rights are upheld .\nWorking in partnership with Indonesia \u2019 s Komisi Nasional Hak Asasi Manusia ( National Commission on Human Rights ) may be the best means of progressing a collaborative investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article .\nFirst , the article illustrates the gravity of the conflict in West Papua .\nAs a member of the United Nations ( UN ) , Australia has a political duty to intervene under the UN \u2019 s \u2018 responsibility to protect \u2019 ( R2P ) doctrine .\nSecond , Australia also has a historic and moral obligation to West Papuans since they provided critical assistance to Australian forces during World War 2 when in 1944 the troops landed in what is now West Papua \u2019 s largest city , Jayapura ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Government subsequently betrayed West Papuans \u2019 advanced preparations for self-determination ( which , together with the Dutch government , it had previously backed ) by supporting the 1962 New York Agreement in which the Netherlands was forced to hand over control of West Papua not to Papuans , but to Indonesia ( see Saltford 2003 , 14 ) .\nIntervening now would give Australia a chance to finally make reparations for its past neglect of its moral obligations to the Papuan people .\nThird , we argue that Australia has set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention in East Timor in 1999-2000 prior to the arrival of UN peacekeepers .\nBecause of this , we know that the Australian government can summon the political will when under ample pressure from civil society and in a sufficiently dire situation .\nWhereas Australia \u2019 s military involvement in the East Timor crisis led to long term diplomatic tension between Australia and Indonesia , however , we propose that Australia \u2019 s contribution to addressing human rights in West Papua could ultimately strengthen ties between the two countries .\nThere is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been committed by Indonesian military forces and their militias against West Papuans .\nCrimes against humanity , under the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , include murder , torture , forced transfer of populations , and acts that intentionally cause great suffering knowingly committed against civilians of a population ( International Criminal Court 1998 ) .\nSince invading West Papua in 1962 , Indonesia \u2019 s occupation of the territory has been marked by acts of brutality that fall clearly within the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations n.d. ) .\nReports by leading analysts of the West Papua conflict have documented decades of instances of rape , torture , summary

Chipping Away \u2019 ) was executed in the Central Highlands of West Papua in 1977 and 1978 .\nIndonesia never produced an official death toll for the operation but the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated the number of deaths to be 3,000 ( Tebay 2004 , 5 ) .\nThose who lived through the operation counted 4,146 deaths and reported being subject to strafing from AK47 rifles and napalm bombs , anti-personnel cluster bombs , and mortar bombs ( Asian Human Rights Commission 2013 , 10 and 24 , see Figure 1 above ) .\nThe use of napalm against civilians is banned in the United Nations

Osborne 1985 , 88 ) .\nIn 1996 , following the kidnapping by the West Papuan nationalist army ( the TPN-PB ) of a group of European zoology students in the highlands village of Gesemlema , a Red Cross helicopter bearing the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military personnel shot dead 16 West Papuans at close range ( see Figure 1 above ) .\nThe Papuans had gathered to greet the helicopter which they had

Papuans who were peacefully protesting for independence around the water tower in Biak City on the island of Biak .\nVictims were taken out to sea on naval vessels and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several weeks afterward .\nHundreds of people were injured , tortured and sexually mutilated ( ELSHAM 2013 ) .\nSince December 2018 , Indonesian security forces have been carrying out a counterinsurgency

other measures to protect populations in other states when those states are unable or unwilling to do so themselves .\nIt would hold then that under the R2P doctrine , Australia has a responsibility to prevent the ongoing crimes against humanity that are taking place in West Papua .\nHelping West Papuans now is an opportunity to pay historical reparations Not only does Australia have an obligation to West Papuans under the R2P doctrine , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay reparations to and make up for its historical betrayal of West Papua .\nThe territory has a complicated colonial past , subject to the capricious agendas of the world powers with vested interests in the region .\nThe old European colonial regimes that had once controlled people and commerce across much of Asia and the Pacific were overthrown and largely ( albeit briefly ) replaced in the Japanese Empire during World War Two .\nWhen Australian troops joined US and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army troops on April 22 , 1944 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Jayapura , they were aided by West Papuans who provided them with accommodation , guidance through the jungles , and hospital care ( Fox 2017 ) .\nEven earlier on , West Papuans contributed to intelligence gathering for the Allied forces , spying on and sabotaging Japanese operations in their territory\u2014although their efforts were not always appreciated by those engaging their assistance .\nFor example , the Australian anthropologist Donald Thomson , sent by the First Australian Army to Dutch New Guinea to carry out a reconnaissance mission , described a crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rough terrain possible as knowing \u201c nothing of discipline , nothing of hygiene , and less of navigation \u201d ( 1953 , 8 ) .\nThat same expedition \u2019 s cook was hardly more complimentary , calling the food offered by locals to supplement the Australian crew \u2019 s rations \u201c bloody Boong \u2019 s tucker \u201d ( Thomson 1953 , 8 ) .\nOther Australians fighting in West Papua during World War Two have fonder memories of the assistance provided by West Papuans .\nSergeant James Burrowes remembers the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buka , Mariba\u2014in the Allied Intelligence Bureau known as the \u2018 Coastwatchers \u2019 ( 2016 ) .\nMas and Buka were killed in a Japanese ambush .\n\u201c \u2018 Without the Coastwatchers \u2019 \u201d , Burrowes recalls the Commander of the US 7th Fleet , Admiral Halsey , declaring , \u201c \u2018 the Pacific War would not have been won \u2019 \u201d ( 2016 ) .\nSimilarly , a photograph in the Australian War Memorial archives shows a Lance Corporal of the Field Security Section ( FSS ) of the Australian Intelligence Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canoe with his West Papuan ( Marind Anim ) interpreters ( see Figure 3 below ) .\nThe FSS relied on local people for intelligence about Japanese movements ( Australian War Memorial 1944 ) .\nFigure 3 Eilanden River , Dutch New Guinea , November 1944 .\nLance Corporal Errol Smith stands with his Marind Anim interpreters Sarah , Susie and Pedrovitj .\nPhoto : Australian War Memorial National Gallery In arguing that Australia is indebted to West Papuans , we are not suggesting that West Papuans were acting out of na\u00efve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be ongoingly grateful .\nThe reality was and is more complex than that .\nIt was often coercion , not loyalty , which prompted indigenous assistance to Allied forces .\nRather than gratitude , Australians owe West Papuans something more akin to reparations .\nCertainly , on the eastern side of New Guinea , present day Papua New Guinea , it was recognised by local elders that local war labourers were not so much recruited as \u201c taken \u201d by Allied forces to enable their war efforts ( Winter 2020 , 355 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disloyal by the Allies , the consequences were dire .\nTen New Guineans were hanged by Australian authorities for treason ( Banivanua Mar 2016 , 120 ) .\nCollaboration between locals on both sides of the island and the Allied troops can not be disentangled from colonial power in the region .\nOf course , not all instances of local support for Australian troops in New Guinea emerged from coercion or even a sense of obligation to colonial \u2018 masters \u2019 .\nMany cross-cultural bonds of a personal nature , characterised by respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c relational loyalties were forged on a local level , beyond national loyalties or the binaries of \u2018 friend and foe \u2019 \u201d ( Winter 2020 343 ) .\nNonetheless , Papuans on both sides of the island suffered and made sacrifices on their own land to help defend Australia from Imperial Japan\u2014whole villages were bombed and/or relocated , crops and livestock were commandeered by Allied troops , labour recruitment led to disrupted gardening and starvation , and education was delayed ( Winter 2020 , 357 ) .\nThese sacrifices and sufferings during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan \u2019 s southward advance .\nAustralia now has a chance to repay West Papuans in kind by standing up for West Papuans \u2019 human rights in their time of great need .\nThe Japanese military regime was driven out of Melanesia in 1945 .\nAfter World War Two the United Kingdom , Portugal and the Netherlands realised that their colonial structures were no longer viable ( Cribb 2010 , 68 ) and generally not supported by the new global superpower , the USA .\nIn 1949 , when Indonesia gained its independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Papua to be included as part of its new state , ostensibly relying on the international legal principle of uti possidetis juris in which the territorial boundaries of a decolonised state are formed to match the boundaries of the former colony .\nHowever , although the territories of Indonesia and West Papua were both subject to Dutch colonisation , they were administered separately , in effect rendering the principle of uti possidetis juris irrelevant in this case .\nAnd the Dutch , hoping to maintain at least some influence in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not intend to hand West Papua over to Indonesia .\nThe Dutch administration began to prepare West Papua for independent nation statehood .\nBy 1961 , the transition to self-governance was well underway and unifying national symbols including a flag , a national anthem and a name for their state\u2014West Papua \u2013 had been established .\nIn response , Indonesia commenced military incursions into West Papua .\nFearing that Jakarta would turn to Communist countries for support in its quest to wrest West Papua from the Dutch , the US Kennedy administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands , in which West Papua was initially administered as a United Nations trust territory and then later placed under Indonesian administration .\nWest Papuans were not consulted about this sudden change .\nThe Agreement stipulated that by 1969 an act of self-determination would be held for West Papuans in which they would be given a chance to vote for independence or official integration with Indonesia .\nIt did not , however , dictate how that vote should be carried out .\nUp until 1962 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for an independent West Papua , concerned that if Indonesia acquired West Papua , it might then seek control of the eastern half of the island , the Territory of Papua and New Guinea , which was under Australian administration ( Saltford 2003 , 7 , 13-14 ) .\nWith Indonesian military incursions into West Papua increasing , Washington refused to back the Dutch militarily in the event of armed clashes with Indonesia over West Papua .\nAs a result , the Dutch relinquished their claim for West Papuans of self-determination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13-14 ) .\nIn fact , the latter had so changed its strategic and diplomatic direction that by January 1962 , Canberra was \u201c giving active encouragement to the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia \u201d ( Jenkins 1993 , 4 ) .\nAustralia \u2019 s about-face on independence was a serious blow to West Papuan hopes , and was felt even more deeply in 1969 , immediately before the staging of the act of self-determination set out in the New York Agreement ( Rollo 2013 ) .\nTwo West Papuan activists , Clemens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence and injustices under which preparations for the referendum were taking place , had crossed the border from West Papua into the Australian-administered territory of Papua and New Guinea .\nThey were on their way to the United Nations to deliver testimonies from West Papuan leaders and to warn the world that the plebiscite was going to be a farce .\nIn preparing for the so-called Act of Free Choice ( still known locally as the Act of No Choice ) , Indonesia handpicked a select number of West Papuans who comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom they coerced , with threats of violence , to choose integration with Indonesia .\nAustralian officials intercepted Runawery and Zonggenau and detained them on Manus Island , refusing to let them deliver their message to the world ( Runawery 2009 ) .\nAlthough UN staff on the ground knew of the deeply flawed process of the vote ( United States Embassy 1969 ) , in the context of the Cold War , and hoping to counteract Indonesia \u2019 s communist leanings , the international community acquiesced to West Papua \u2019 s annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial states in the Pacific have achieved their independence through peaceful means ( for example , Papua New Guinea from Australia in 1975 , and Solomon Islands from Britain in 1978 ) , the only state to break free from Indonesia\u2014East Timor\u2014did so through violent and bloody conflict and , ultimately , UN support , in 1999 .\nThe nature of decolonisation today would still seem to be largely dependent on the political and economic priorities of western governments , as it was in the 1960s for West Papua .\nAs such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua by Australia since World War Two , it should be a political priority for the Australian government to work with Indonesia towards ending atrocities in the territory .\nAustralia has the capacity to make a difference in West Papua Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard ( 1996-2007 ) stated that contributing to the independence of East Timor was one of his key achievements on the international stage ( Barker 2019b ) .2 Where early Australian intervention was critical in East Timor was at the very local level where Australian Federal Police ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor ( UNAMET ) , were placed to assist with the conduct of the independence referendum .\nThese Australian officers disobeyed requests by their superiors to abandon a compound where some 3,000 East Timorese had taken shelter from the murderous rampage of Indonesian-backed militia ( Martinkus 2015 ) .\nAmanda Vanstone , a former Howard-government senator , stated : \u201c AFP officers were amongst the first international contingents into East Timor , having served there since July 1999 , when they played a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination ballot .\n\u2026 It was in fact , only the unarmed civilian police , mostly Australian and led by an Australian , who refused to give up when others were ready to leave East Timor .\nThey stood between armed militia and the defenceless people of East Timor .\nWithout that group and their willingness , or determination , to hold on in a desperate and dangerous situation , the United Nations may have in fact withdrawn \u201d ( Hansard 2000 ) .\nJohn Martinkus , an Australian journalist present in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of Australian police and their refusal to abandon the East Timorese that a Srebrenica-style massacre was avoided ( Martinkus 2015 ) .\nOn 20 September 1999 Australia led the International Force East Timor ( INTERFET ) under the command of Major-General Peter Cosgrove , into East Timor .\nThe force was able , by February 2000 , to gain control over land and sea points of entry into East Timor .\nIt gained control of the security situation within East Timor , helped transition East Timor from INTERFET control to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Timor ( UNTAET ) , and redeployed INTERFET troops to UNTEAT or to home locations ( Nautilus Institute n.d. ) .\nAustralia did not achieve all of this alone , of course .\nAssistance from New Zealand , the UK , Thailand , the Philippines and the US , among other countries , was critical .\nNevertheless , Australia \u2019 s logistical expertise , geographical location ( considerable military infrastructure and support necessarily came from Darwin ) ( Gosling 2019 ) , familiarity with Indonesian military capabilities and relationships with Indonesian key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital to the success of the peace enforcing mission .\nAccording to East Timor expert John Blaxland , \u201c In essence , the 1999 East Timor intervention led to a shift in perceptions of how Australia should see itself and what it could and should do to act decisively in its neighbourhood \u201d ( 2015 ) .\nWhat would it take for Australia , perhaps in partnership with other countries , to apply the same policies that it employed so effectively in East Timor to the crisis in West Papua ?\nAustralia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are hesitant to intervene in human rights crises in their region , particularly when Indonesia is involved .\nIn 2006 Australia signed the Lombok Treaty assuring Indonesia it would respect the sovereignty of the Indonesian state .\nA policy of appeasement for Indonesia appears to be the norm , regardless of the political persuasion of the Australian government of the day , and even the current progressive New Zealand prime minister , Jacinda Ardern , has avoided discussion on the topic ( Leadbeater 2019 ) .\nMedia played a critical role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Australia and their counterparts to intervene in the East Timor conflict , and it appears the Indonesian security forces gained significant operational intelligence from this experience .\nIn recent years a complete media ban , denial of requests from the UN Human Rights Commission to investigate atrocities and human rights violations , and the cutting of internet services over the past year , have played a key role in suppressing information and media that may raise support for the independence movement in West Papua .\nSocial media , however , continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of torture as well as attacks on protestors .\nFor example , a video circulated on Twitter in February 2020 showed the Indonesian police interrogating a terrified young West Papuan male by wrapping a large snake around him ( Davidson 2019 ) .\nOther civilian videos show protesters being shot at by security forces ( The Guardian 2019 ) .\nRecent media accounts suggest that Jihadis were also recruited to supress the recent West Papuan protests ( Kingsbury 2019 ) .\nAnd it has been reported that the Indonesian government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dilute Pacific Island states \u2019 ( FSM , Nauru , Tuvalu , Solomon Islands and Fiji ) opposition to Indonesian human rights violations and support for West Papuan independence ( Wyeth 2018 ) .\nWe know from the East Timor crisis that a major reason why Australia \u2019 s reluctant politicians finally agreed to the humanitarian intervention was due to pressure from the Australian public ( Fernandes n.d. ) .\nIs it possible that social media from West Papua , as well as mainstream media accounts of abuses within Papua ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually lead to a similar torrent of public outrage that would pressure the Australian government to act ?\nWe have seen from East Timor that Australia can take effective action to bring an end to human rights abuses .\nWhat is required is the political will\u2014something civil society can help to build .\nAustralia also needs to reflect on the best way to become involved .\nINTERFET cast a long shadow on relations between Indonesia and Australia .\nIndonesia considered Australia \u2019 s role in the intervention to be perfidy , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s \u201c traditional accommodationalist policy towards Jakarta \u201d ( Chalk 2001 , 233 ) .\nBecause of this perceived betrayal , Indonesia is wary of \u201c the oft-repeated statements of Australia \u2019 s recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in Papua , as written in the Lombok Treaty \u201d , which \u201c are not taken at face value in Jakarta .\nThe unspoken response is that this was what Australia said about Timor Leste , until it mattered \u201d ( Chauvel 2019 ) .\nTo avoid further aggravating Australia \u2019 s relationship with Indonesia\u2014one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healed\u2014any Australian move with regard to West Papua would need to affirm Australia \u2019 s trust in Indonesians \u2019 good will toward West Papuans , be collaborative at the grassroots as well as diplomatic levels , and offer a win to both Jakarta and West Papuans .\nThe remainder of this article discusses one proposal for such an approach .\nCould Australia partner with Indonesia to improve human rights in West Papua ?\nAustralian collaboration with Indonesian actors and institutions toward improved human rights in West Papua could operate at three levels .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia could partner with civil society supporters of West Papuan rights in Indonesia to put pressure on the Indonesian government .\nEncouragingly , solidarity for West Papua from within Indonesia is growing rapidly at present , possibly due to Indonesia \u2019 s heightened awareness of racism in the context of the global Black Lives Matter movement ( Koman and Kareni 2020 ) .\nProminent Indonesian activists for West Papua currently residing in Australia include , for example , Veronica Koman , a human rights lawyer who has given pro bono legal assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 in Indonesia and who is a member of the Jayapura-based Human Rights Lawyers Association for Papua ( see Octavianti 2020 ) .\nAnother is Hipolitus Wangge , an Indonesian academic undertaking a PhD in Australia , who spent three months in the West Papuan highlands regency of Nduga volunteering to help internally displaced persons fleeing an Indonesian military counterinsurgency ( Wangge and Webb-Gannon 2020 ) .\nThere are also Indonesians who have a long history of supporting human rights in West Papua .\nMuridan Widjojo was an Indonesian scholar who , prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated for peace in West Papua and hoped to broker dialogue between West Papuan and Indonesian government representatives .\nAndreas Harsono is an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch based in Indonesia who monitors human rights violations in West Papua and advocates for justice .\nBudi Hernawan is an Indonesian academic and former Franciscan brother who worked for a church-based human rights organisation in West Papua for more than a decade .\nThese are only a few of the many Indonesians working to stem human rights abuses in West Papua .\nPro-democracy advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for UN sanctioned human rights investigations into the crisis on Australia \u2019 s doorstep ( Verroya 2020 ) .\nIndonesia is not a member of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , the only international body that can undertake investigations into crimes against humanity and genocide within its member countries .\nIndonesia does , however , hold a seat on the Human Rights Council .\nIf the UN Security Council is convinced that human rights abuses or genocidal acts are being conducted by a state , the Security Council can refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter institution to undertake an investigation .\nAt a minimum , the UN needs to undertake an independent investigation of other alleged human rights abuses , and now that Indonesia has a seat on the UN Human Rights Council , it should fully support such an investigation .\nThe military still has much political influence in Indonesia , and bringing to account commanders who have committed human rights abuses seems to be politically difficult within the Indonesian legal system\u2014with UN assistance , however , this may be feasible.3 Australians standing in solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesians doing the same to amplify calls for a UN investigation into human rights abuses in West Papua .\nCollaboration through webinars on important human rights issues in West Papua is another way Australian , Indonesian and West Papuan civil society members are working together to advocate for West Papuan rights .\nFor example , in August 2020 , Hipolitus Wangge appeared on a webinar with Australian and West Papuan activists that discussed why the proposed extension of Jakarta \u2019 s Special Autonomy law in West Papua would be a violation of Papuans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project and International Academics for West Papua 2020 ) receiving 1,257 views on YouTube .\nAt the state diplomacy level , Australia would need to persuade Jakarta that a collaboration with Australia to this end would benefit Indonesia .\nIndonesia has been internationally condemned over its handling of human rights abuses in West Papua .\nEighty-four countries have called for the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner to be allowed into West Papua to conduct a fact finding mission ( ULMWP 2021 ) to investigate human rights abuses .\nIndonesia might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic power\u2014Australia\u2014toward improving human rights in West Papua would relieve , in the short term , some of the international pressure on Jakarta .\nThe Australian government could encourage the Indonesian government to provide more support to Komnas HAM , Indonesia \u2019 s national human rights commission , to investigate security forces \u2019 breaches of human rights in West Papua .\nKomnas HAM has reported being under-resourced ( Iswinarno and Suri 2020 ) and its findings in a major human rights investigation in Paniai , West Papua , have been dismissed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nBy urging Indonesia to strengthen its own internal human rights monitoring mechanisms , Australia could avoid the appearance of interfering with Indonesian sovereignty over West Papua .\nBuilding on the second level , a third , or technical , level of collaboration may also be possible .\nAustralia could offer the assistance of its experts with experience in the prosecution of war criminals .\nThis could occur in tandem with a UN investigation .\nFor example , after the Bosnian massacres , grave site excavations led by Australian forensic archaeologist Emeritus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation supported by an Australian Federal Agent at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( the ICTY ) , provided clear evidence of crimes relating to genocidal acts by senior Yugoslav military officers against Islamic Serbs .\nThis resulted in the successful prosecution of a number of war criminals .\nAlternatively , if Indonesia is opposed to a UN investigation into human rights in West Papua , Australian forensic scientists and human rights experts could work bilaterally with Indonesia \u2019 s human rights commission , Komnas HAM , to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia would need to be willing to bring the evidence to trial and prosecute , however , for such an approach to end impunity for rogue elements of the Indonesian military .\nThis would obviously benefit West Papuans , but would also benefit Indonesia by building the professional capacity of Komnas HAM .\nIndividual Australians have had the courage to stand up to crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Indonesian military and militias in the past .\nAustralian Federal Police officers caught children being thrown over the razor wire fence at the Dili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save their children from the rampaging Indonesian militia .\nAustralian soldiers were parachuted in to secure the Dili wharf , surrounded by heavily armed Indonesian military and militia , and anxiously awaited the main relief fleet from Darwin to arrive and help put an end to the bloodshed .\nInvestigators and forensic archaeologists excavated the mass graves of Srebrenica under threat of Bosnian snipers .\nIn each of these examples , Australians have demonstrated they have the moral fibre to help neighbours and those further afield in need .\nWest Papuans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also in need .\nAustralia needs to step up once again to show regional leadership in protecting human rights .\nWe have argued in this article that there are three reasons why Australia is obliged to do so .\nAs a signatory to the United Nations \u2018 responsibility to protect \u2019 doctrine , Australia is required to intervene when other states are unable or unwilling to prevent atrocities within their borders .\nWe presented our \u2018 massacre map \u2019 of West Papua , and cited evidence that crimes against humanity are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua .\nBased on the evidence presented in this paper , Australia has a responsibility to prevent these crimes from continuing .\nAustralia also has a responsibility to help West Papua as a debt of gratitude stretching back to World War Two , and also as an apology for turning a blind eye to Indonesia \u2019 s rigging of the 1969 so-called Act of Free Choice .\nThird , Australia should help West Papua because it canhelp West Papua\u2014it has the resources and expertise to do so .\nWe proposed that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indonesia to put an end to atrocity crimes in West Papua .\nFirst , concerned sectors of civil society in Australia and Indonesia could collaborate to raise awareness of human rights violations in West Papua and to call for a UN investigation into those violations .\nIn many ways this has already been occurring .\nSecond , Australia could work with Indonesia at a diplomatic level to convince Indonesia to strengthen its own internal human rights watchdog , Komnas HAM .\nThird , Australian experts with technical skills in investigating war crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capacity building partnership with Komnas HAM to collect evidence of abuses in West Papua , if Indonesia would agree to cooperate and prosecute .\nThe key to the success of any or all of these approaches is collaboration .\nIndonesia is extremely sensitive to challenges to its sovereignty .\nTo avoid further diplomatic breakdown of relations between Canberra and Jakarta , Australian efforts to stop human rights abuses in West Papua should , in the first instance , include attempts to partner with Indonesia .\nThis article has argued a normative case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal investigation into abuses in West Papua , either by the UN or by a better resourced Komnas HAM .\nAustralia has the technical capacity to facilitate such an investigation .\nWhat remains in question is whether the Australian government has the courage and political will to become involved .\nSignificant pressure from civil society can overturn government reluctance to act .\nIt is our hope , as a collective of concerned Australian forensic archaeology and human rights specialists , that as evidence of atrocities mount up , Canberra will finally decide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to readers :

having passed with little damage by the first wave of COVID-19 , began to suffer strongly between the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 , with the second wave being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant of the virus , much more lethal than the first one .\nThe country records 26 million cases of contamination , with 300 thousand deaths and an average of daily deaths of almost 4 thousand people .\nIn addition to the coronavirus , India is suffering from the outbreak of a lethal fungus , popularly known as \u201c black fungus \u201d , which causes the mucormycosis disease .\nThis disease already existed in India before the pandemic , but was considered rare , having reached an extraordinary increase with the new variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fungi of the genus Mucor , commonly found in soil , in the air and even in the nose and human mucus , the disease spreads through the respiratory tract and corrodes facial structures .\nAssociated with coronavirus , mucormycosis has much more serious effects and considerably increases chances of death .\nSometimes , doctors need to surgically remove the eye to prevent the infection from reaching the brain of a patient .\nThe inadequate sanitary conditions in the treatment centers allow the exposure to the fungus , which has already resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indian scenario is catastrophic .\nLack of oxygen in hospitals , crowded crematoriums , lack of ambulances and people dying on the streets have become commonplace in Indian daily life .\nIn addition to the terrifying official figures , there is still a strong concern about underreporting , due to the difficulty of the Indian state in controlling some of the country \u2019 s most isolated regions .\nThe economic and social consequences make the situation even worse .\nAbout 230 million Indians have fallen into poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most affected .\nThe confinement implemented for months in India has left around 100 million people unemployed , according to a report by Azim Premji University published in early May .\nAbout 47 % of those affected by unemployment are women , which also hinders the slow process of social inclusion of women and gender equality in the country .\nInterestingly , there is a contradictory point in the Indian crisis : the country is the world \u2019 s largest manufacturer of vaccines \u2013 and even so , it continues to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main vaccine producers on Indian soil , the Serum Institute , in the city of Pune , which is producing the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ; and Bharat Biotech , in Hyderabad , which is producing its own vaccine .\nThe Indian government authorized companies to start producing doses last year and the country quickly became the largest global producer .\nLarge-scale production was part of a strategy by the Indian government to combat the pandemic \u2013 it was believed that , with more production , greater the national stock of doses .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil were destined for export and with the worsening of the internal crisis , manufacturing decreased considerably due to the lack of resources , making the national stock insufficient to contain the infection cycle .\nThe shortage of vaccines , however , was only realized after the government initiated a comprehensive mass vaccination plan in early May .\nOnly 41 million people were fully vaccinated , while 104 million received the first dose .\nIn many countries , this number would be significant , but in a nation with 1.4 billion inhabitants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the crisis , the government has banned the export of vaccines .\nThe objective is to preserve all the resources available to vaccinate the Indian population , but this will result in a great loss for several countries that depend on Indian vaccines \u2013 some of these countries have already paid in advance for millions of doses that will be sent only at the end of 2021 , when the Indian government hopes to resume export .\nThe crisis reveals serious strategic mistakes by the government .\nThe first mistake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave .\nDue to the low number of cases \u2013 compared to the rest of the world \u2013 the Indian government has failed to supervise sanitary policies .\nAgglomerations were part of Indian daily life throughout the year 2020 , without any measures being taken to maintain health care .\nA second mistake was the national vaccine production plan .\nIn fact , the most correct thing to do would be to focus on internal supply and establish as a contractual condition with pharmaceutical companies for production the reservation of a considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months there would be enough stock to vaccinate the population .\nIt is also necessary to emphasize how the absence of economic strategy has harmed India , leaving millions of people into poverty and unemployment without any social support .\nLacking assistance , people can not remain isolated in their homes \u2013 the tendency is for them to leave more and more , in search of work or other means of obtaining resources .\nThis creates a vicious cycle of simultaneous increase in poverty and infection .\nDespite still producing many vaccines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion people and no resources to continue large-scale manufacture , which means that New Delhi will begin to import large quantities of doses .\nThe situation is truly worrying in India and the country is unlikely to recover without strong international cooperation \u2013 both for sending vaccines and for economic aid .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site ,

Covid-19 crisis , its performance has been far worse on the vaccine front .\nThe government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi , which seems to believe in the ideology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market will magically produce the number of vaccines the country needs .\nThis would explain why it has starved seven public-sector vaccine manufacturing units \u2013 according to an April 17 article in Down to Earth \u2013 of any support instead of ramping up much-needed vaccine production .\nThe rights to produce the public-sector vaccine Covaxin , which has been developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) and National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) , in collaboration with Bharat Biotech , have been given to the private-company partner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the Serum Institute of India , another private-sector company and the world \u2019 s largest vaccine manufacturer , which has tied up with AstraZeneca to produce Covishield , would make vaccines according to the country \u2019 s requirements without any prior orders or capital support .\nThe government did not even see the necessity to intervene and prevent India \u2019 s new Quad ally , the US , from stopping sending India supplies of the raw materials needed by India for manufacturing vaccines .\nThe sheer negligence by the government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though India has about 20 licensed manufacturing facilities for vaccines and 30 biologic manufacturers , all of which could have been harnessed for vaccine manufacturing , only two companies are currently producing vaccines .\nThat too is at a pace completely inadequate for India \u2019 s needs .\nIndia has a long history of vaccine development , which can be traced back to the Haffkine Institute for Training , Research and Testing , in Mumbai , in the 1920s .\nWith the Patents Act of 1970 and the reverse engineering of drugs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CSIR ) laboratories , the country also broke the monopoly of global multinationals .\nIt is this change , fought for by the left , that led to India emerging as the largest generic supplier of drugs and vaccines in the world and becoming the global pharmacy of the poor .\nBill Gates recently spoke to Sky News in the UK regarding India \u2019 s and South Africa \u2019 s proposal to the World Trade Organization on the need to lift intellectual property protection for Covid-19 vaccines and medicines during the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue and that \u201c moving a vaccine \u2026 into a factory in India \u2026 it \u2019 s only because of our grants and our expertise that can happen at all.\n\u201d In other words , without the white man coming in to tell India and other middle-income countries how to make vaccines and provide them with his money , these countries would not be able to make vaccines on their own .\nThis is a rehash of the AIDS debate , when the Western governments and Big Pharma argued that developing generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor-quality medicines and theft of Western intellectual property .\nBill Gates , who built his fortune on Microsoft \u2019 s IP , is the leading defender of patent rights in the world .\nWith his newfound halo as a great philanthropist , he is leading Big Pharma \u2019 s charge against the weakening of patents on the global stage .\nThe role of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , a major funder of the World Health Organization , is also to dilute any move by the WHO to share patents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the largest manufacturers of existing vaccines by volume in the world , according to the WHO \u2019 s Global Vaccine Market Report 2020 .\nWhen it comes to measuring vaccine manufacturing by value , however , the global share held by multinational corporations or Big Pharma is much bigger than that of India .\nFor example , according to the WHO report , GlaxoSmithKline , with 11 % of the global market by volume , generates 40 % of the market by value , while the Serum Institute with 28 % of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of the market by value .\nThis shows that the patent-protected vaccines with monopoly pricing get much higher prices .\nThis is the model that Bill Gates and his ilk are selling .\nLet Big Pharma make the big bucks even if it bankrupts the poorer countries .\nThe Western philanthropic money of Gates and Warren Buffett will \u201c help \u201d the poor Third World to get some vaccines , albeit slowly .\nAs long as they get to call the shots .\nRSS and the fear of \u2018 socialism \u2019 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the central pillar of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) ideology \u2013 which serves as the ideological parent of the ruling BJP \u2013 that the task of the state is only to help big capital .\nAnything else including planning is seen by the right wing as socialism .\nIn the case of vaccines , it means not to make any attempt to get the companies , both in the public and private sectors , to make necessary preparations for a quick vaccination program : to put in the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , the government believed that India \u2019 s private pharmaceutical industry would do all of this on its own .\nIt forgot that the Indian pharmaceutical industry was the product of public-domain science \u2013 the CSIR institutions \u2013 the public sector and nationalist companies such as Cipla .\nThey all came out of the national movement and built India \u2019 s pharmaceutical industry .\nIt is institutions like the Haffkine Institute under Sahib Sokhey \u2019 s leadership and the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology ( CCMB ) built under the leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India \u2019 s vaccine and biologics capacity .\nIt is on this base that India \u2019 s vaccine manufacturing capacity rests .\nIt is not niji ( private ) companies that built the vaccine capacity in India , as Modi claims .\nThe private-sector companies rode on the back of public-sector science and technology that was built in the country between the 1950s and the 1990s .\nThe Indian government opened up vaccinations for all adults in the country on May 1 .\nTo vaccinate all the eligible population \u2013 above 18 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 billion doses of the vaccine in order to give the required two shots per person .\nTo plan for the production of an order of this size , apart from technology and capital support , India also needs to plan for the complex supply chain that is required for production .\nThis includes raw materials and intermediate supplies such as filters and special bags .\nThere are at least 37 \u201c critical items \u201d that are currently embargoed by the US from exports under the Defense Production Act of 1950 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean War .\nOn April 16 , Adar Poonawalla , head of the Serum Institute of India , took to Twitter to ask US President Joe Biden \u201c to lift the embargo of raw-material exports out of the US so that vaccine production can ramp up.\n\u201d If India had put together the production capacity of the Serum Institute , Bharat Biotech , Biological E , and Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd , and the five other companies that have signed up to manufacture Sputnik V , developed by the Gamaleya National Center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annual production capacity of more than 3 billion doses .\nIf it also included the public-sector units idling under the Modi government , India could have easily boosted its vaccine manufacturing capacity to 4 billion doses and produced the necessary 2 billion doses and more in 2021 .\nIt would then have made it possible for India to completely vaccinate its target population and yet have enough left to meet its export commitments including for the WHO \u2019 s Access to Covid-19 Tools ( ACT ) Accelerator program and its vaccines pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commission that could plan this exercise and create the political will to carry it forward .\nNot a vacuous Niti Ayog \u2013 the public policy think-tank of the Indian government \u2013 and an incompetent administration in New Delhi .\nInstead , the Modi government did not even bother to place an order with the Serum Institute until January 11 , and that too for a measly 11 million doses .\nThe next order of 120 million Covishield and Covaxin doses was placed only in the third week of March when the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well into its second wave .\nThe government seemed to bank on its belief in the magic of the capitalist market , which it thought would solve all its problems , without any real effort on New Delhi \u2019 s part .\nIndia and South Africa have asked the World Trade Organization to consider waiving the rules relating to intellectual property during the pandemic , and further sought that knowledge , including patents and know-how , should be shared without restrictions .\nThis proposal has been backed by the WHO and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Africa and Latin America .\nThe holdouts predictably are the rich countries that want to protect the global vaccine market for their Big Pharma companies .\nUnder pressure from the global community and the bad optics of the US hoarding vaccines , the Biden administration has finally decided to accept South Africa \u2019 s and India \u2019 s initiative of a temporary patent waiver , after stonewalling it in the WTO until now .\nBut this waiver is restricted to vaccine patents only and does not extend to other patents or associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s proposal had suggested .\nThis is still a victory for the global public health community , though only a first step .\nWhile India is spearheading the need to share know-how with all companies capable of manufacturing vaccines , it still has explaining to do as to why it has given an exclusive license to Bharat Biotech to manufacture a vaccine developed with public money and in public institutions such as ICMR and NIV .\nWhy is it not being shared under a non-exclusive license with both Indian companies and firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving royalties from sharing its know-how exclusively with Bharat Biotech .\nUnder public pressure , ICMR is now sharing its know-how with the Maharashtra state government \u2019 s public-sector Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corp , while giving Bharat Biotech six months \u2019 lead time with financial support money from the central government .\nModi had dreamed that India would be the vaccine arm of the Quad .\nHe forgot that in order to compete with China , India needs a vaccine production base that not only takes care of its own needs but also fulfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this because it has developed at least three vaccines already \u2013 from Sinopharm , Sinovac and CanSino \u2013 that have been licensed to others .\nTheir production is now being ramped up , and China is the largest supplier of vaccines to countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America .\nAnd it has also managed to control the spread of the virus that causes Covid-19 , unlike India .\nThis is

relentless barrage of nine typhoons and tropical storms slammed into Vietnam , setting off record floods and countless landslides .\nNearly 200 people died , and property damage was estimated at $ 1.5 billion .\nThen-Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc responded on Nov. 10 by calling for 1 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hopes that increased forest cover would help prevent future landslides and reduce flooding .\nThe billion-tree program is now official government policy with a number of aims , including protecting ecosystems , improving scenery , responding to climate change , and aiding economic development .\nBut the government has yet to release specifics on what species will be planted where and by whom , or the cost and source of funding .\nAnd while the initiative was created in the wake of natural disasters that heavily impacted communities in mountainous areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its emphasis elsewhere .\n\u201c The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development [ MARD ] created a draft circular , and if you look at it , 85 % of the trees are planned for urban areas and industrial zones , so only 15 % for upland areas , \u201d said Phuc Xuan To , a program analyst at the international NGO Forest Trends .\n\u201c Of course urban and industrial zones are important , but not as important for preventing and mitigating the impacts of floods and landslides caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to requests for comment .\nThe government directive outlining the program , which is only available in Vietnamese , notes that planting will be concentrated in urban areas , industrial zones , export-processing zones and traffic corridors , but does not indicate why .\nIt begins by noting the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on lives and property , and calls \u201c drastic forest development \u201d both \u201c an urgent task and a long-term strategic task.\n\u201d To be sure , a lack of green space is a chronic problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the government of Ho Chi Minh City , the country \u2019 s commercial center , says the city has just 0.55 square meters ( 6 square feet ) of public park per resident , compared to 30 m2 ( 326 ft2 ) per person in Singapore .\nCity officials have already begun planting trees under the program after years of urban tree loss due to infrastructure development .\nNonetheless , Phuc said he was surprised by this emphasis on cities .\n\u201c When Vietnamese people hear about 1 billion trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .\nThat many trees could create up to 500,000 hectares ( 1.2 million acres ) of new forest , but MARD \u2019 s plan calls for planting just 80,000 hectares ( 198,000 acres ) , with the rest of the trees going into urbanized areas , he added .\nOn April 4 , officials and volunteers planted 23 trees in an unfinished park along the Saigon River in Ho Chi Minh City , part of Vietnam \u2019 s plan to plant 1 billion trees by 2025 .\nMost of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nSome of the new trees have started to fade in Ho Chi Minh City \u2019 s dry-season heat .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nTree planting directed by the central government can be traced back to the late former president Ho Chi Minh , who began a Lunar New Year tradition of planting trees in 1959 , when Vietnam was divided into two countries .\nAccording to a yet-to-be-published research paper from 2020 about large-scale reforestation programs in Vietnam , 1992 saw the implementation of the 327 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million nationwide reforestation program .\nHowever , this was criticized for placing wood production over food security and focusing on exotic tree species such as eucalyptus and acacia .\nIn 1998 , the government introduced the national 5 Million Hectare Reforestation Program ( 5MHRP ) , which cost more than $ 1.5 billion through 2010 , dramatically increasing the scale of the 327 Project .\n5MHRP did not meet its area-based reforestation goals , and in some provinces encouraged the replacement of natural shrubland that local communities lived off with monoculture plantations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by smallholders .\nAcacia plantations dominate the landscape of Huong Tra district in central Vietnam \u2019 s Thua Thien-Hue province .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nNguyen Quang Hoa tending to seedlings at his home outside Hue , in Thua Thien-Hue province .\nMost plantations in the area grow a monocrop of acacia but Hoa plants long-lived native trees among the acacia on his plantation .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nSmallholders are a major aspect of forestry in Vietnam , as they control at least half of the country \u2019 s planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the mountains outside Hue , plantations are the main source of income for residents .\nPlantation forests generally offer fewer environmental benefits than native forest ecosystems ; for example , they shelter less wildlife , offer less protection from storms , and store less carbon .\nDespite these shortcomings , initiatives such as the 327 Project and 5MHRP did have an impact on raw forest figures .\nVietnam \u2019 s forest cover grew from 28 % of the country , or 9.4 million hectares ( 23 million acres ) , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million hectares ( 36 million acres ) , in 2020 , according to figures in the 2020 paper .\nBoth natural forests and plantations grew during this time , but plantations grew more rapidly , according to Open Development Mekong .\nAs of 2016 , natural forests comprised about 71 % of total tree cover ; of this , only 0.25 % is primary forest .\n\u201c On one hand , forest cover has expanded , so if that \u2019 s your metric , then reforestation has been somewhat successful , \u201c said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human ecology at Rutgers University in New Jersey , U.S. , who co-authored the 2020 paper .\n\u201c But it doesn \u2019 t say anything about the quality of forests and what their long-term status will be.\n\u201d McElwee said there are major regional differences in how reforestation has been pursued , given Vietnam \u2019 s diverse geography .\nWhile swaths of central Vietnam are now carpeted with non-native acacia plantations for harvesting , parts of the Mekong Delta have successfully expanded or , at the very least , maintained indigenous mangrove forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and protect coastal communities .\nNewly planted mangrove trees

forested hills and mountains .\nAt ground level , however , it becomes apparent that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monocrop plantations , mostly growing acacia , cover the lowlands and foothills leading up toward the rugged border with Laos .\nAcacia is not native to Vietnam , yet is has come to dominate this landscape , where thousands of smallholders grow it on harvest cycles of up to seven years for paper and timber production .\nThe forestry sector is of major economic significance , with the Vietnam Administration of Forestry aiming to hit $ 14 billion in exports this year .\n\u201c So acacia puts money in people \u2019 s pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not everyone is benefitting from it , \u201d McElwee said .\n\u201c There are different models elsewhere [ in Vietnam ] , for example some of the mangrove models rely on more diverse ecologies , but that does not happen with acacia : it is one species , and nothing else is there , and that \u2019 s not what people think of as a forest.\n\u201d Additionally , tall , thin acacia trees are easily knocked down in high winds , pulling up soil and increasing the risk of landslides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight on the roads of Thua Thien-Hue province .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nA former acacia plantation being prepared for the construction of an expressway near the city of Hue in Thua Thien-Hue province .\nInfrastructure development remains a major driver of tree loss in Vietnam .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nHuong Tra district , just outside of Hue in Thua Thien-Hue province , was lashed by last year \u2019 s storms , and nearby a series of landslides buried 17 workers at a hydropower dam , setting off a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only six bodies were ever recovered .\nEndless acacia plantations , the types encouraged and subsidized by previous reforestation programs , spread out from the narrow , pockmarked road that follows a valley .\nThe harvest rotations of small plots create a patchwork of 12-meter-tall ( 40-foot ) trees next to freshly cleared land .\nA tree farmer who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about his economic situation sat at a drink stall , taking a break from maintaining his land .\n\u201c I moved here in 2002 to start growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c If I sell them for material to make paper , they grow for four or five years , but to get timber it should be over seven years .\nEconomically , it doesn \u2019 t make that much money , and the soil is very hard to take care of.\n\u201d His simple concrete house down the road testifies to his meager income .\nAccording to the farmer , if he grows 1 hectare ( 2.5 acres ) of acacia for five years , he can sell it for $ 3,470 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month \u2014 and that is considered a good selling price .\nHe has about 3 hectares ( 7.4 acres ) of acacia and grows jackfruit , mango and banana trees around his home for supplemental income , as the soil on the valley floor is richer than on the hillsides .\n\u201c The acacia trees don \u2019 t hold water or soil , so when it rains , any good soil comes downhill , \u201d he said .\n\u201c On the highest parts of the hills , it can take 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would normally reach in seven years.\n\u201d When asked if he or his neighbors have planted anything other than acacia , he said that is all they know : \u201c But if I got to know about projects using other species , I \u2019 d love to learn about them.\n\u201d Cleared plantation plots alternate with growing acacia next to a reservoir in Huong Tra district .\nAreas such as this are counted as forest cover although compared to natural forest they provide far fewer environmental benefits such as carbon storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nIn fact , such reforestation efforts are underway across Vietnam thanks to conservation NGOs such as WWF-Vietnam and PanNature , as well as the initiative of individual farmers .\n\u201c In Vietnam , we focus too much on tree plantation initiatives where we just try to increase forest cover \u2014 wherever there are trees , it can count as forest \u2014 and we want to focus more on the quality and sustainability of those activities , \u201d said Nguyen Hai Van , PanNature \u2019 s deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted fast-growing trees like acacia , but for a long time nobody has talked about the sustainability of it , and there are so many questions on that issue.\n\u201d PanNature works with local communities , especially ethnic minority groups , in the Central Highlands and the mountainous northwest to revive traditional forest management methods .\n\u201c We try to restore forests and be very careful with which type of species we provide to the local people to plant , \u201d Van said .\n\u201c We consider the soil quality , the microclimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystem , what value and benefit people can get if they plant that tree.\n\u201d Nguyen Duc To Luu , PanNature \u2019 s resource governance program manager , added that they don \u2019 t strictly focus on trees either ; instead , they mix in shrubs , medicinal plants and fruit plants .\nThis gives people who rely on the forest for their livelihood a more diverse income source , while also avoiding the pitfalls of monocrop plantations .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t go for big plantations of industrial species , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by local people allocated with multipurpose species and mixed plantations , not just timber , \u201d Luu said .\n\u201c We provide not only the seedlings ; we take people from the beginning of seed production to plantation design to site selection and protection and care .\nWe try to create a long-term relationship with communities protecting the forest.\n\u201d PanNature also recently discovered a population of endangered northern white-cheeked gibbons ( Nomascus leucogenys ) near one of their project sites in Son La , a province in the remote northwest .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primates can feed on while extending their habitat through new mixed forests .\nNguyen Quang Hoa , left , and Phan Huu Tan at the latter \u2019 s farm .\nThe acacia behind them was planted in 2014 and trimmed in 2018 .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nIn Thua Thien-Hue , meanwhile , WWF-Vietnam is working with farmers like Nguyen Quang Hoa on an alternative method of reforestation that could provide a model for the billion-tree program .\n\u201c We still replant harvested acacia , but at the same time we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d Hoa said at his house next to a cemetery in the lowlands outside Hue .\n\u201c So when farmers want to take the acacia , they will just cut those and leave the others.\n\u201d This project is just a year old , but Hoa took us to a large farm owned by Phan Huu Tan in Huong Thuy district .\nSpread over 130 hectares ( 321 acres ) , Tan \u2019 s property is much larger than that of the average smallholder , and outside of acacia he also grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c I cut down a lot of trees earlier in my life in both Vietnam and Laos , and now I want to help grow them back , \u201d Tan said .\nWith support from WWF-Vietnam , he has carved out 7 hectares ( 17.3 acres ) for mixed planting , a move away from solely acacia .\nHere , 500 indigenous tree seedlings have been planted among 3,000 acacias on each hectare .\nThe indigenous species include Indian mahogany ( Chukrasia tabularis ) and resin tree ( Dipterocarpus alatus ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the mature acacia surrounding them .\n\u201c We will let them grow into my grandchildren \u2019 s generation , \u201d Tan said .\n\u201c But I don \u2019 t want to plant them too deep into the property , as I can \u2019 t monitor everything and I worry people will cut them down.\n\u201d He said he hopes to eventually expand the mixed-species area to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) , a goal that would add thousands of native , long-living trees to his property .\nHowever , Hoa noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acacia will outweigh the environmental benefits of more diverse , healthier forests .\n\u201c People who have a lot of land will probably volunteer some of it for projects like this , but if they don \u2019 t have much land , they won \u2019 t , because they know that if they grow native trees , it will be their grandchildren who inherit them , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Planting acacia is something they know works , and they don \u2019 t want to take the risk.\n\u201d Acacia at various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s farm .\nImage by Michael Tatarski .\nWhile any moves away from total reliance on acacia in central Vietnam remain relatively small-scale , it is a trend that forestry experts like Van , Phuc and McElwee want to see .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re going to talk about long-term adaptation , I \u2019 d want to see provincial departments of forestry starting to talk about the fact that acacia is not an appropriate species in that context , \u201d McElwee said .\n\u201c It is not a durable , deep-rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on smallholders moving away from it themselves .\nThey just can not afford it , so if you want to make money off of the sort of natural forest that \u2019 s more diverse , you need longer-term subsidies .\nYou \u2019 ve got to have money for households as they \u2019 re waiting for longer-term timber rotations.\n\u201d While it remains to be seen what kind of forest the billion-tree program will install in upland regions , Phuc , of Forest Trends , said that , ultimately , finding available land to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program \u2019 s biggest challenge there .\n\u201c There is quite a lot of land that could be used , but it is managed by local households , and you can not tell them to plant trees how you want , \u201d he said .\n\u201c On paper there is about one million hectares [ 2.5 million acres ] managed by local authorities , but in reality that has already been used by villagers for cultivation .\nIt \u2019 s extremely difficult to find land , and one reason 5MHRP failed is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plant trees.\n\u201d This , Phuc said , is a major reason why the government is focusing on urban areas when it comes to planting over the next five years , despite having created the billion-tree program in the context of devastating landslides and flooding in mountainous areas .\nUltimately , it may be residents of Vietnam \u2019 s fast-growing cities who benefit most from this latest national tree-planting campaign .\nAdditional urban tree cover would help combat worsening air pollution and reduce the heat-island effect caused by intense development .\nMeanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain amid vulnerable landscapes in the firing line of the country \u2019 s annual typhoon season , which is expected to become more

relationship .\nIndia has been literally eased out of two strategically important projects in Iran that were full of promise to uplift the ties in a medium and long term perspective .\nThe first was in July when Tehran dropped India from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chabahar port to Zahedan , along the border with Afghanistan .\nThe second has been the Iranian decision to award to a local company a contract worth USD 1.78 billion for the development of Farzad B Gas Field in the Persian Gulf , which India \u2019 s ONGC Videsh Ltd had discovered way back in 2008 .\nPlainly put , India has been booted out of the project .\nIn both cases , there was considerable delay on India \u2019 s part to negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement at government-to-government level , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed with the implementation of the projects without the involvement of Indian public sector companies .\nHaving said that , it was a political decision no doubt that Tehran took , considering the highly strategic nature of the two projects for not only bilateral ties but regional politics as well .\nWhile Farzad B Gas Field would have strengthened India \u2019 s energy security , the Chabahar-Zahedan rail line would be a vital link in regional connectivity for India with land-locked Afghanistan and the Central Asian region .\nIn the latter case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective political role in Afghanistan could get impaired .\nFundamentally , these setbacks are to be attributed to the lack of strategic clarity in India \u2019 s policies toward Iran and the Persian Gulf region on the whole .\nCertain serious aberrations had crept into the Indian regional policies in the Persian Gulf in the recent 3-4 years since 2017 that negatively impacted Iran \u2019 s core strategic interests .\nTo recap , in a marked departure from the traditional policy not to take sides in the perennial inter-state tensions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , India began to identify itself with the countries of the anti-Iran regional front that the former US President Donald Trump was sponsoring \u2014 involving Israel , Saudi Arabia and the UAE .\nHow far the US encouraged India to be a \u2018 swing \u2019 state to give ballast to the Israel-Saudi-UAE front or whether the Indian \u2018 tilt \u2019 was a suo moto decision is a moot point today .\nMost likely , it was a combination of both templates , stemming out of a deeply flawed Indian assessment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian policy got predicated on an entirely unwarranted assumption that the US-led Israel-Saudi-Emirati bandwagon was irrevocably on the ascendance in regional politics and it would be advantageous for India to get on board as a fellow traveller .\nIndeed , Indian strategic community contributed significantly to this mishap .\nWith the signing of the Abraham Accords last August , Indian analysts were convinced that the country \u2019 s regional strategies in the Persian Gulf and West Asian region would be best served by forging even closer links with the Us-Israeli-Saudi-Emirati axis .\nTwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time titled India \u2019 s geopolitical interests are in close alignment with moderate Arab centreand India must seize the new strategic possibilities with the Gulf and a piece penned by a former Indian diplomat in the Times of Israel titled Why India supports the Abraham Accord stand out as forceful presentation of the case .\n( here , here and here ) Unfortunately , the seductive arguments propagating the US-Israeli-Saudi-Emirati axis were falling on very receptive ears in the corridors of power in Delhi .\nThey happened to fit in perfectly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nascent quasi-alliance between India and steadily elevate it to a military alliance dovetailing with Washington \u2019 s so-called Indo-Pacific strategy against China in the geopolitical space from Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean .\nWasn \u2019 t India aware that the raison d \u2019 \u00eatre of the US-Israeli-Saudi-Emirati front aimed at isolating Iran in its region and overthrowing the established regime in that country ?\nOf course , Trump and his regional allies had left Delhi in no doubt whatsoever on that score .\nBut , simply put , Delhi had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been traditionally a friendly country that never encroached upon India \u2019 s vital interests and had consistently sought a close friendly partnership with India .\nWithout doubt , Tehran began noticing the shift in the Indian attitudes .\nWhile Delhi \u2019 s muted response to the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital ( December 2017 ) signalled new churning , the enthusiastic welcome that Delhi extended to the Abraham Accords ( August 2020 ) would have made Tehran sit up .\nIndeed , Delhi kept silent when Iran \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed ( January 2020 ) on Trump \u2019 s orders and when a top Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated by Israel .\nDelhi no longer bothered to hide its special relations with the UAE and Saudi Arabia with accent on security cooperation , notwithstanding the two countries \u2019 growing hostility toward Iran .\nIn retrospect , India was cruising through a fantasyland , completely out of touch with the realities .\nThen the inevitable happened in a rapid sequence \u2014 Trump lost the November election ; Biden swung toward putting the US \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; US began debating retrenchment from the West Asian region so as to focus on the Asia-Pacific ; US stance on Palestinian issue reverted to the default position ; and , most important , disregarding protests by Israel , Saudi Arabia and the UAE , Biden decided to engage with Iran .\nOf course , the lifting of the US sanctions against Iran , which is on the horizon , will completely realign the security scenario in the Persian Gulf .\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE are already scrambling to engage Iran on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound transition that is expected in regional security .\nAbove all , the notions stemming out of the Abraham Accords have died a sudden death .\nTh current conflict in Gaza even accentuates Israel \u2019 s isolation .\nMeanwhile , Iran \u2019 s surge is in the cards .\nThe lifting of US sanctions and ensuing integration into the world economy will dramatically change the geopolitics of Iran .\nIran is a very rich country , and with or without India \u2019 s cooperation , it will embark on an ambitious programme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent 25-year , $ 400 billion pact of economic cooperation with China .\nFrom the Indian perspective , the easing of tensions in Iran \u2019 s problematic relationship with Saudi Arabia should be seized as a window of opportunity to inject new dynamism into the Indian policy .\nIndia should quietly bury the disastrous Gulf policy trajectory of the recent years built on wrong assumptions and act quickly to revive the verve of the Iran-India cooperation .\nReviving the purchase of Iranian oil

crisis in ties between the two neighboring countries , which the Burmese have traditionally described as pauk paw relations , those between \u201c distant cousins .\nThe well-known proverb , \u201c sleeping in the same bed , dreaming different dreams , \u201d aptly describes this relationship , especially since 1988 .\nIn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Ne Win collapsed and was violently replaced by a younger generation of generals , initially loyal to Ne Win , who formed a junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC , after 1997 known as the State Peace and Development Council ) .\nBoth before and after this power seizure , the Burmese military killed thousands of demonstrators nationwide .\nConsciously , the generals sought to mimic China \u2019 s economic success by fostering economic liberalization while retaining a tight grip on political power , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist Vietnam since the opening of its 1986 Doi Moi reforms .\nThey had considerable sympathy for Deng Xiaoping when he ordered the suppression of political dissidents , resulting in the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing on June 4 , 1989 .\nDeng \u2019 s determination to aggressively protect the supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party and prevent any alternative , more democratic political evolution found resonance in the leadership of the Tatmadaw , Burma \u2019 s armed forces , and some observers suggest that Deng \u2019 s use of violent force had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protesters the year before ( Seekins , 1997 : 532 ) .\nA series of foreign investment laws were decreed by the junta following the establishment of the SLORC on September 18 , 1988 , but the generals \u2019 dreams of Burma becoming the next \u201c tiger \u201d economy in Southeast Asia were thwarted not only by their own inept and corrupt management , but also by sanctions imposed by western countries , especially the United States and the European Union .\nEven Japan , Burma \u2019 s largest donor of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , exercised self-restraint in extending new loans and grants during the SLORC/SPDC years ( Seekins , 2007 : 115-148 ) .\nChina and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( especially Thailand , Singapore and Malaysia ) ignored the call for sanctions by the West and endeavoured to enrich themselves through \u201c constructive engagement \u201d with Burma \u2019 s junta .\nOne of the first steps in the development of a flourishing Sino-Burmese economic relationship was the normalization of legal trade along the 2,227 kilometre-long border between Burma and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Beijing to Rangoon the following year , which totalled the equivalent of some US $ 1.0-US $ 1.4 billion ( Lintner , 1999 : 387-389 , 470 ) .\nThere were some rough spots in Sino-Burmese relations after 1988 , including in 2009 when fighting broke out between the Tatmadaw and insurgents belonging to the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army ( MDNAA , also known as the Kokang Group ) in the Kokang region of northeast Shan State , which caused 37,000 largely Han Chinese Kokang people to flee to Chinese soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn March 2015 , bombs were mistakenly dropped by the Burmese air force across the border in Yunnan Province , killing five Chinese nationals ; Beijing responded saying it would take stern action if such an incident happened again

Silk Road Spirit , \u201d 2019 ) .\nIn 2011 , the SPDC junta was replaced by a hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed that President ( and retired General ) Thein Sein was departing from the Chinese model by promoting political as well as economic liberalization .\nA highly sensitive issue in bilateral ties was his decision to suspend construction of the giant Myitsone Dam in northernmost Kachin State , which was to generate electricity primarily for China \u2019 s Yunnan Province rather than Burma ( Seekins , 2017 : 372 , 373 ) .\nIn some ways a bolder democratic reformer than Aung San Suu Kyi

priorities of Burma \u2019 s ruling generals were to pursue economic development utilizing China \u2019 s aid and investment .\nMoreover , the Tatmadaw came to depend on imports of made-in-China arms after 1989 , although it also acquired weapons and militarily-applicable technology from Russia , Israel , Singapore , and , reportedly , North Korea .\nVarious border groups , including the @ @ @ @ @

Ocean and beyond .\nIn 2013 , President Xi Jinping announced his ambitious One Belt , One Road Initiative , in which Burma became a key piece in Beijing \u2019 s geopolitical jigsaw puzzle , extending its influence into areas that previously had not historically been subject to the expansion of Chinese military , political or cultural power : South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly antagonistic India ) , West Asia , East and Central Europe and Africa , where China has a large and growing economic presence.1 Chinese fears that after Daw Suu Kyi \u2019 s party , the National League for Democracy , won a landslide victory in the General Election of November 2015 she would promote closer relations with the West at China \u2019 s expense proved unfounded .\nAs western countries grew increasingly critical of her after she expressed indifference to the Tatmadaw \u2019 s persecution of Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine ( Arakan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that Beijing provided for her , as well as for the generals with whom she uneasily co-existed , an indispensable alternative in order to evade a possible new rollout of western sanctions .\nHer visit to the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 2019 to deny that the Tatmadaw had been involved in genocide of Rohingyas only reaffirmed this pivot away from her former western supporters toward China and other Asian countries .\nThe coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat of February 1 , 2021 , however , upset the expectations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere is evidence to suggest that Beijing had very mixed feelings about the establishment of a new martial law regime , the State Administration Council ( SAC ) , headed by commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing .\nThese reservations seemed to increase after the SAC began escalating deadly violence against civilian protesters , most of them unarmed , leading to more than 740 deaths of ordinary citizens , including children , by late April .\nWith long-term instability and even civil war inside Burma almost a certainty , the coup threatens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ambitious vision of the One Belt/One Road , still promoted as a centrepiece of Xi Jinping \u2019 s diplomacy in 2021 .\nThe histories of Burma and Vietnam , both located on the Indochina Peninsula , reveal a striking contrast : while ( northern ) Vietnam became a Chinese colony during the Han Dynasty and gained its independence only in 939 CE , resisting numerous invasions by China in the centuries following , Burma was largely shielded from projections of Chinese power by the existence of non-Chinese states in what is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s entire land border with China .\nThe state of Nan Zhao was not only a formidable opponent of the Tang Dynasty , but also extended its power into the central valley of the Irrawaddy River in Burma before entering into decline , to be succeeded by the state of Dali .\nOnly in the thirteenth century , after Kublai Khan \u2019 s Mongol forces subjugated Dali and occupied Yunnan , did they enter territory controlled by unified Burma \u2019 s first royal house , the Pagan Dynasty ( 1044-ca .\n1300 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourteenth century .\nThe last major king of that dynasty , Narathihapate ( r. 1254-1287 ) , earned the inglorious title \u201c the king who fled from the Chinese \u201d ( Seekins , 2017 : 378 , 379 ) .2 Although a majority of Burma \u2019 s different ethnic groups speak languages related in some degree to Chinese , the evolution of Burma \u2019 s state , society and culture was deeply influenced by India rather than China , as reflected in its political and social thought , art , literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion .\nNinety percent of Burma \u2019 s population are adherents to Theravada Buddhism , which has been influenced profoundly by religious exchanges with Buddhist kingdoms in Sri Lanka .\nAlthough a Manchu army invaded central Burma in the mid-17th century in search of one of the last princes of the Ming imperial house , it was only in the mid-eighteenth century that the Qing Dynasty posed a serious threat to Burma , now ruled by kings of the Konbaung Dynasty ( 1752-1885 ) .\nDuring the 1760s , the Manchus launched several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burmese and Qing over control of the Shan ( Tai ) princedoms in what are now Yunnan and eastern Burma .\nFinally , a major invasion led by Ming Rui , a son-in-law of the Qian Long Emperor , and including elite Manchu and Mongol troops was initiated , but it too was defeated by Burmese armies led by the intrepid general Maha Thiha Thiru in 1769 .\nThe reigning king at that time , Hsinbyushin ( 1763-1776 ) , earned the title \u201c the king who fought the Chinese.\n\u201d His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while the Sino-Burmese War was taking place , his armies had also invaded Siam and captured the Thai capital of Ayuthia in 1767.3 The Sino-Burmese Treaty of Kaungton included , as a face-saving measure , the promise of the Burmese to send a tribute mission to Beijing every ten years to pay homage to the Qing Emperor ; but a major result of the war was the establishment of a rough boundary between Shan States ruled by China and those ruled by Burma which was recognized up to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the contemporary boundary agreement between Burma and China in 1961 ( Seekins , 2017 : 147 , 148 , 250 ) .\nThe Chinese presence in Burma was stabilized during the period of British colonial rule .\nHaving annexed Lower Burma in wars occurring in 1824-1826 and 1852 , the British occupied Upper Burma and its royal capital of Mandalay in 1885 , sending King Thibaw into exile in India and bringing an end to the Konbaung Dynasty .\nThe British-enforced colonial economy carried out limited direct trade with China , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability , save for commerce initiated by so-called \u201c mountain Chinese , \u201d also known as Panthays , a Muslim minority located in Yunnan whose pack trains wound their way south as far as Rangoon .\nThey had carried out a revolt against the Qing authorities in Yunnan between 1856 and 1873 but found safety under the umbrella of British rule .\nKokang , a small state located in the eastern Shan States , was established by Chinese supporters of the Ming Dynasty fleeing the Manchus in the seventeenth century .\nIts hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yang family , controlled a small population of Han Chinese and indigenous ethnic groups .\nIn the early twentieth century , Kokang became a centre for the notorious cultivation and trade in opium which served a huge market in China ( Seekins , 2017 : 305 , 306 ) .\nLarge cities such as Rangoon ( Yangon ) , Moulmein ( Mawlamyine ) and Mandalay had overseas Chinese communities , mostly people from Guangdong and Fujian Provinces similar to those residing in Thailand , Malaysia and Singapore .\nTies between Overseas Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those living in the British-ruled Straits Settlements , especially Penang , were strong ( Thaw Kaung , 2004 ) .\nRangoon \u2019 s \u201c Chinatown \u201d ( B. Tayoketan ) is still located in the western part of the city \u2019 s central business district ( Latha and Lanmadaw Townships ) , a distinct area the streets of which are lined with Chinese temples , restaurants and shops , of which gold shops are particularly prominent .\nIn 1931 , the colonial capital of Rangoon had a population of only around 7.6 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tayoketan , while residents of South Asian origin comprised the majority , or 53.2 percent .\nIndigenous Burmese comprised only 35 percent ( Seekins , 2011 : 39 ) .\nThese demographics show that the economic focus of Rangoon and Lower Burma was on British India ( present-day India , Pakistan and Bangladesh ) rather than on China .\nIn fact , until 1937 , Burma was a province of British India .\nBetween South Asians , mostly Hindus and Muslims , and Buddhist Burmese there was considerable racial friction and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations between the indigenous people and Chinese residents tended to be more amicable , due in large measure to the fact that as in Thailand , the Chinese often assimilated into Burmese society and even adopted the Theravada Buddhist religion ( Ibid.\n, 39-41 ; Lintner , 1999 : 67 ) .\nThe famous \u201c Burma Road \u201d linking the port of Rangoon with the Yunnan capital of Kunming and Jiang Jieshi \u2019 s wartime capital of Chongqing was constructed in the late 1930s by the Allies to provide Jiang \u2019 s government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cut off by Japanese forces in 1942 .\nIn the unsuccessful attempt to defend Burma from Japanese occupation , British forces fought alongside the Kuomintang army in northern Burma .\nAlthough the Japanese did not extend their control into Yunnan , which was ruled by a local warlord , Long Yun , the Burma-China border became a vital front in the War .\nA remote area that had been previously the neglected \u201c backyard \u201d of both China and Burma began to be part of a huge \u201c geography lesson \u201d learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , London , New Delhi and Tokyo .\nIn 1944 , \u201c Merrill \u2019 s Marauders , \u201d an American military unit , entered northern Burma from India and captured the airstrip at Myitkyina in what is now Kachin State , lost it to a Japanese counter-offensive and then recaptured it in August .\nFrom Myitkyina , Allied aircraft could fly more easily to bring supplies to Jiang \u2019 s wartime capital .\nThe Allies also built the 1,726 kilometre-long Ledo Road , which connected India and China by land via northern Burma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 320 , 347 , 575-577 ) .\nBecause of the War , the hitherto remote Burma-China border area was opened up , temporarily , to the outside world and Myitkyina \u2019 s airport became one of the busiest in the world .\nAlthough British forces , composed largely of Indian soldiers , liberated ( or re-occupied ) the country in 1945 , fighting bloody battles in Upper Burma , the British colonial period was almost at an end .\nBurma achieved independence on January 4 , 1948 , and nationalist leader U Nu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Burma .\nRelations between the Union of Burma and the People \u2019 s Republic of China , officially proclaimed in October 1949 , were cordial .\nPrime Minister U Nu , who would become a fervent proponent of the Non-Aligned Movement , was the first non-Soviet bloc leader to recognize the communist regime .\nRangoon and Beijing found a common purpose when so-called Chinese Irregular Forces , loyal to the Nationalists or Kuomintang , sought to open a \u201c second front \u201d against the communists ( the first being Taiwan ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint military operation by China \u2019 s People \u2019 s Liberation Army and the Tatmadaw dealt a hard blow to these intruders in 1961 , their remnants continued to play a major role in local unrest and the opium economy inside the infamous \u201c Golden Triangle.\n\u201d The appearance of the Chinese Irregular Forces in the Shan States also led to great tension between U Nu \u2019 s government and Washington , since the US Central Intelligence Agency underwrote the establishment of Kuomintang bases in this corner of Burma ( Seekins , 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111-120 ) .\nA major achievement of the government of U Nu was completion of a border agreement with China in January 1961 , which resulted in the mutual exchange of small patches of territory ( Seekins , 2017 : 144 , 145 ) .\nBut loss of territory in Kachin State to the Chinese alienated the local Kachins , and was a factor in their establishment of a major ethnic armed organization , the Kachin Independence Army , during the 1960s ( Lintner , 1999 : 486 ) .\nPrime Minister U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government \u201d headed by Tatmadaw commander General Ne Win to deal with deep conflict among civilian politicians ( it lasted from 28 October 1958 to April 1960 ) , but Burma entered a long , dark valley of military rule , lasting for decades , following Ne Win \u2019 s coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat of March 2 , 1962 .\nHe set up a Revolutionary Council ( RC ) composed of military officers who ran the country by decree and also established a \u201c revolutionary party \u201d known as the Burma Socialist Programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel hierarchy which controlled state organs in a manner similar to the communist parties in China and the Soviet Union .\nThe RC shut down most trade and other links with the outside world and pushed development of a self-sufficient socialist economy based on state ownership and management of major economic enterprises , which left the country suspended in a time warp of deepening poverty .\nThe economy of the \u201c Burmese Road to Socialism \u201d was comprised of 23 state-owned corporations and a burgeoning black market that expanded to include a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official economy .\nNe Win , whose original name was Shu Maung , was Sino-Burmese .\nHowever , he was careful to downplay his half-Chinese identity in order to solidify his image as a Burmese , or Burman , patriot .\nRelations with Beijing continued to be cordial , including the provision of aid to Burma by the Chinese government ; but as China fell into the throes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s , this changed abruptly .\nSchools had been nationalized and \u201c Burmanized \u201d under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were large numbers of restive ethnic Chinese students .\nWhen the Chinese embassy encouraged these students to support the Cultural Revolution by holding \u201c struggle sessions \u201d and wearing badges with Mao Zedong \u2019 s portrait on them , riots broke out in June 1967 between them and local Burmese , who were resentful over Chinese domination of the black market .\nIn what were probably the worst riots since the colonial period , Burmese mobs killed local Chinese ( the official number was 50 , but the Chinese claimed there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and shops .\nAt the end of June , the mobs went on to attack the Chinese Embassy , and one of its officials was killed .\nThe Chinese responded by withdrawing their ambassador , cutting off aid to Burma and using its media to condemn Ne Win as a \u201c fascist \u201d dictator .\nMany Overseas Chinese fled Burma .\nThere was evidence that in order to find an outlet for popular economic frustrations under socialism , Ne Win secretly encouraged rioters to attack the Chinese ( Mya Maung , 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 , 1968 , Chinese-trained and equipped troops of the People \u2019 s Army ( PA ) , the armed force of the Communist Party of Burma ( CPB ) , stormed across the China-Burma border in northeast Shan State .\nThey and subsequent reinforcements easily defeated local forces who were either independent or connected in some way to the Ne Win regime .\nThe People \u2019 s Army soon became the strongest regional insurgency facing the Tatmadaw .\nIt established bases , supported by China , in Kokang , the Wa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regularly threw back Tatmadaw offensives sent against them by the central government .\nAlthough the aim of the new communist Northeast Command was the overthrow of Ne Win \u2019 s regime , it was never able to gain , or regain , military or political influence inside central Burma , where the majority Burmans lived and where the CPB had been previously active .\nAlthough the party \u2019 s leadership was Burman , by the 1980s most of the PA \u2019 s 15,000 soldiers were members of local ethnic minorities Although many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 establishment of communist bases in Shan State was meant to \u201c punish \u201d Ne Win for the anti-Chinese riots of the previous year , there is ample evidence to suggest that some form of Beijing-backed intervention had been planned and organised as far back as 1962 , when Ne Win came to power .\nChina-Burma relations were normalized after the riots , and regular diplomatic ties restored , but the China-supported insurgency continued on the \u201c two track \u201d principle : that the Chinese state could have regular diplomatic ties with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Communist Party would continue to pursue its own \u201c fraternal relations \u201d with the local communist party ( Seekins , 1997 : 528 ) .\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s , about 140 members of the Communist Party of Burma sojourned in China , waiting for the opportunity to return home when the time was right for socialist revolution ( Lintner , 1999 : 170 ) .\nThe Men who \u201c Made Deals with the Chinese , \u201d 1988-2011 If Narathihapate was the \u201c king who fled from the Chinese \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese , \u201d the leaders of Burma \u2019 s second junta , the State Law and Order Restoration Council , were the men who \u201c made deals with the Chinese .\nIn 1988 , the greatest obstacle to deeper engagement between Rangoon and Beijing was the presence of the People \u2019 s Army in Shan State , though China \u2019 s support for this insurgency gradually declined over the years after it had entered Burma \u2019 s frontier region in 1968 , causing it to increase opium sales in order to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 528 ) .\nHowever , in March-April 1989 an event of immense importance took place : a mutiny of ethnic minority soldiers , mostly Wa , against the Burman leadership of the CPB , which led to the return of those leaders to exile in China and breakup of the People \u2019 s Army into four separate forces : the United Wa State Army ( UWSA ) , the largest , the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army ( or Kokang Group ) , the National Democratic Alliance Army , Eastern Shan State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army ( NDA ) in Kachin State .\nThese movements rejected revolutionary Marxism-Leninism , and devoted themselves to ethnic nationalism and continued participation in the highly lucrative drug trade ( Lintner , 1999 : 363 , 364 , 480 ) .\nThrough the mediation of Lo Hsing-han , a Kokang Chinese who gained notoriety as the \u201c king of the Golden Triangle \u201d for his role in the drug trade , the SLORC was able to negotiate cease-fires with these four groups , which included not only a cessation of hostilities between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also recognition of their right to bear arms and control of the territories where they were based .\nOn the SLORC \u2019 s side , General Khin Nyunt , the much-feared director of Burma \u2019 s Military Intelligence or secret police , played the key role in making these arrangements , which gave him considerable power and influence in the border areas until he was purged in October 2004 .\nThe cease-fires , which were expanded to include other ethnic armed organizations such as the Kachin Independence Army , the New Mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( led by the second \u201c king of the Golden Triangle , \u201d Khun Sa , in central Shan State ) , and the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army \u2013 grew to a total of 18 armed groups by 1997 ( Seekins , 2017 : 136 , 137 ) .\nThe cease-fire system , through which Khin Nyunt assiduously built his power base , had profound consequences for Burma \u2019 s border areas , which previously had been largely beyond the Rangoon government \u2019 s control .\nFirstly , it allowed the junta to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , preventing the ethnic forces from building a durable united front against the Burman-dominated military regime ; and secondly , the period of relative peace in the border areas enabled China to cultivate a major economic presence not only in Shan State and other minority areas , but in Upper Burma as a whole , including the city of Mandalay .\nThe United Wa State Army commanded by Bao Youxiang prospered because of its major share of the production and export of narcotics by way of Yunnan and northern Thailand .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-equipped fighting force of 20,000 to 25,000 men and the infrastructure in and around its \u201c capital \u201d of Panghsang is superior to that of other parts of Burma .\nIn order to expedite the drug trade , the UWSA in 1999 moved approximately 100,000 Wa villagers to the Thai-Burma border near the Thai border town of Tachilek .\nAt that time , the UWSA was the one ethnic armed organisation that matched the Tatmadaw in firepower , a situation that remains true today .\nIn effect , the Wa-dominated areas of Shan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Thailand constitute a nearly independent mini-state ( Seekins , 2017 : 558 , 559 ) .\nSince 1989 , Chinese involvement in the Burmese economy \u2013 and indirectly its society and politics \u2013 has involved diverse Chinese , Sino-Burmese and Burmese actors and relationships : the most visible was the support given by the Chinese state directly to the SLORC/SPDC , in the form of economic aid and weapons sales , as well as \u201c moral \u201d support , which was decisive in preventing the United Nations Security Council from taking any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s numerous human rights abuses , including large-scale ethnic cleansing of people in minority areas like Shan and Karen States.5 Secondly , Chinese state-owned enterprises , such as Chinese army-owned Northern Industries Company , or NORINCO , formed ambitious joint ventures with companies owned by the Tatmadaw , especially two wholly-owned conglomerates , the Union of Myanmar Economic Corporation ( UMEC ) and the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings ( UMEH ) .\nThe prevalence of state- or army-owned conglomerates in both countries made economic cooperation between them smoother than dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any size .\nIn addition , Chinese private enterprise , much of it based in Yunnan Province , entered Burma on its own and an unknown number of Chinese individuals left their homeland to sojourn inside Burma , much as their forebears had migrated to Lower Burma , Thailand , and the Malay Peninsula.6 Important players in this emerging economic system were the Chinese or Sino-Burmese leaders of ethnic armed organizations who controlled Burma \u2019 s flourishing drug economy .\nThe most important figures were the Pheung , or Peng , brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the first \u201c king of the Golden Triangle \u201d ) , Yang Molian ( Kokang Group ) , and Khun Sa , also known as Chang Chi-fu ( Mong Tai Army , the second \u201c king of the Golden Triangle \u201d after Lo was arrested ) .\nBao Youxiang was an ethnic Wa , but like many of his fellow Was took a Chinese name .\nBoth Lo and Khun Sa lived to enjoy comfortable retirements in Rangoon where they oversaw profitable companies , including Asia World , one of Burma \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s son Steven Law ( Seekins , 2017 : 326 ) .\nDuring the SLORC/SPDC period , the cease-fires in Shan and Kachin States caused a rapid increase in the export of narcotics , including not only opiates but yaabaa ( Thai , \u201c crazy medicine \u201d ) or \u201c speed \u201d to markets around the world .\nBurma earned the dubious distinction , alternating with Afghanistan , of being the world \u2019 s largest exporter of drugs .\nThe drug warlords acquired huge amounts of cash that needed to be laundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this money , they invested in luxury hotels , housing developments and other projects in Mandalay and Rangoon , most of the purchasers being Chinese .\nHlaing Thayar and Mingaladon Townships in Rangoon became the site for several of these developments , which look like upscale suburban housing in Southern California.7 Thant Myint-U quotes a Columbia University economist , Ronald Findlay , who said that \u201c ( t ) he seed capital of the Burmese economy is heroin

cease-fires .\nThese include Panghsang ( former \u201c capital \u201d of the CPB/PA , now controlled by the UWSA ) , Mong La ( controlled by the National Democratic Alliance Army- Eastern Shan State ) , a vest pocket Sodom-and-Gomorrah popular with Chinese tourists in search of casinos , prostitutes , \u201c ladyboys \u201d and drugs ) , Muse ( which is connected to China by two bridges , the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge \u201d because shipments of arms from China were conveyed over it ) and Ruili opposite Muse on the Chinese side of the border , which in recent years has also enjoyed explosive growth .\nRuili and Wanding , another Chinese border town , gained special privileges through their Beijing-granted status as \u201c special economic zones.\n\u201d Laiza , on the border with China in Kachin State , is considered the \u201c capital \u201d of the Kachin Independence Army but \u2013 perhaps because of the KIA \u2019 s largely Baptist leadership \u2013 possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mong La .\nIn the border towns on the Burmese side , the atmosphere is quite un-Burmese , with Putonghua being spoken widely , Chinese restaurants lining the streets and renminbi being circulated instead of Burmese kyats .\nCasinos are located inside huge , gaudy hotels reminiscent of Macau or Las Vegas ( Seekins , 2017 : 316 , 359 , 364 , 424 ) .\nAlthough Beijing stepped in early to develop trade links and provide the Tatmadaw with weapons , the largest quantities of foreign investment during the early SLORC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore .\nChina \u2019 s investments remained relatively modest until the first years of the 21stcentury , and by 2010-2011 China \u2019 s FDI ( foreign direct investment ) was the largest committed by any country , amounting to an estimated US $ 13.0 billion ( Sun Yun , 2012 : 63 ) .\nChinese official development assistance ( ODA ) was only around US $ 100 million in the mid-1990s , but grew to US $ 2.2 billion by 2012 , making China Burma \u2019 s largest aid donor ( Mizuno , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was responsible for opening up the remotest parts of Burma \u2019 s frontier region to the outside world , including bridges over many rivers and reconstruction of the famous Ledo and Burma Roads .\nIn 2011 , China became Burma \u2019 s largest single trade partner ( Ibid.\n, 199-202 ) .\nBurma-China trade after 1988 began to resemble the \u201c colonial \u201d economies of Southeast Asia before World War II : the export of raw materials in exchange for consumer and manufactured goods .\nAccording to this writer : In the 1993-94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major exports to Burma were beverages , tobacco , textiles , garments , machinery , vehicles and transport equipment .\nThe most important legal Burmese exports to China were food , wood , lumber , pearls and precious stones .\nAlthough Chinese machinery , vehicles and transport equipment can be utilized to upgrade Burma \u2019 s industry and infrastructure , most Chinese products , such as the large volume of beverage and tobacco imports , were directed toward \u201c passive \u201d consumer markets in a manner reminiscent of relations between a European metropole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th century ( Seekins , 1997 : 529 ) .\nMandalay , Burma \u2019 s second city , was transformed by the Chinese presence ( see footnote 6 , above ) .\nThis city , comparable to Kyoto in Japan as a former royal capital and cultural centre , containing many Buddhist monasteries and sacred sites , became one big \u201c Chinatown \u201d as Chinese investors bought up property in its urban centre while local Burmese , unable to afford rising property prices , were forced to move to the city \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 50,000 Chinese settled in Mandalay , out of a total population of around 1.0 million ( Seekins , 1997 : 530 ) .\nA common practice was for the sojourners to purchase the identity cards of deceased local people in northern Burma , whose deaths were not reported to the authorities .\nPossession of such cards enabled Chinese people to gain a Burmese passport with no questions asked ( Lintner , 1993 : 26 ) .\nLike Shan State and Mandalay , Kachin State felt the impact of the Chinese economic presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was especially true after the KIA signed a cease-fire in 1994 .\nAlthough the truce marked the end of decades of bitter fighting , in subsequent years the SLORC/SPDC was able to take over many of Kachin State \u2019 s rich economic resources , including forests and the mines at Hpakant , which provided wealthy Chinese buyers in China and Southeast Asia with the world \u2019 s highest quality \u201c imperial \u201d jade .\nMany poor people from other parts of Burma worked at the mines under hellish conditions , including landslides that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s mountainsides were stripped of trees which were shipped off to China , causing severe environmental damage , and the miners at Hpakant provided Chinese markets with larger and larger quantities of jade , trade which amounted to billions of dollars .\nIn northern Kachin State , the Hukawng Valley has deposits of gold and amber .\nBut neither the KIA nor the local Kachins benefited .\nA disturbing sign of social decay was that as many as 80 percent of young Kachins were addicted to drugs .\nIn 2011 , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KIA , and tens of thousands of Kachins and other minorities were forced to flee their homes ( Thant Myint-U , 2020 : 169 , 198 , 199 ) .\nOne of the more unusual aspects of the Burma-China relationship was \u201c Buddhist diplomacy.\n\u201d A Buddha tooth relic had been brought from India to China during the Tang Dynasty ( 618 \u2013 907 CE ) and was enshrined at the imperial capital of Chang \u2019 an , but fell into obscurity until the early 20th century when it was discovered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the People \u2019 s Republic of China is officially atheist , the Beijing government sent the tooth relic on \u201c visits \u201d to several neighbouring countries where local Buddhists could venerate it .\nIt was sent to Burma in the mid-1950s when Prime Minister U Nu was holding a Great Buddhist Council in Rangoon to celebrate the 2,500 anniversary of Gotama Buddha \u2019 s attainment of nibbana ( nirvana ) .\nAs Burma is a country of very devout Buddhists ( \u201c to be Burmese is to be Buddhist \u201d ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic twice again , in 1994 and 1996-1997 during the SLORC/SPDC era , was a powerful means of legitimizing the bilateral relationship ( Seekins , 2017 : 120 ) .\nIn November-December 2011 , the tooth relic was sent a fourth time to Burma , where it was placed for veneration by devotees at the Uppattasanti Pagoda in the country \u2019 s new capital of Naypyidaw for 45 days ( Ibid .\n; Sun Yun , 2012 : 65 ) .8 In early 2011 , when the SPDC was dissolved and Thein Sein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the \u201c hybrid \u201d civilian-military system defined by the 2008 Constitution , China was working on three

controversial .\nThe first was the dual China-Myanmar Oil and Gas Pipelines , which , when they were completed in 2014 , ran in a parallel fashion 793 kilometres from Kyaukphyu in Rakhine ( Arakan ) State by way of centrally-located Magway ( Magwe ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiting at the border towns of Muse-Ruili .\nA joint venture of the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise and China National Petroleum Company , the pipelines would help alleviate a worrying bottleneck in China \u2019 s energy exports from the Middle East and the Shwe Gas Field , offshore from Rakhine State .\nThis was the Straits of Malacca , between Malaysia and Indonesia , which since antiquity had guarded the passage to and from the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea .\nIf confrontation with the United States and its allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese shipping by the US Navy , the project would provide cities as far east as Nanning , the capital of China \u2019 s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region , with natural gas while the oil pipeline reaches as far as Kunming , Yunnan \u2019 s capital .\nHowever , construction of the pipeline aroused opposition inside Burma , since it involved the forcible relocation of people , especially in Rakhine and Shan State , caused environment pollution and will provide the government with as much as US $ 29.0 billion in royalties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seekins , 2017 : 148 , 149 ) .\nThe second project is the Letpadaung Copper Mine expansion , located in central Sagaing Region near the town of Monywa , which is a joint venture of the Myanmar Wanbao company , a subsidiary of China \u2019 s military-owned Norinco conglomerate , and Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings .\nIn November 2012 , after Thein Sein had assumed power and Aung San Suu Kyi had become a member of parliament , police attacked local people demonstrating against the mine , causing 67 injuries .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special government investigative committee , visited the site in March of the following year , telling the local people that they should stop their protests because Burma had to meet its contractual obligations with China .\nThis was the first sign of a new , \u201c pragmatic \u201d Suu Kyi .\nAlthough it affirmed her image in Chinese eyes as a credible partner in their economic schemes , it caused great disillusionment among her supporters who had thought of her as a fearless advocate of human rights and democracy : as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to eat was boiled rice when we supported you .\n.\n.\nBut you are not standing with us anymore \u201d ( Ibid.\n, 321 , 322 ) .\nHowever , the third project , the Myitsone Dam , located in northern Kachin State , was the most controversial Chinese project as well as the biggest investment approved by the SPDC , costing US $ 3.6 billion ( Sun Yun , 2012 : 58 ) .\nLike other projects , it was designed to provide China , rather than Burma , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Critics were appalled .\nThe dam would flood an area the size of Singapore , including four villages .\nNearly 12,000 people were being relocated .\nThe location of the dam , where two Himalayan rivers joined to form the Irrawaddy , was of considerable cultural importance to the Kachin people .\nActivists also drew attention to the massive environmental damage that could be caused to the Irrawaddy River itself , the lifeblood of the country .\nNo one knew exactly what was in the contract , but most believed the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been paid to army generals and their crony businessmen ( Thant Myint-U , 2020 : 145 , 146 ) .\nDuring the junta years , the Burmese people would have had to accept the dam project , no questions asked .\nBut under the liberalised administration of Thein Sein , a nationwide movement emerged to halt dam construction , including a petition sent to the government , \u201c From Those who wish the Irrawaddy to Flow Forever , \u201d signed by almost 1,600 influential figures in the country \u2019 s public life .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ : \u201c Stop the Myitsone Dam.\n\u201d Although he had mixed feelings about the dam and feared a negative reaction from China , in September 2011 Thein Sein decided that dam construction would be suspended , at least during the time he was in office ( Ibid. )\n.\nAlmost a decade later , work had not been restarted on the dam , not only because of popular opposition and ethnic insurgency but because southwestern China now had a surplus of electrical generating power .\nHowever , it has not been formally cancelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek a legal remedy from the Burmese government for investment money lost ( \u201c Selling the Silk Road Spirit , \u201d 2019 ) .\nThe Chinese government and business interests were shocked , especially since Thein Sein had not consulted them before suspending the project .\nRelations cooled , and the pace of Chinese investment slowed .\nBeijing was convinced that the improvement in Burma \u2019 s relations with western countries gave the Thein Sein government courage to say \u201c no \u201d to China , since capital from the West and Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other major projects , including the oil and gas pipeline , continued , and the attacks against the Rohingyas in northern Rakhine State carried out in 2017 by the Tatmadaw and local vigilantes , leading to over 700,000 of them fleeing to Bangladesh , aroused a firestorm of western criticism .\nThis was focused especially on Daw Suu Kyi , and led to targeted sanctions on some individuals , including commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing , who personally directed the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas ( Ibid. )\n.\nPredictably , Beijing offered support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suu Kyi as \u201c State Counsellor , \u201d and the turbulence in Burma-China relations transitioned into a new era of co-operation .\nOnce she entered into the political system with her election to a parliamentary seat in 2012 , Daw Suu Kyi proved to be almost flawlessly friendly to China \u2019 s interests .\nHer decision on the Letpadaung Copper Mine issue was a solid indication of this .\nAfter her National League for Democracy government was elected in a landslide in November 2015 , promising ( falsely , it turned out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and society , she and the Chinese leadership became something like a mutual admiration society .\nChina \u2019 s foreign minister Wang Yi went to Naypyidaw to congratulate her on her 2015 election victory the following year , the first foreign dignitary to do so , and Daw Suu Kyi herself went to Beijing to confer with Chinese president Xi Jinping .\nTheir meeting was warm , amply laced with language about Chinese and Burmese being pauk phaw , or \u201c distant cousins.\n\u201d Again , when Daw Suu Kyi was being bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , she was given moral support by Xi and other top Chinese officials during a December 2017 visit to Beijing .\nThe Chinese also assisted greatly in her ultimately fruitless efforts to achieve reconciliation with the ethnic armed organisations ( Thant Myint-U , 2020 : 228 , 247 ) .\nIn one of her \u201c Letters from Burma \u201d published in the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun in April 1996 , Daw Suu Kyi commented : To observe businessmen coming to Burma with the intention of enriching themselves is somewhat like watching passers-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their fragile beauty , blind to the ugliness of despoiled branches , oblivious of the fact that by their action they are imperiling future fruitfulness and committing an injustice against the rightful owners of the trees .\nAmong these despoilers are big Japanese companies .\n( Aung San Suu Kyi , 1996 : 3 ) .\nDaw Suu Kyi , who had spent a year as a researcher at Japan \u2019 s Kyoto University , was doubtlessly thinking of the Japanese springtime custom of viewing cherry blossoms when she wrote this .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2019 Burma \u2019 s democracy icon was walking firmly on pragmatism \u2019 s low road .\nBurma and the One Belt , One Road Initiative China \u2019 s President Xi Jinping announced his One Belt/One Road Initiative , BRI ( Chinese : \u4e00\u5e2f\u4e00\u8def ) in 2013 , an ambitious blueprint to use Chinese and international capital to construct economic linkages ( or \u201c corridors \u201d ) extending from China by land and sea to the western part of the Eurasian landmass .\nMajor BRI projects include : the China-Indochina Corridor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the China-Central Asia-West Asia Corridor , the China-Mongolia-Russia Corridor , the New Eurasia Landbridge , and the China-Myanmar Corridor ( also known as the China Myanmar Economic Corridor , or CMEC ) .\nWhile its goal is construction of transportation and communications infrastructure throughout Eurasia and beyond , stimulating the rapid growth of local industries and promoting growth , the scope of its ambition is perhaps best understood as covering an area larger than the 13th century Mongol Empire , which did not include South Asia or most of Southeast Asia .\nMany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects included within the BRI are members of Beijing \u2019 s new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank , set up as an alternative to the western and Japanese dominated World Bank ( \u201c Selling the Silk Road Spirit , \u201d 2019 ) .\nEssential to this vision is China \u2019 s hope to gain easy and stable access to the Indian Ocean through Burma and Pakistan ( although tensions between China and India and Vietnam may prevent implementation of corridors in the Subcontinent and Indochina ) .\nAccording to the Transnational Institute ( TNI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer size of the initiative \u2013 136 countries have received US $ 90 billion in Chinese foreign direct investment and exchanged US $ 6.0 trillion in trade with China \u2013 can make the BRI appear monolithic and inevitable \u201d ( Ibid. )\n.\nIn fact , it is more of a vision than a plan , and while it is legitimized by the central government in Beijing , it contains a large number of initiatives promoted by Chinese state-owned companies , provincial governments and private enterprise .\nIn other words , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is \u201c a broad framework of activities , rather than a predetermined plan \u201d ( Ibid. )\n.\nWhile politicians in Washington D.C. view the BRI as Beijing \u2019 s sinister plot to take over the world , or seduce developing countries into \u201c debt traps , \u201d the scheme is not centrally directed and , like other foreign investment schemes , extremely vulnerable to unstable conditions on the ground.9 Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative ( CC BY-SA 4.0 ) For a relatively poor country such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a huge deal .\nThe China Myanmar Economic Corridor ( CMEC ) was initiated in 2017 by Foreign Minister Wang Yi , following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) by the two governments .\nGiven that the major obstacle to Chinese investment in the country has been the continued civil war between the central government and ethnic armed organisations , the launching of the CMEC was accompanied by a renewed effort to carry out \u201c peace \u201d negotiations by Aung San Suu Kyi \u2019 s government .\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Pipeline already contributed to solidifying economic and infrastructure ties between the two countries , four projects were designated as priorities for furthering the BRI vision : \u2022 The North-South Energy Transmission Project , the integration of the electrical grids of China and Burma , which would impact ethnic minority regions such as Shan and Kachin States and could leave Burma dependent on China for electricity ; \u2022 A China-Burma High Speed Railway , connecting Yunnan Province with Burma , its Indian Ocean terminus being the Rakhine State port of Kyaukphyu ; \u2022 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge which would link Yunnan with the Indian Ocean in large measure through exploitation of the Irrawaddy River ; and , \u2022 Special Economic Zones ( SEZ ) and Industrial Zones , including the Kyaukphyu SEZ in Rakhine State ( \u201c Selling the Silk Road Spirit , 2019 \u201d ) .\nAnother important Chinese project is the \u201c New Yangon City Project , \u201d a ninety square kilometer new city to be constructed to the west of Rangoon ( Oo , 2021 ) .\nAlthough plans to construct an ultramodern \u201c new city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed soon after the 1988 SLORC takeover , none of these reached fruition , although the building of Naypyidaw as the new national capital could be considered an alternate scheme to insulate Burma \u2019 s elites and power-centre from popular unrest ( Seekins , 2019 : 81-106 ) .\nA Kachin political activist , Lahpai Seng Raw , has described the BRI from the perspective of vulnerable ethnic minorities : There is no doubt that a storm is brewing .\nCMEC is looming over us like a black , threatening mass of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unresolved political grievances and environmental degradation that envelop us .\nThis is the harsh reality that we Kachins face with the advent of CMEC .\nAnd , like it or not , we must face it and its resultant effects .\nAs things stand now , it would seem that we are caught between the devil and the deep sea , with not many good options in sight .\nThe question facing us now is whether it would be more pragmatic to cast our lot with China and its Belt Road Initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , and the non-negotiable , centralized \u201c Peace Process \u201d ?\n.\n.\n.\nAs it is , we do not have a choice of opting for the Devil or the Deep Blue Sea , but will have to face both of them head on ( Lahpai Seng Raw , 2019 ) .\nMany people who looked at Burma \u2019 s internal politics from an overly rational viewpoint were shocked by the February 1 coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat ( \u201c the generals already have it pretty good \u201d ) .\nPerhaps they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic legitimizing principle in the Tatmadaw \u2019 s political worldview , the difference between \u201c national politics \u201d and \u201c party politics \u201d : Under party politics , civilian politicians pursue diverse particular interests , while national politics is the supreme responsibility of the Tatmadaw as the protector and enforcer of national unity and identity , values which are viewed as constantly under assault from foreign countries ( Seekins , 2017 : 384 , 385 ) .\nThis doctrine was formulated in the early 1990s by pro-SLORC spokesmen , but continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s top brass in the third decade of the twenty-first century .\nSo seriously , in fact , that under their command the army and police have killed hundreds of peaceful and mostly unarmed protesters nationwide , with the violence continuing to escalate through March and April .\nIn a March 2021 interview with the National Committee on US-China Relations in Washington , broadcast on YouTube , analyst Sun Yun claimed that following the coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat , China sought to be \u201c neutral , \u201d observing the principle of non-interference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , proclaimed both by China and Burma .\nShe said that the principle \u201c ties China \u2019 s hands , \u201d although Beijing \u2019 s leaders really do not approve of the military takeover .\nShe also says that China values Burma more for its strategic location than its natural resources , given the BRI \u2019 s ambition to establish a land link between the interior of China and the Indian Ocean ( Sun Yun , 2021 ) .\nIn fact , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Republic of China has tended to observe this principle of non-interference in the breach when it had sufficiently compelling interests to do so : for example , it gave sanctuary to Burmese communist exiles during the 1950s and 1960s , armed and sent the People \u2019 s Army over the border in January 1968 and choose to support the SLORC/SPDC junta in 1988-2011 both militarily and economically , while largely keeping its distance from Aung San Suu Kyi and the pro-democratic opposition until after 2011 .\nAt the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Army in eastern Shan State , allowing it to establish an autonomous mini-state with a first-class armed force , sold weapons to several other ethnic armed organisations ( such as the Arakan Army ) and has exploited Burma \u2019 s natural resources , like jade , forests and natural gas , with little concern for the impacts , such as land grabbing , abuse of ethnic minorities and severe environmental pollution .\nSeeing Burma \u2019 s political stability as its top priority in bilateral relations , Beijing found a reliable partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Suu Kyi .\nIndeed , two weeks before the coup Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with her in Naypyidaw to sign agreements related to the China Myanmar Economic Corridor .\nAccording to a Thai diplomat , the closeness of Daw Suu Kyi to Beijing seems to have , in the words of one correspondent , \u201c hit a nerve with the military \u2019 s high command \u201d He went on to say that \u201c the military felt threatened by this \u201d ( Macan-Markar , 2021 ) .\nThe possibility that Burma will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn April 13 , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Michelle Bachelet , warned that the country could become another Syria , a battleground in which society collapses and refugees flee to other countries in huge numbers ( \u201c Myanmar heading toward \u2018 full blown conflict , \u2019 \u201d 2021 ) .\nWith the fatalities increasing at the hands of the Tatmadaw and police and the determination of ordinary Burmese people to regain at any cost the admittedly imperfect democracy that was stolen from them , there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although China , which first described the coup as a \u201c cabinet reshuffle , \u201d wants the crisis to simply go away , it won \u2019 t ( Lintner , 2021 ) .\nIt will get worse .\nAlready , Burmese people have expressed anti-Chinese sentiments , seeing Beijing as the enabler of the military regime and its violence .\nThousands of people in the streets of Rangoon , Mandalay and other cities have held up signs condemning China for condoning the coup and gathering at the Chinese embassy to protest ( \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-democracy supporters , \u201d 2021 ) .\nOn March 14 , fires were started in Chinese-owned factories in Hlaing Thayar , a township of Rangoon .\nAlthough there is suspicion that the fires might have been started by pro-regime agents provocateurs rather than protesters , Beijing predictably urged the regime to better protect its projects ( Oo , 2021 ; \u201c China again seeks Myanmar regime \u2019 s assurances on oil , gas pipeline security , \u201d 2021 ) .\nWith the anti-Chinese riots of June 1967 as a precedent , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of whose families have lived in the country since the colonial era , were targeted for attack .\nSeveral Burmese-Chinese people have been killed during the street protests , including a 19 year-old woman , Kyal Shin ( nicknamed \u201c Angel \u201d ) , who was shot dead in Mandalay on March 3rd .\nIn Rangoon , the Chinese community has stated publicly its support for the protests and denials that its members are loyal to the People \u2019 s Republic ( Lintner , 2021 ) .\nThe future for Burma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries including China seem unable or unwilling to intervene positively to help settle the crisis , and because as the Tatmadaw escalates its violence , the ordinary people increase their resistance .\nShould the violence continue , anti-regime citizens , possibly in alliance with ethnic armed organisations , are likely to turn to terrorist measures as a means of crippling the regime and its Chinese backers .\nLed by Aung San Suu Kyi , protests against the SLORC/SPDC during 1988-2010 were largely non-violent , but this could change , and the urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its citizens and projects , like the hugely vulnerable oil and gas pipelines , could be irresistible .\nIn such an eventuality , should China choose to downgrade its economic engagement or pull out of Burma entirely , it might turn to the China-Pakistan Corridor as a feasible alternative for gaining access to the Indian Ocean ( \u201c Selling the Silk Road Spirit , \u201d 2019 ) .\nSun Yun has commented that as of 2019 , the BRI connection with Pakistan had made considerable progress compared to the CMEC : President Xi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments of more than US $ 46.0 billion have already been signed ( Ibid. )\n.\nIn looking back on their two millennia of resistance against an expanding China , Vietnamese historians have often said that China has played a dual , ambiguous role in their country \u2019 s development : \u201c both our oppressor , and our teacher.\n\u201d In Burma , which engaged fully with China much more recently , it seems that despite deep suspicions of China held by some of the Tatmadaw \u2019 s top leaders , the Burmese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s northern neighbour to \u201c pacify \u201d the country in a vain search for stability .\nGiven this situation , the famous comment of the Roman historian Tacitus on the Roman occupation of Britain seems appropriate : \u201c they have made a desert , and call it peace.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the

Islamabad has already tacitly granted basing rights to the US military for counterterrorism operations .\nMilitary analysts say that the Jacobabad base in Sindh province , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and

\u201d he said .\nIn the same breath , Mckenzie also hinted at \u201c working with nations surrounding Afghanistan to base troops and aircraft for countering terrorists after the US pullout.\n@ @ @ @

suspected of carrying beef in their tiffin boxes .\nIn 1984 , the Congress government ordered the military attack on the Golden Temple complex , the holiest shrine of the Sikhs in Amritsar , to deal with a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result of this ill-conceived army operation , many innocent pilgrims died , and Sikhs were outraged all across the world .\nThis was done to humiliate the Sikh minority to win an upcoming election .\nOn October 31 , 1984 , the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was murdered by her Sikh bodyguards .\nThe Congress then organized anti-Sikh massacres all over India .\nSeveral BJP/RSS men also participated in the violence .\nIn the ensuing election , Indira \u2019 s son got a huge majority in parliament , while BJP only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the BJP-RSS vote had shifted to the Congress .\nModi used similar tactics in 2002 when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat .\nFollowing a fire on a train carrying Hindu pilgrims , anti-Muslim pogroms were organized all over Gujarat under Modi \u2019 s watch , after he had blamed the incident on Muslims .\nWhile Modi was never charged , the survivors and the witnesses continue to allege his complicity .\nHe was denied visa by the US and other western countries until he became the Prime Minister in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLet \u2019 s fast forward to his re-election in 2019 .\nShortly after his second term began , his government started pushing the core RSS agenda more aggressively .\nAs part of its long term commitment to the Hindu Right , his government scrapped the special status given to Kashmir , the only Muslim majority state in India .\nThousands of Kashmiris fighting for self-determination were detained .\nThen came the famous temple verdict .\nThe Indian Supreme Court handed over the disputed site of Ayodhya to the Hindus .\nAyodhya is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent Hindu god .\nThe BJP has always claimed that the Muslim rulers had demolished the Ram temple that once stood there , to build a mosque .\nIn 1992 , the BJP goons had razed the mosque .\nSince then the BJP has been campaigning to rebuild a Hindu temple at the exact spot .\nIt is widely believed that the Supreme Court favoured the ruling BJP , and now Modi is determined to deliver on his promise to implement the RSS agenda of rebuilding the Ram temple .\nHis government went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was a highly discriminatory legislation that welcomes only non-Muslim refugees coming to India from the three neighbouring Muslim-dominated countries , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Afghanistan .\nIf all this wasn \u2019 t enough , the BJP government passed agriculture laws that the farming community believes will harm their livelihood .\nAll these laws were implemented without much debate in parliament , merely because the BJP has an absolute majority in the house .\nAnyone resisting these policies can be potentially charged and detained under draconian laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lapdog media of Modi \u2019 s government .\nThe situation continues to deteriorate .\nSo much so , even those who raise questions over the government \u2019 s mismanagement of the COVID 19 situation must face the music .\nDespite tall claims of development and progress , India has failed under Modi .\nThe shortage of oxygen and beds in the hospitals suggests the complete lack of preparedness .\nTo question that makes you an \u201c anti-national \u201d or \u201c unpatriotic \u201d .\nWe can see clearly how the space for democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe previous regimes definitely played a role for the current state of affairs , by pandering to the Hindu majority and not doing enough to bring an even economic growth , but this government must take blame for outright failure , as they have a majority in the house .\nIf this government can implement core programs of the RSS , why can \u2019 t it deliver on issues that matter to everyone ?\nThat the majority is with Modi is mainly because the RSS has been actively mobilizing people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .\nNot only the previous regimes failed to stop the RSS from marching ahead , they have been pandering Hindu majority by playing destructive and competitive politics only to the benefit of Modi .\nToday , the RSS has deeply penetrated into the Indian institutions , the academic bodies , the administrative structure and even the police and the intelligence .\nLet \u2019 s examine what is means for Canada and the rest of the world ?\nWhatever is happening in India , will definitely have ripple effects here .\nWe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombings ; the worst terror incident in Canadian history .\nNever forget that it was the culmination of the ugly events of 1984 .\nThe Canada-based Sikh separatists are widely blamed for the incident that claimed 331 lives .\nAre we waiting for another tragedy ?\nIt is important to pay attention .\nThe way Modi is treating minorities might have an impact in the Indian Diaspora .\nHis supporters are increasingly becoming vocal and aggressive in Canada , inciting his opponents here , while most Canadians still take India \u2019 s secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , Modi \u2019 s policy of assimilating Sikhs should be recognized as a huge problem .\nMuch as First Nations here are resisting assimilation , the Sikhs , who have a sizable population in Canada and have been defending their separate identity , are anxious about the continued growth of the RSS .\nNotably , the RSS is repeating the history of Indian Residential Schools .\nThey have been plucking young Indigenous or Adivasi girls from the north-eastern states , sending them to seminaries far away from their families to be indoctrinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The CAA is also a repetition of the Continuous Journey Regulation ( CJR ) , under which the Komagata Maru ship was forcibly returned from Vancouver in 1914 .\nWhereas the CJR was aimed to keep Indian immigrants away , the CAA discriminates against Muslim refugees .\nThe RSS believes in the brutal caste system within Hindu society .\nMuch like blacks , who suffer systemic racism here in North America , the Dalits or so-called untouchables face worst discrimination under that system .\nFor RSS the idea of racial superiority was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler , the BJP supporters openly admired Donald Trump .\nModi campaigned shamelessly for his re-election .\nLet \u2019 s keep in mind though , that Modi and RSS are far more dangerous than Trump .\nAs we see anti-Asian racism growing here in North America due to COVID 19 , in other parts of India people from north eastern states with oriental facial features are also facing discrimination under Modi \u2019 s watch .\nDue to his anti-China rhetoric , this hate has grown even more .\nIt is time for Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously .\nCanada , which is also enamoured by Sikh politics , failed to see the gradual growth of RSS in this country .\nWhat is the reason that Canada has failed to ban any Hindu extremist group ?\nIt is well known how the Hindu Right mobilized people in Canada in support of the Ram temple movement .\nSome temples even here in BC supported the idea of rebuilding the Ram temple in Ayodhya .\nThose associated with the movement and were responsible for the demolition of the Ayodhya mosque in 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple congregations .\nSome of these temples have been holding RSS drills , and some RSS men held positions of power in local temples , and yet the Canadian authorities looked away .\nIndia and Canada have had a number of strategies to deal with the Sikh separatists , but there is a complete silence about growing Hindu extremism .\nOnly recently , when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau raised his concern over the mistreatment of agitating farmers , there was a fierce backlash from India .\nShortly after that , Trudeau asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which further emboldened RSS sympathizers in Canada and encouraged them to hold demonstrations to irritate Modi critics here .\nWhile Canada had opened its doors for Hindus and Sikhs facing religious persecution in Afghanistan , and for a Christian woman who faced death in Pakistan , there has been a deafening silence over what is happening with minorities in India .\nCanada recently recognized genocide of Uyghur Muslims in China , but failed to recognize genocides of Sikhs and Muslims in India , which only reflects its selectivity .\nEven though the Sikh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada is still keeping an eye on Sikh activists , although it should be keeping a watch on Hindu groups .\nWhat needs to be done ?\nThere is a need to keep a check on the RSS and its folks in Canada , besides banning their activities .\nThis should be followed by a freeze on their assets to stop hate funding .\nEqually important is to identify the organizations that have sympathy for RSS and Modi , but operate under the disguise of pro-India lobby groups .\nThere is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents all across Canada , who have been trying to influence our politicians and the ethnic media to create a favourable image of Modi and the RSS .\nElected officials who openly sympathize with Modi and RSS and continue to overlook their crimes against humanity must be made accountable .\nIf Canada really is a human rights leader in the world , it needs to stand up for the human rights of minorities in India under Modi .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog

position , the country needs six new submarines to counter the growing strength of the Chinese fleet that has long housed warships across the Indian Ocean .\nCurrently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one leased from Russia and the other domestically built .\nChina has seven nuclear submarines and will soon add 12 more .\nIt is obvious that New Delhi wants to narrow the ever-increasing gap in military power between the two countries .\nAlso noted is the Indian military base on North Agal\u00e9ga Island , part of Mauritius , an island nation in the Indian Ocean to the east of Madagascar .\nThis military base is taking on a so-called defensive role against China \u2019 s growing power , particularly in Eastern Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established in 2015 to track Chinese ships passing through the Indian Ocean to the African coast .\nUsing the base for this purpose against China demonstrates that India is increasingly aligning its international policy with QUAD ( Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ) , an anti-China U.S.-led organization that also consists of Japan and Australia .\nNew Delhi has traditionally kept its distance from military alliances , and yet , although today QUAD is not an officially institutionalized organization , many believe it will soon become a kind of \u201c Asian NATO.\n\u201d This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional position as a leading voice of the Non-Aligned

Australia .\nMice have moved to the front of the queue in terms of animal species Australians would most like to liquidate .\nThe language used has various registers : sombre and regretful ; grave and scientific ; panicked and bloody .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterised by ignoring the anthropogenic nature of the problems .\nBehind every pest outbreak on the Australian continent is a human hand operated by a muddled mind .\nIn Australia , that hand has been particularly busy in negligence .\nSince the eighteenth century , animal species have been introduced inadvertently or through design affecting and in many instances devastating the continent \u2019 s ecosystem .\nSome have been introduced with the purpose of neutralising other designated pest species , the most calamitous example being that of the cane toad .\nIntroduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experiment Stations in 1935 , the toad \u2019 s intended target were scarab beetles whose root-feeding larvae delighted in commercial agriculture , notably sugarcane crops .\nFamously , the toad preferred different sources of food and proceeded to prey on other species with gusto , including native predators .\nThe species flourished .\nThe humble house mouse is said to have arrived with the British First Fleet in 1788 but some speculation abounds that the introduction might have come via Dutch ships charting the coast of \u201c New Holland \u201d in the 1600s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that \u201c a British Isles origin of Australian mice is the most reasonable interpretation of our results.\n\u201d Mice populations have recently soared , notably in New South Wales and southern Queensland , given drought breaking rains .\nCrops have been attacked and animal food reserves contaminated .\nThere have been instances of infection , notably leptospirosis .\nAs Danica Leys of the Association of Rural Women sees it , \u201c It is an economic and health crisis .\nFrom the contamination of food and water by mice , to the diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than crops , not to mention the stress it causes \u201d .\nThe rise in numbers has made an impression on foreign press outlets .\nThe London-based Express wrote of an infestation of tens of millions of mice .\nAustralians had \u201c reported the mice terrorising their lives , creeping over their faces as they sleep , biting them , invading classrooms and even nibbling at patients in their hospital beds.\n\u201d It did not take long for these militant rodents to be seen as a threat to Australia \u2019 s most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had warned about a potential mice \u201c march \u201d .\nThe hearty solution , as always with the next pest , is mass extermination .\nAustralia \u2019 s deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack expressed the widely held view that , \u201c The only good mouse is a dead mouse.\n\u201d To that end there is seemingly no end to the devilish applications of human ingenuity in destroying or regulating a species .\nModern mice killers try to sound like educated middle managers , flirting with scientific rationalist inquiry .\nCan we be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nTake , for instance , the next generation of \u201c gene driven \u201d technology , with the New South Wales government promising AU $ 1.8 million for the venture .\n( The total mouse control package comes to AU $ 50 million . )\nThe most important feature of this technology is inducing infertility , a soft , tender gloved version of dispatch .\nThis form of extermination is clean , avoids killing other species on route , and sits well with the bio-controllers .\n\u201c We have modelled it already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide states , \u201c and it should cause the population to crash over time.\n\u201d Thomas is also delighted by the \u201c X-shredder \u201d approach , which involves targeting the X chromosome carrier , namely , the sperm of the mice .\nYou might be forgiven for thinking that a daring experiment for the betterment of humanity was in the offing .\n\u201c Mice arrived in Australia with the first fleet , \u201d trumpeted the NSW Minister for Agriculture Adam Marshall , \u201c and from then until now the best control methods we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been baiting and trapping.\n\u201d The less modern aspect of this inspired strategy is the use of a particular poison , bromadiolone , which has been likened by Marshall to the use of \u201c napalm \u201d .\n( Should we be worried ? )\nThe factsheet of the National Pesticide Pest Centre is cheery about its effects .\n\u201c Unlike some other rat poisons , which require multiple days of feeding by an animal , bromadiolone can be lethal from one day \u2019 s feeding.\n\u201d With such sinister war metaphors involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was going too far .\nSpecies murder is acceptable , but , as with some genocidaire types , it comes with ceremonial restraint .\nKilling mice with such poison would insert the substance into the food chain , endangering predators .\nPeter Brown , who heads the rodent management research team at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) , notes that \u201c anti-coagulants can accumulate up through the food chain , and so birds of prey or other animals can be feeding on dead mice and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through secondary poisoning.\n\u201d Evidence of bird deaths arising from the ingestion of poisoned bait has already been found in the central west of NSW .\nAnd that \u2019 s in connection with the less toxic and commonly used zinc phosphide .\nKelly Lacey , a volunteer for the NSW Wildlife Information , Rescue and Education Services ( WIRES ) , found 100 dead galahs in a cemetery in Parkes at the end of last month .\nIt was particularly galling for her , seeing as she had been involved in rehabilitating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the area .\nBait poisonings of household pets and working animals have also been recorded .\nPeter Best , a veterinarian based in South Tamworth , estimated that one in 15 admissions to his practice had involved poisoned animals .\nSuch facts could only make another researcher at the CSIRO sigh .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s used properly , \u201d observed Steve Henry , \u201c it should be a very , very low risk that a bird should find one of those grains of zinc phosphide and eat it.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be said for those using it .\n\u201c Why birds start falling out of the sky is [ that ] people do inappropriate things.\n\u201d Such people used the bait in ways \u201c not described on the label , or people make up their own baits.\n\u201d When asked about her attitude to the problem , Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor Melissa Gray suggested , with no detectable irony , that everybody wanted \u201c the mouse plague gone , but there \u2019 s no silver bullet.\n\u201d No silver bullets , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extermination .\nFor the president of the NSW Farmers Association , the mayhem caused by such a poison as bromadiolone was worth the effort .\nShowing the somewhat patchy wisdom of his forebears , he accepted the lethal calculus .\n\u201c It will cause poisoning in animals that eat the dead mice \u201d .\nThat , however , \u201c was the lesser of two evils \u201d .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog site ,

will begin retiring coal-fired power plants for good \u2014 while still continuing to build more than a hundred new ones , in the latest mixed message from one of the last coal-friendly countries in the world .\nPLN , the state-owned power utility , which has a monopoly on the national grid , announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon coal by 2055 .\n\u201c We are scheduling the retirement of our coal-fired power plants to achieve carbon neutrality in 2060 , \u201d PLN deputy CEO Darmawan Prasodjo said in an online event May 28 .\nHe said the retirement plan is a directive from President Joko Widodo and has been agreed on by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources as well as the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment .\n\u201c This is a battle that we can \u2019 t lose , \u201d Darmawan said .\n\u201c The survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are taking today.\n\u201d A day earlier , Luhut Pandjaitan , the coordinating minister for investments , had declared fossil fuels a global \u201c common enemy \u201d during an online investment forum .\nLuhut himself maintains a stake in a coal mining company .\nIn the first stage of its plan , PLN says it will retire three coal and gasified-coal power plants , with a combined capacity of 1.1 gigawatts , by 2030 .\nIn the next stage , from 2030 to 2055 , it will retire 49 GW of coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the utility and the various independent power producers it works with are still on track to build 117 new coal fired-power plants .\nAs of 2020 , there were 11.8 GW of coal plants under construction in the country , according to a 2020 report by EndCoal .\nThat \u2019 s part of the total 21 GW of coal capacity still to come online , which includes planned plants for which financing has been secured , according to PLN \u2019 s Darmawan .\nThese new plants will churn out 107 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Andri Prasetiyo , a researcher at Trend Asia , an NGO that focuses on clean energy transition .\nAnd with plants typically operating for 35 to 40 years , it \u2019 s likely Indonesia will still have a large fleet of coal plants running in 2060 or even 2065 , despite what PLN says .\n\u201c Meanwhile , coal-fired power plants have to totally cease to operate by 2050 in order to achieve the global target of net-zero emissions to tackle the climate crisis , \u201d Andri said .\nThese new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder for renewables to compete with coal , according to Tata Mustasya , climate and energy campaign coordinator at Greenpeace Indonesia .\nCoal accounts for 60 % of Indonesia \u2019 s energy mix , compared to less than 1 % for solar and wind combined .\nTata called the plan to phase out coal plants while still building new ones \u201c a contradiction , \u201d as it will effectively eliminate the space for renewable energy in the next three to four decades .\nOn its own , however , the announcement by PLN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been campaigning for Indonesia to transition to clean and renewable energy for years \u2014 to no avail \u2014 off guard .\n\u201c We are surprised , \u201d Pamela Simamora , a research coordinator at the Institute for Essential Services Reform ( IESR ) , a Jakarta-based think tank , told Mongabay .\nShe called the move a dramatic shift in the government \u2019 s energy policy , which has long been characterized by an overreliance on coal and generous subsidies for miners and power plant operators .\n\u201c It \u2019 s true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks a 180-degree turn [ on energy policy ] , \u201d Pamela said .\n\u201c This is thanks to the international community , which has also pushed the government [ to phase out coal ] .\nIndonesia might be afraid to be branded as not ambitious enough and to not have commitment for [ tackling ] climate change.\n\u201d Adhityani Putri , executive director of Cerah , a local advocacy group pushing for a clean energy transition , said the sudden change might come from growing awareness that it doesn \u2019 t make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry like coal , which international investors are increasingly shunning .\n\u201c The dramatic change of political narrative is really brought about by the realization that fossil fuel financing , especially for coal power plants as well as financing for coal mining , is quickly drying up , \u201d Adhityani said as quoted by Bloomberg .\n\u201c All this pressure leveled against coal is starting to be felt within elite circles.\n\u201d The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the decline of the coal industry , with the crisis showing that renewable energy is cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors .\nRecently , the G7 group of richest countries , including the U.S. and Japan , agreed to stop international financing of coal projects by the end of 2021 .\nAnd South Korea , one of the biggest funders of coal power plants in Indonesia , is pulling out of the business as well .\nPamela called the shift by PLN \u201c a breath of fresh air , \u201d but said the rhetoric should be backed by meaningful action .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not enough for investors .\nWhat they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh air doesn \u2019 t always last long , \u201d she said .\nThat means legislating the new policy of a clean energy transition into law , given that the government still doesn \u2019 t have a unified , definitive stance on the matter , with opinions differing among officials and agencies , Pamela said .\n\u201c There are differences in [ official ] road maps and statements .\nThis creates confusion for us who work in the sector , and for the public : which one should we follow ?\n\u201d she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Luhut , the coordinating minister for investments , has branded fossil fuels a \u201c common enemy , \u201d the assistant deputy for energy in his ministry , Rida Yasser , has tempered calls for a complete coal phase-out .\nHe said not all coal-fired power plants would need to be shut down to achieve net-zero carbon emissions .\n\u201c Yes , we need to phase out coal , but our target is net-zero [ emissions ] , not zero emissions , \u201d he said in the May 28 event alongside PLN \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net-zero is achieved , why do we need to throw away our investments [ in coal plants ] that haven \u2019 t seen a return yet ?\n\u201d Rida said said shutting down plants before recouping their cost would be a waste of money if net-zero emissions are already achieved .\nPamela said this kind of thinking fails to see that phasing out coal is not just an environmental issue , but also an economic issue .\nIndonesia \u2019 s continued use of coal could see its other exports to the European Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax , for instance , Pamela said .\nThe scheme , which the EU is still considering , would levy a tax on the carbon emissions associated with imported goods .\n\u201c So our products will be more expensive and less competitive , \u201d Pamela said .\n\u201c And renewables will become much cheaper than coal .\nAs a result , our energy subsidy will balloon and our production will have the highest cost because the energy [ in our country ] is more expensive .\nSo it \u2019 s not only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd this is not emphasized enough.\n\u201d The Cilacap coal power plant is located near a port for local fishermen .\nImage by Tommy Apriando/Mongabay-Indonesia .\nThere \u2019 s also no consensus from the government on the deadline for Indonesia to achieve carbon neutrality .\nWhile Indonesia \u2019 s environment ministry says 2070 is the most realistic scenario for net-zero emissions , the country \u2019 s development planning ministry , Bappenas , says that if Indonesia can achieve the goal sooner , by 2045 or 2050 , the country would reap economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ externalities .\nLuhut has also said Indonesia should aim for an earlier deadline , possibly 2050 .\nCentral to this lack of a unified message from the government is the fact that President Joko Widodo hasn \u2019 t spoken publicly on the matter , according to Pamela .\nDuring an online global leaders \u2019 summit in April hosted by U.S. President Joe Biden , Widodo notably didn \u2019 t give a date for Indonesia \u2019 s net-zero goals \u2014 even as his Brazilian counterpart , Jair Bolsonaro , notorious for his anti-environment rhetoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare Brazil is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 .\n\u201c That \u2019 s what \u2019 s important for the president to do , to give a public statement on the deadline and time frame , \u201d Pamela said .\n\u201c So when there \u2019 s a clear voice from the highest office , the policies at the lower levels can be synchronized.\n\u201d She said the transition away from coal and other fossil fuels is inevitable .\n\u201c The world has been moving toward a low-carbon economy , \u201d she said .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , we have to embrace it .\nChanges will certainly come.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @

is noteworthy that China , which invests billions of dollars in the Pakistani economy , is not participating in the new gas project .\nSince the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1951 , China and Pakistan have been linked by comprehensive cooperation , the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) , which is part of China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative .\nThe Chinese media points that since its official launch in April 2015 , the CPEC has become one of the most popular projects of The Belt and Road Initiative , and Pakistan immediately received an investment of $ 25 billion from China .\nAs for China \u2019 s non-participation in the construction of Pakistan Stream Gas Pipeline , this can be explained quite simply by its lack of experience and technology required to implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the construction of the gas pipeline due to the fact that Pakistan \u2019 s gas consumption in 2020 has already passed the mark of 47 billion cubic meters , although in 2001 the country consumed a modest 19 billion cubic meters .\nIt is expected that by the early 2030s , Pakistan \u2019 s gas market deficit will reach an astronomical figure of 40 billion cubic meters of gas per year .\nThis rapid growth in natural gas consumption is due not only to the country \u2019 s growing population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urbanization and the rapid development of national industry .\nHowever , Pakistan has extremely limited reserves of oil , gas , and coal , so the only way out of this situation is the ever-increasing import of energy .\nIn addition , it should not be overlooked that Pakistan has consistently developed automobile transport with a focus on the use of natural gas , and the share of such vehicles in the country is now nearly 70 % , which is the second highest in the world .\nHowever , the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports is complicated for Pakistan by issues of interaction with its closest neighbors \u2013 primarily with India and Afghanistan .\nIn this situation , LNG imports via offshore terminals have become almost the only way for Pakistan to rapidly increase its energy consumption , and the Russian proposal to build a modern pipeline was expected to be in line with the development of Pakistan \u2019 s gas industry .\nAgainst the background of anti-Russian sanctions imposed by the US against the Nord Stream-2 pipeline , the signing of the contract to build and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible recognition of Russia \u2019 s success in high technology fields of the gas industry and a vivid response to the sanctions policy of the U.S. and some of its Western European allies .\nTherefore , Pakistan Stream Gas Pipeline , associated with the LNG import terminal , is not just another foreign project of Russia , but a promising model of future export sales of Russian gas , despite Washington \u2019 s intensified attempts to prevent it .\nNote to readers : Please click the share

replaced North Korean \u201c ghost ships \u201d in international discourse as symbolic of a certain form of global maritime threat and disturbance .\nThis article takes a longer view of trouble on the high seas , looking back to the globalization of the oceanic commons at the behest of post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fisheries science .\nWith Carmel Finley \u2019 s articulation of Pacific Empires of Fishing in mind the article explores fishing histories of East Asia and the Pacific , both during and after the era of colonization The article considers the marginalization of already peripheral traditional Korean fishing communities by Japanese colonization , ecological collapse generated by the technological and statistical development underpinning scientific fishing , and the ghosts made of fish themselves as the powers and logics of accumulation and extraction transform the watery geographies of the Pacific .\nIn 2020 many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into reverse or halt uncomfortably , as that most global of forces , a worldwide pandemic , ravaged international travel and the connections through which intercontinental trade and travel have become so normalized in recent decades .\nAs the airport lounges emptied and the stratospheric sinews that stretch across the planet became ever thinner and more tenuous , it was as if we had returned , apart from the ever present and very global virus , to the world of our grandparents and great-grandparents where nations such as Australia and South Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very distant , very much over there or down there , half known about and seldom visited .\nJust as these more familiar and practically useful products of globalization receded , so alongside the virus , and perhaps because of the disconnection brought by this extraordinary year , other seemingly uncontrolled globalizing energies began to disturb and dismay popular and political media .\nA particularly widely spread academic article published in July 2020 raised the issue of Chinese \u201c dark fleets \u201d of fishing boats,1which had come to dominate many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea ( North Korean boats perhaps displaced or reduced due to Covid19-related epidemic restrictions which saw most of its fleet restricted to port ) .\nLater in the year the \u201c dark fleets \u201d were reported just outside the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Galapagos Islands ( sovereign to Ecuador ) , and further reports suggested that they had created ecological pressure on waters off West Africa ( displacing of course the very public fleets from European Union nations which had previously exploited these same waters ) .\nSuch masses of fishing boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in global discourse .\nDark in the literal sense that they are generally invisible to the normal monitoring technologies important to contemporary global fishing ( they switch their AIS transponders off or do not have them fitted in the first place ) .\nBut Dark also in the conceptual sense that they are regarded as nefarious and evil in intent , another long arm of the autocratic People \u2019 s Republic of China ( PRC ) with which it shamelessly and brutally seeks to strip resources without limit from the global commons .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boats in North Korean Waters , 2019 \u2013 Image in supplementary materials for \u2018 Jaeyoon Park et al .\n2020 .\n\u201c Illuminating Dark Fishing

avoidance of the regularized monitoring systems prevalent across the globe , but they are not really unique in their ecological impact or in their presence in the Pacific .\nIndustrial fishing since the 1950s has seen something of a developmental and technological arms race across the planet that has stripped the oceans of life and abundance , fishing down trophic levels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never previously have been considered worth catching , and radically altering the topography of the deep sea , transforming sea floors across the planet into flat , featureless deserts marked by the drag lines of trawler gear .\nThe PRC is late to the enterprise , as fleets from the European Union , the United States , Japan , and the former Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations prior to 1992 , ranged across the globe .\nThey are perhaps brazen in their efforts , which resemble a form of poaching on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced the previous fleets of concern regionally , namely those North Korean \u201c ghost ships \u201d which began to appear after 2012 ( Winstanley-Chesters 2020 ) .2 These forlorn , old fashioned and decrepit boats which washed up hundreds of times on the coasts of northern Japan and the Russian Federation , sometimes with cargoes of deceased North Koreans , were themselves the offspring of poaching fleets in the West Sea/Sea of Japan exploiting the rare rainbow squid populations on and around the Yamato Bank and competing uncomfortably with technologically advanced Japanese squid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as visible in the media as the Chinese from 2020 , and aside from the impact of the occasional dead crew members on the Japanese and Russian coast , were almost as impactful when it comes to poaching and illicit extraction from the commons .\nThere was huge concern about North Korea \u2019 s monetization of potential maritime resources and what that might have meant for the support given to its military capacity and capability , as well as the breaking of the sanctions regime led by the United States designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also some concern that North Korean institutional pressure on non-fishing coastal communities , given the other pressures on its economy and government , was pushing people who weren \u2019 t actually fishermen to sea , endangering them and leading to those unfortunate situations which resulted in some boats becoming \u201c ghost ships.\n\u201d The Russian Federation in particular was most upset by the damage caused by North Korean fleets to the delicate conservational balance off the shores of Primorsky , particularly the Pacific Salmon which return to spawn in its far eastern rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of East Asian and Korean maritime interactions .\nWe also take a longer view of the impact of internationalization and globalization on fishing and marine matters .\nWhereas globalization is generally considered a product of the WTO and GATT agendas , post-Cold War deregulation , financialization and neo-liberalism , when it comes to the extraction of value from under the waves and the exchange of products from the sea , global interactions have long been the reality .\nExtending a nation \u2019 s fishing capabilities and capacities across the globe , essentially an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twentieth century , was injected with a new sense of urgency after the end of Second World War .\nIn the Pacific the late 1940s and 1950 \u2019 s was an era of technological development and international competition in what was considered a global commons by the United States , Japan and other postwar allies on the one hand , and the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations on the other .\nAfter 1960 nations sought to claim sovereignty once again over waters closer to them , a trend which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile EEZ \u2019 s ( Exclusive Economic Zones ) , but this did not reverse the pressure and urgency on countries participating in global fishing efforts .\nKorean interactions with the sea are , like most elements of the peninsula \u2019 s history , unnavigable and incomplete if its pre-modern and colonial histories are not examined .\nKorea \u2019 s watery history does of course not simply start in 1945 , and neither does the history of Pacific fishing and maritime endeavor .\nThe desire to extract and accumulate wealth and value from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean floors of the Pacific as the reader will see , may have dramatically expanded in the second half of the twentieth century at the behest of capital , the United States and its former enemy Japan , but fishing has a longer history and the former Japanese Empire and territories such as the Korean peninsula were testbeds and nurseries for many of the techniques and technologies that would later be familiar in the practice of industrial fishing .\nWatery and Fishy Histories of the Korean Peninsula Fishing and coastal development on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex religious and cultural histories .\nBuddhist practices integrated into Korean society during the Kogury\u014f ( \uace0\uad6c\ub824 ) ( 37 BCE \u2013 688 CE ) and Kory\u014f ( \uace0\ub824 ) ( 918 CE \u2013 1392 CE ) eras meant that , as was the case in Japan ( as Jakobina Arch found with the transformation of wild boar into \u201c mountain whales \u201d 3 ) , eating animal flesh and animal products became highly problematic .\nBecause of the stipulations of Seon Buddhist theology ( in which Korea \u2019 s Jogye Order ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the killing of fish and other marine life became entirely forbidden , seen as an act of blasphemy against the Buddha .\nWhen Kory\u014f was replaced by Chos\u014fn and the Yi dynasty in 1392 , Buddhism declined in institutional influence , replaced by what came to be a very distinct approach to Confucianism and later Neo-Confucianism .\nNeo-Confucianism was very tightly focused on social ordering and complex organization of state ritual which included a restrictive class based system.4 Fishing as a tradition that involved the killing and preparation of fish never rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less problematic at various moments during the history of Chos\u014fn.At times fishermen or gatherers of products from the sea were counted in the Sangmin , ( \uc0c1\ubbfc ) ( common people ) and sometimes within the Ch \u2019 \u014fnmin ( \ucc9c\ubbfc ) ( vulgar common people ) class .\nThose that actually killed and prepared fish products or took shellfish and prepared them however found themselves in the Paekch\u014fng ( \ubc31\uc815 ) ( untouchables or unclean ) class .\nThus contact or relationships with fishing people for people in other , higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or enterprise with them , was further complicated by social strictures.5 This meant that fishing communities were often at some distance or remove from other villages and towns in historical Korea and they were extremely low down the list of institutional priorities for the institutions of Chos\u014fn .\nThere is one further element of spiritual practice which impacted on Korean fishing communities .\nWhile both Buddhism and Confucianism established rigorous frameworks for religious and cultural practice on the peninsula , they did not entirely replace earlier animist and geomantic traditions.6 Given Korea \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed , perhaps influenced by similar development in what would become China .\nSuch geomancy remains influential in Korean culture , known through notions such as Paektutaegan/Baekdudaegan ( \ubc31\ub450\ub300\uac04 ) , in which spiritual energy is seen as flowing through the Korean peninsula using the mountain ranges as networks and conduits,7 and mountain spirits , Sanshin/Sansin ( \uc0b0\uc2e0 ) , who embody the spirit and the physicality of mountains.8 Geomancy does not revolve entirely around mountains , and it would be surprising if similar traditions had not developed at the coast or beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual traditions , as with Chinese , the sea , its coasts and waters were the domain of one of the Sea Dragon Kings .\nWhile in China these latter served as both water and weather gods , connecting to the points of the compass in a variety of traditions , in Korean coastal traditions they become unified as a single King.9 This spiritual vision of watery geomancy has the waters not as a place of control , but of dangerous chaos .\nThus Korean coastal communities and by extension the peninsula \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , which needed placating.10 Before the modern and colonial periods , this placating was done by a highly complex , but little researched , network of ritual and practice which is very rarely glimpsed in the contemporary era .\nJust as in the mountains , communities would visit and intercede with Sanshin at Sanshingak , coastal and fishing communities would have Sea Dragon King temples and visit auspicious places along the coast where spiritual energy resided.11 This often meant that particular coastal rocks or islets were extremely significant , that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be visited or only visited at certain times .\nIt also meant that Korean traditional fishing boats were organized in particular formats and decorated with shamanic signs and charms and that their sails were as much for coordinating spiritual messages as they were for catching the wind.12 Beyond the complexity of the nexus of purely spiritual or cultural matters and development , observers/scholars must also contend with the extreme reluctance of the Chos\u014fn government to develop what might be called conventional mercantilism in Korea .\nThis difficulty with economic development and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or extraction , ( such as fishermen ) is also demonstrated by the restrictive and exploitative system developed of commission tradesmen and bond holders , who financially complicated the daily and yearly life of fishing communities , the Kaekchu .\nImage 3 : Sea Dragon King painting in harbor shrine at Gageodo Island , South Korea \u2013 Image taken by author , 22nd June , 2017 .\nFishing and colonization in the Pacific The Korean fishing communities and Korean maritime culture in the 19th century was impacted by the new forces of capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of a special case in Asian fishing , given that Japan colonized Korea and neither country was colonized by a European or American power .\nThe impositions of extra-territoriality during the treaty port era heavily impacted on China \u2019 s extensive maritime cultures , western powers setting up new institutions and enterprises all along its coast .\nWhile the Dutch had long been engaged in connection with South Asian territories and developmental communities , for the most part these had involved spices and materials from the land.13 Fish and products of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade across great distances but by the 19th century steam ships and refrigeration promised real changes to potential maritime economies .\nSuch changes came first to Japan whose economy and political structures had been forced open by the powers of colonialism and upended in the turmoil of the Meiji restoration ( \u660e\u6cbb\u7dad\u65b0 ) .\nThe Sakoku \u9396\u56fd ( closed country ) restrictions ( instigated after 1639 ) , were quickly lifted and in 1867 stipulations on the size of Japanese ships , and whether they could go beyond the coast into the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another two decades before extensive change occurred as Japan \u2019 s population was still too small due to Tokugawa policies and cultural traditions surrounding abortion and infanticide which allowed poor families to deliberately keep their families small , To support an extensive fishing industry and the local class system in which fishing people had low status ( though not as low as in Korea ) , meant that when the class system was finally abolished in 1870 many fishing people partially abandoned the sea to work in agricultural settings.14 However improved technology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distance meant that in-shore fishing began to place an impractical burden on fish stocks and catches actually began to decline.15 Accordingly , in 1887 , the government of Japan \u2019 s first modern Prime Minister , Ito Hirobumi , instituted legislation which sought to encourage deep sea fishing by bestowing subsidies on sailing ships of more than thirty tons.16 Later this legislation was extended to cover steamships of over fifty tons .\nSteam fishing ships were soon added to the fleet , the first two being imported into Japan in 1897 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were some \u201c 3000 locally built vessels and 37 sailing and two steam driven ships of European type.\n\u201d 17 This new offshore fishing industry aimed for all manner of fish including herrings , sardines , anchovy , mackerel and squid focusing heavily on the northern seas around Hokkaido .\nThe yield of the Japanese industry exploded with the development of new technology such as gill nets , cotton made nets , and the purse seine nets which were first imported from America in 1882 .\nImage 4 : Russo-Japanese War Ukiyo-e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1904 , \u2018 Russo-Japanese Naval Battle at the Entrance of Inchon : The Great Victory of the Japanese Navy\u2013BANZAI !\n( public domain ) .\nHokkaido became an extremely important jumping off ground for Japanese forestry interests led by the Hokkaido Development Agency ( Kaitakushi \u958b\u62d3\u4f7f ) , following Japan \u2019 s final colonization of the island and subjugation of the Ainu in the 1870s.18 Early attempts to clear land for agriculture had given way to industrial timber extraction in the interior such as Tokkachi and the Daiesetsuzan range19 to feed the Oji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomakomai.20 Hokkaido on both sea and land therefore was very important in the nexus of Imperial economic and political interests .\nDeveloping pressure on fish stocks to the south meant that Japanese fishermen had already explored north to Sakhalin and the Kuriles , even into the Sea of Okhotsk by the middle of the 18th century ( this all being home territory in the Japanese mind ) .\nWhile Imperial Russia had claimed the east coast of Siberia and Primorsky Krai from a weakened Qing dynasty China in the 19th century , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete .\nThe Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 and the Treaty of Portsmouth which followed it gave Japan complete dominance in the seas and the Kuriles and southern Sakhalin ( which was named Karufuto ( \u6a3a\u592a\u5e81 ) by the Japanese ) .\nJapan even gained fishing concessions in Kamchatka and the northern end of Sakhalin and a 1907 agreement between the two nations allowed Japanese companies to establish processing plants on the Russian coast , especially in Kamchatka , reserving much of the offshore for their boats while granting river mouths and bays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese fishing boats and ships were focused on various types of salmon off the coast of Siberia and northern Sakhalin and as Sahrhage and Lundbeck report over \u201c Japanese canneries on Russian territory produced between 60 and 90 % of all tinned salmon , which was mostly exported and sold on the world market from this region.\n\u201d 22 Japan had become a nation with imperial ambitions following the Russo-Japanese war and its annexation of Korea between 1907 and 1910.23 Prior to this , Japan had extended its interests beyond the home islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Okinawa and then aiming its acquisitive gaze to the south incorporating the Bonin and Volcano Islands , part of the same chain which includes the Mariana Islands .\nFishing had always been important to Japan , and a sense of that importance can be gained from other writing including the fantastic work of Jakobina Arch.24 However , fishing endeavors had primarily been around the home islands and focused on fish and whales passing by Japan .\nThe Bonin Islands had presented Japan ( once British possessions but claimed by the Meiji government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in deep sea fishing and trawling for the first time , and its acquisition of what are now the Marshall Islands , Palau and Micronesia ( seized by Tokyo in 1914 and awarded to Japan as the South Seas Mandate by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 ) , presented Tokyo with enormous further opportunities .\nAside from the efforts of the South Seas

@ @ @ @ @ @ efforts far to the north ) , to extract phosphate from the islands , plant and manage sugar cane plantations , Japanese fishing enterprises built an extensive fishing infrastructure on islands such as Saipan.25 Harbors were reconfigured and extended and a number of fish processing plants built .\nJapan would keep its southern mandate until the end of the 1941-1945 Pacific war

the Trans-Siberian Railway and reconfiguration of Russian priorities meant that more Russians and more Russian boats were fishing and crabbing in the area and disputes began to break out between fishing people of the two nations.27 This encouraged the Japanese to engage in further infrastructural and technological development , and by 1920 factory ships for fish processing had been developed which meant that Japan no longer needed as many shore stations.28 In 1930 some 19 factory ships , each accompanied by 2 or 3 ships for laying nets and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked the waters off Kamchatka , canning some 600,000 cases of King Crab , which represented some 30 million crabs.29 This hugely impacted on crab stocks .\nIn 1927 the mothership and factory ship method was deployed on the stocks of salmon and within four years some 13 factory ships and 100 smaller ships were deployed off Kamchatka.30 Such activity again began to create tension between the now organized and effective government of the Soviet Union which had established a fisheries interest in Vladivostok and was concerned to not only compete with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them.31 Japanese fishing interests had also begun to develop trawl and drag net fishing , following the first imported steam trawler in 1908 ( imported from a ship builder in Swansea , Wales ) .32 More than 130 further trawling boats were in place over the next four years .\nSoon , the inshore waters of Japan were restricted to them.33 The trawlers then worked in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea , both fairly shallow with flat beds , perfect for trawling with a focus on fish like Croaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced bull trawling , new technology with long trawl wings and greater capabilities in the extraction of species preferred by the home market.34 Tokyo \u2019 s developing Imperial project meant that bases and processing plants could be constructed for the processing of fish caught by these trawlers in Liaodong and in Formosa ( Taiwan ) , as well as on the Korean peninsula .\nHowever Korea \u2019 s inshore waters were restricted so far as the trawling companies were concerned , as local stocks were too fragile.35 Soon the seas of China began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused north to Kamchatka and the Bering Sea in the early 1930s before going completely global and travelling to the waters around Australia ,

Finally , Japanese development came to Tuna fishing .\nBonito in particular are historically significant to Japanese cooking , providing for many centuries one of the primary elements of the fundamentally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s most popular dishes.37 For much of Japanese history Tuna fishing was a coastal enterprise , using pole and line techniques from open boats taking advantage of those populations of Tuna that passed the home islands using the currents .\nHowever in 1913 new technologies and boat construction practices came to the Tuna industry and they were given motors and their range increased.38 Japan \u2019 s gain of Germany \u2019 s South Pacific territories meant that these new boats could be used in an area of prime Tuna fishing , and new technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific fisheries .\nBy the 1920s boats were capable of carrying 200 tons and , equipped with refrigeration , could sail great distances across the Pacific and the world and fish across all seasons.39 New developments in long lining in which lines could be miles long allowed practical fishing of the Albacore Tuna , a fish of the deep sea and the mid oceans .\nYellowfin Tuna exploitation was begun in the early 1930s with motherships and supporting boat fleets which did not need to be anywhere near land and were truly part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reality of China \u2019 s experience in this narrative of technological and capacity development following the interventions of modernity and colonialism , in both late Qing and pre-1949 Republic of China iterations was that its fishermen were hemmed in by the power of the Japanese Empire , western colonial and capitalist powers and the weakness of Chinese government institutions of the time.41 While shipping and logistics companies and institutions certainly developed around coastal ports in China , almost exclusively at places like Macau , Hong Kong , L\u00fcsh\u00fcn , Tianjin , Dalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve Chinese interests.42 Instead they were concerned with the trade in materials of real interest to European businesses and institutions , which did not include during the period its fish and sea products .\nTrawling was introduced to China by Japanese trawlermen in 1912 after they had been restricted from accessing the home waters of Japan and set up business in Shanghai , attempting to exploit what remained of the stock in Chinese home waters.43 Inspired perhaps by these pioneers and the pressure placed on fishing resources by Japanese interests from Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junk and Sampan had motors installed in the 1920s and then by 1933 , fishers in Shanghai had managed to import nine steam trawlers.44 This meant that Shanghai would become the main site of fishing infrastructure and development prior to 1949.45 Both Japanese imperialism and the struggles of the Chinese civil war meant that much of even this small level of development was lost or destroyed so that by the end of the war \u201c only 600 small wooden trawlers were available , left by the Japanese.\n\u201d 46 Japan \u2019 s fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial and colonial periods , when capitalist logics and rapidly developing technology powered its fishing and other interests across the globe .\nMuch developmental reorganization was undertaken when Japanese authorities began to implant themselves on the Korean Peninsula following the 1907 Protectorate Treaty , seeking to reconfigure Korean institutions and practices not only to accept the power and authority of Tokyo but also the logics of capitalism and state enterprise .\nSo far as fishing and fishing infrastructure were concerned the second report of His Imperial Japanese Majesty \u2019 s Resident General from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three sides of the Korean Peninsula are washed by the sea , and its coast line extends to about 6000 nautical miles , so that the marine products of the country should be abundant .\nWhile the maritime products annually obtained in Japan , which

backwardness of fishing industries and lack of effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after 1910 the Government General , were extremely concerned about the lack of regulation of Korea \u2019 s waters , in particular the presence of poachers of all nationalities and potential overexploitation of whales and other valuable creatures of the sea .\nIn 1908/1909 , before Korea was annexed and became Chosen , the Resident General saw to it that the legislative framework around fishing rights was completely rewritten and the government departments reorganized with Japanese bureaucrats imposed and Korean staff placed within a better structured hierarchy.48 Image 6 : \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Former Colonies , \u2019 Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers , 1946 .\nSummation of Non-Military Activities in Japan and Korea , No 4 , January , 1946 , Tokyo : Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Japan .\nIn 1909/1910 the Resident General established a new nationwide fisheries association which integrated all the local fisheries associations that existed at the time .\nThe national association was also able to give local associations subsidies of some 5000 yen each to purchase new Japanese nets and fishing equipment in order to make some progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of life and income of fishermen .\nThe Japanese in particular appeared appalled by the tiny incomes generated by Korean fishermen , given the potential resources at their disposal .\nThese subsidies to local and national associations were placed on an annual basis after the annexation of Korea , in 1910 .\nFrom this year Japanese fisheries authorities were able not just to improve the capabilities and practices of Koreans themselves but to import Japanese fisher families to the peninsula .\nThe Government General of Korea ( Chosen ) in 1910/1911 reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces and other authorities had been buying land on the Korean coasts for resettlement .\nThis had meant that by the end of 1910 some 45 villages for Japanese fishermen had been established , containing 1600 families with a population of some 6200.49 By 1921 there were over 12000 Japanese citizens living in Korea whose job was solely focused on fishing or the preparation or production of fish products.50 The Government General had also sought to import Japanese methods of salmon farming on the Korean peninsula , introducing fry to rivers and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government General had also sought to diversify the products generated by its colony \u2019 s fishing industry , investing in infrastructure and technology to produce glue derived from fish bones and to export washed seaweed and other products of the sea to Japan .\nBy the early 1920s research and academic organizations from the colonial mainland had begun to implant fishery experts into the various fishery associations established since annexation .\nIn 1920 the Government General established the first experimental fishery research station connected to the wider network on the home islands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base for a steam powered research ship to undertake a geologic survey of the Korean coastline and coastal shelf.53 This development of the Korean fisheries sector and the research surrounding it was focused not only on implanting colonial imperatives into this developmental field , but also really improving the viability of Korean fishing , so that it would pull its financial weight in the empire .\nAfter the sense of disbelief at the moment of annexation that a nation with such an extensive coastline could only derive 8 million yen value from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satisfaction that by 1921 this had been increased to over 45 million yen .\nBy the late 1930 \u2019 s , as noted in Supreme Commander of Allied Powers ( SCAP ) reports dating from after the collapse of the Japanese empire in 1945 and 1946 , Korea had seven core fisheries research stations on the peninsula , which were part of a network of such stations extending beyond the core of the Japanese home islands to Korea , Formosa ( Taiwan ) , the Liaodong peninsula and the South Pacific Mandate.53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the fishing catch from Korean waters , expanded enormously from 1910 and reached a peak in 1931 , becoming then slightly erratic , before fishing effort increased to maintain the upwards curve.54 It was also necessary in 1936 for the Government General of Chosen to obtain a quasi-military cutter to protect the waters of Chosen from infiltration from fishing poachers from China and to control fishing boats from the Japanese mainland .\nThe 1934 Government General report suggests that by that point there were some 116,000 people engaged in fishing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese immigrants would have taken the bulk of the share from the sea and profits as Koreans wages tended to be around 40 % of those for a Japanese worker ) .\nThe result was a huge expansion in the peninsula \u2019 s once moribund industry .\nWhether those fishermen really made a living from the sea in a way which had not been the case before is not clear , and whether the traditional cultural practices which accrued to fishing on the peninsula had been done away with or dissipated is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the reports and other documentation .\nJapanese colonial authorities certainly made great efforts to reconfigure the fishing industry of the peninsula .\nThey concluded : \u201c These and other efforts towards improvement of the fishing industry have already been productive of good results .\nNothing however has contributed more to the recent progress of Korean fisheries than the increased immigration of skilled Japanese fishermen\u2026 \u201d 55 Fishing from the Korean peninsula was sacrificed like so many other elements of colonial developmental policy in the late 1930s and early 1940s to the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading of the colony \u2019 s history between 1933 and 1945 sees much of the effort in the colony being directed at producing military materiel and imperial subjects for Tokyo .\nBoats were commandeered for the war effort and towards the end of the war in 1943 , 1944 and the first half of 1945 it became virtually impossible to go to sea for fishing because of the risk of bombing .\nAccordingly both Japanese and Korean fishing catch and the value of any products produced by the industry collapsed.56 While Korea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the research infrastructure dissipated in this period , and following the capitulation of the Empire to the Americans in August 1945 and the liberation of the Korean peninsula , Japanese fishing companies and crews saw to it that a huge percentage of the Korean fishing fleet was transferred to the Japanese mainland.57 It would take the combined powers of the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers and later the US Army Military Government in Korea several years to return some of the fleet and enable Korea to begin fishing again at anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the war.58This interestingly is in stark contrast with the fishing industry of the Japanese mainland , which SCAP was very concerned to return to strength , and within 18 months had reclaimed much of its former waters in the South Pacific and former whaling grounds in the Antarctic.59 Image 7 : \u2018 SCAP Authorized Whaling Area , Antarctic Ocean , August 1946 , \u2019 Supreme Commander

the Pacific August 15th 1945 , would bring the Japanese Imperial period to an end , and its pre-war empire of fishing would be , for a short period at least , brought to an end .\nThe Korean peninsula gained a momentary independence before being occupied by both the United States and the Soviet Union.76 In 1948 the two Koreas came into being .\nBoth were for some years singularly unsuccessful when it came to deep sea fishing .\nJapan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union ) would in the 1960s and 1970s come to dominate not just the seas they had once controlled but to develop a global stranglehold over fishing resources .\nThese countries would do so through new technologies and statistical theories which have only in the last decade or so been considered in a historical framework for the Pacific Ocean , part of , as Carmel Finley has suggested , \u201c a new empire of fishing.\n\u201d 60 Fish and fish products in this new empire become even more abstracted , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters .\nWhile individual fish and other animals are rather lost in the planetary scale metrics of such development , they are no less energetic .\nOn the Korean peninsula following 1945 it appears that fishing activity diminished , perhaps to the level prior to 1910 .\nFishing communities of the East Asian or Korean near present have been subjected to much of the geo-political reconfiguration and technological change seen in this chapter .\nThe vibrant matters of fishing are a product of a number of the processes of modernity , colonization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities as they are now developed during the late 19th century and early 20th century when Japan itself was under great pressure to modernize its bureaucracy , politics and industry having been opened to colonial forces in the 1860s .\nJapan then projected its own colonial influence onto the South Pacific having been granted some of the former German territories in the Pacific by the League of Nations in 1919 , known as the South Pacific Mandate .\nJapanese industrial tuna and other fishing boats would exploit the waters of Palau , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies , science and statistical sensibilities in the period before the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941 .\nFor the most part these practices and projections sound like the development of industries at a national scale , far from the coastal communities of the past that Arch wrote about and whose lives are so intriguingly intertwined with the journeys and bodies of the sea creatures they seek.61 They were not simply entwined however with the material bodies of maritime species , nor with the communities that sought them , but with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologies which gave power to and projected the power of new forms of state and corporate control in the Pacific .\nSuch control would primarily be exerted on large fish which were radically different in lifestyle from the smaller fish of the coasts and North Atlantic , tuna being primarily a fish of the deep and warm seas , salmon what is known as anadromous in nature , migrating from their birthplaces up continental rivers to the deep sea and then back again as adults to the same spawning grounds from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have complicated lives , long journeys to make and relatively low levels of population growth .\nThese aspects of their lives make them complicated to know , and historically unmeasurable in their numbers as they crossed the oceans .\nIn the early twentieth century however there had been an extraordinary moment in British Columbia , Canada which demonstrated just how impactful human development could be on seemingly unconnected salmon populations .\nJust as the United States had sought to do in settling its western reaches , Canada aimed to build railway lines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky Mountains in British Columbia to reach Canada \u2019 s foremost Pacific port , Vancouver was essential and both the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway sought to use the valley created by the Fraser River to cut through the deep mountains .\nBy 1911 both railways had reached the narrowest part of the river \u2019 s canyon , building a double track all the way through.62 Blasting the rock out to allow a functional embankment and then ballasting the tracks meant that there was a huge amount of stone and soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went directly into the river .\nNeither the railway nor the engineers tasked with building the railway considered that the waterway below their enterprise was perhaps the most important route to spawn for Pacific Sockeye Salmon , and between 1911 and 1914 the river became almost entirely blocked , a rock slide in particular in 1914 completely altering the form and flow of the water.63 Local residents and even company workers noticed quickly that the salmon found it virtually impossible to make their way through the raging waters and tight spaces .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding numbers of Sockeye Salmon that year and in following years , meant that across the Pacific Sockeye numbers were dramatically down for seventeen years after that.64 The normal pattern of large and small years for spawning amongst the salmon was disrupted and in many ways the population never recovered , despite an effort by the railway companies in 1915 to clear the blockage and the invention of \u201c fishways \u201d and \u201c fishgates \u201d to allow safe passage for migrating salmon in future years.65 After the Hells Gate disaster ( as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the fish sought by fishermen in the Pacific and in the waters and rivers of continental United States and Canada could be heavily impacted by human actions .\nThis created a sense of possessive paternalism amongst the nations whose fishermen sought these fish , even while in the case of tuna they would develop new technologies which would allow them to harvest them much more thoroughly from the sea .\nThe United States , Canada , Japan and Russia came to see the salmon in the Pacific as their fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Alaska , which was a favourite ground of Sockeye Salmon and once under the control of Russia.66 Since it had become clear from incidents like Hells Gate that particular groups of migratory fish in the Pacific relied on physical terrains in specific countries to maintain their populations , those nations sought to essentially claim those populations of fish.67 It was easy in a sense to know a Canadian salmon when it was fighting its way back up the Fraser River , much harder when perhaps fish who would one day aim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out towards the Aleutian Islands or even further across the ocean .\nMight it be possible to know where these different populations were when not heading home ?\nDid they mix with other national populations , would it even be possible to restrict other nations from accidentally or purposefully catching one \u2019 s fish , even when they were a long way from \u201c home ?\n\u201d The United States and Canada in fact sought to set out to do just that with the foundation in 1937 of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the war were joined by Japan and Russia as part of the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission.68 These nations set out on a huge research exercise to map the spread and travel of salmon from either side of the Pacific , and eventually through not just statistics , but developments in the knowledge of fish biology and their parasites it became possible to determine that particular groups of salmon were indeed Canadian , Japanese , Russian or American ( particular rivers had specific types of parasites and mineral markers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This embedded a certain form of national politics into perhaps ephemeral or diffuse matters , namely the journeys of fish , matters which became a great deal less diffuse following Japan \u2019 s entry into conflict with the United States in 1941 .\nThese Pacific

where fish originated , resided and moved , as well as a good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacted the fish and other marine life of the Pacific , again hugely .\nPolitical trends which had emerged early in the twentieth century in which nations surrounding the ocean exerted their sovereignty over the less tangible and concrete spaces of the water , influenced by colonial imperatives and concepts of

States Exploration Expedition encouraged by President Jackson or the pressuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom of Hawaii in 1898 by the United States.70 Americans were of course not the only nation involved in the Pacific .\nThe United Kingdom had long enabled the colonization and settlement of Australia and New Zealand .\nFrance and Germany were also deeply engaged in the Pacific islands .\nImperial Germany of course fell foul of world politics following the 1914-1918 war and its extensive territories known as German New Guinea were divided among the victors Australia and Japan by the new League

responsible after the death of Roosevelt for unleashing the atomic bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force Japan \u2019 s surrender , and for setting the course for the future of United States interests in the Pacific , is renowned for decisions made across the field of conflict .\nIn 1945 , the United States Army Government in Korea decided to utilise much of the Japanese imperial government personnel and infrastructure on the peninsula , rather than build up local Korean capabilities , essentially because of concerns about the influence of communist agitators.75 Similarly , while policy towards the Japanese government and its priorities after 1945 was initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American policy became more malleable and supportive of Tokyo , perhaps again influenced by the fear of communist success in Asia and the requirement for a functional and useful ally in the area to serve as a bulwark and a base for American force projection against both Chinese Communist forces and the Soviet Union.76 Truman , it seems , was profoundly concerned with extending the maritime sovereignty of the United States across the Pacific , not simply to support its military and diplomatic capacities , but also to create opportunities for American business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman and the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers ( SCAP ) , were also concerned that Japan should not be too costly to occupy and that it should be capable of assuring its own food supply and other material needs.78 Thus , while American restrictions on Japanese fishing boats were quite severe in the initial months following surrender , by the end of 1945 SCAP gave Japanese boats opportunities to fish further offshore.79 Within 18 months SCAP was infuriating former war allies in Australia and New Zealand by allowing the Japanese whaling fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds in Antarctica.80 Carmel Finley describes the extraordinary policy shifts relating to tuna fishing and control in the Pacific , which had long been hugely important to the Californian fishing industry.81 Former Japanese colonies such as those next to American Samoa and Guam became vitally important to the supply chain for maritime products in the Pacific , but rather than exclusively as sites of enterprise for American companies , they were declared duty free areas , and open to Japanese companies.82 Thus Japanese-owned tuna fishers were allowed to land catches in American Samoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland free of tax or import charges .\nThis put mainland American tuna canneries and other businesses at a distinct disadvantage and this aspect of the United States fishing industry followed its predecessor the sardine canning industry into decline and eventual extinction.83 However the policy served greater American aims by reducing the cost of fish products in the American food industry , securing maritime sovereignty and control over the Pacific for the United States , underpinning the economic functionality and future of American colonial territories such as Samoa , and finally , integrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic interests into the post 1945 status quo .\nThese extraordinary themes of new colonial ambitions , America maritime dominance beyond America \u2019 s western shores , and the integration of new modes and practices of capitalism and free enterprise following 1945 , produced a malleable and flexible developmental landscape which as well as being underpinned and funded by this new geo-political reality found itself energised and enabled by developing scientific and statistical models derived in part from the work of statisticians such as Johan Hj\u00f6rt and Michael Graham on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u201c optimum catch \u201d had developed following what Hj\u00f6rt and others referred to as the \u201c second great fishing experiment , \u201d namely the European war of 1939-1945 .\nWhile Hj\u00f6rt would not live long after the end of the war , Graham , now a vital figure in the infrastructure of fishing and maritime research , and other scientists such as H.R .\nHulme continued working on a statistically minded and empirical approach which might counter the practices of over-fishing , damaging to both fishers and fish populations alike.85 Graham \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidney Holt , developed theories of fish population dynamics86 These theories , first published in the journal Nature as \u201c Population Studies in Fisheries Biology \u201d in 1947 ( later reworked into 1957 \u2019 s book On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations ) , took into account both fluctuations in population , fishing effort projected onto or at them , and the carrying capacity of the environment itself to articulate what has been described as the \u201c steady state yield.\n\u201d This calculation was a twin of the analysis which produced notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 : Raymond Beverton and Sidney Holt , working in the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food

forward development of the scientific basis behind fisheries research and were heavily involved in the creation and foundation of new institutions and places of empiricism , the United States was home to an academic who would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befitting the new needs of the expansionist nation.89Wilbert M. Chapman a scientist from Washington State who had extensive experience of working within the state and federal fishing agencies , was tasked after 1945 with building the practical institutions on the

Sockeye Salmon populations in the Pacific , directing the Pacific Salmon Commission and essentially a foil to the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1948 , he was appointed to the State Department in Washington DC as an undersecretary for fisheries policy.90 Within the State Department , Chapman appears as an energetic organizer of the realities of US focus on the ocean , and very much at the behest of the close nexus between state power and business interests , as Carmel Finley recounts \u201c Chapman and the Pacific Fisheries Congress had tirelessly lobbied to create the undersecretary position at the State Department\u2026The fishing industry \u2019 s support had placed him within the State Department ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his policies \u201d .91 Chapman is known for his energy directed at two principle elements of United States ocean policy , firstly the creation of multinational agencies to manage fishery and maritime resources , and secondly the adoption of a quasi-scientific

Fish in the Sea : Maximum Sustainable Yield and the Failure of Fisheries Management .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the 16th of January , 1949 , via a State Department Bulletin , Chapman articulated how fishing was to be undertaken in this new geo-political and business world , including a graphic curve known as the Maximum Sustainable Yield93 curve While the curve looked , and still looks classically scientific , there were absolutely no statistics given and no references listed in the bulletin.94 In fact the mathematical formulae which underpinned the curve were not made accessible for another five years , while the curve was essentially treated as scientific fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was released .\nContrary to the science and approach that the Europeans had been seeking , Chapman was articulating an extremely utilitarian view of fisheries and the seas in which methodologies derived from industrial management were applied to the sea .\nFish and the other living things in the sea are , as crops in a field , products to be harvested .\nJust as one would not leave wheat grown in a field to fail and rot , so to leave any more fish than were strictly necessary in the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this message into a humanitarian framework : \u201c So long as the resource is underfished there is room for more fishermen to fish and it would be morally as well as legally unjustifiable for a resource of the high seas to be fenced off and not fished to the full extent that is needed to produce the maximum sustained harvest from the resource.\n\u201d 96 Chapman \u2019 s concept included an assumption that fish populations would , as Graham , Holt , Beverton and others had ascertained , fluctuate and fall , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would recover and return to a useful or functional level.97 Maximum Sustainable Yield held to the strange tautology that young fish are helped by the capture of old and large fish and the reduction in a population \u2019 s food requirements , because that leaves more food and resources for the young fish.98 This is strictly counter to earlier analysis done of Sockeye populations which suggested that removing the large and old fish from a population or impacting on their ability to create more generations of young fish means that there will in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size.99 One of the fundamental problems of modern fishing has been that fish are simply not allowed or left to get old or large , so notions of what is a large fish or what is an old fish begin to change and fishermen themselves begin to misread and misremember species \u2019 potential for growth and length.100 Maximum Sustainable Yield held that it was the impact of fishing and human effort according to Chapman \u2019 s model that would stabilize populations ; not going to sea or vigorously harvesting them would even result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful stocks.101 While the United States demarcated its own maritime territories , the policy of the State Department with Chapman at the helm was to internationalize everything else , to the extent that local governments could only exert control over coastal waters \u2013 international waters were free game for the practices and policies of Maximum Sustainable Yield , no matter where they were in the world.102 The United States even pushed the idea in the face of considerable pressures from Latin American countries reacting against increased American tuna fishing and whaling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , concerned about these ructions across the globe , called the International Technical Conference on the Conservation of the Living Resources of the Sea.103 At this conference Chapman and his scientific colleague Milner Schaefer , who had attempted to better theorize Maximum Sustainable Yield essentially defeated the arguments of the Europeans such as Graham and Holt , by appealing to the industrial and economic interests of their own countries.104 Disregarding aspects of the theory which might make over fishing worse or reduce catches , the Americans succeeded ( supported throughout the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out for its own deep sea interests across the globe ) , in maintaining the deep sea as a commons , though allowing for offshore economic zones , and in placing the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield at the heart of the conference \u2019 s conclusions , which were to form the bases for international law of the sea.105 Maximum Sustainable Yield created the fishing industries of our modern world , underpinned by the economics which generated investment capital that transformed the technology involved in global fishing processes .\nShips became larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that problems of spoilage and decay were no longer a concern and so larger ships could put to sea for longer journeys and travel further .\nMotherships were developed as floating factories so that fish caught by a fleet of smaller ships could be processed and packed without ever having to touch land and could then be landed at the most convenient market .\nThese preparation technologies even revolutionized the form that fish were actually eaten in , from fillets and cuts of whole fish , to processed fish sticks and fish fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience economy and society .\nWhere once fishing was a matter of chance and luck , technologies such as sonar and radar allowed fishing boats to see fishing populations from above optimize the catch .\nIn more recent times , these technologies have been superseded by GPS and Remote Sensing from satellites , so that fish movements and stocks can be tracked from space , a developmental technology with aspirations to omniscience rooted in the observation-security complex .\nFrom this is birthed the panoptical tendencies which uncover Chinese \u201c dark fleets \u201d in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea \u201c ghost ships \u201d of earlier years .\nThese fishing empires of the Pacific , in cahoots with extractive and accumulative capital and American and Japanese power , have themselves created so many ghosts , just as the energies of Japanese Imperialism ghosted away Korean fishing materiel in 1945106 and extraordinary rendition and extra-territorial assassination by drone make specters of unwanted humans in the present .\nIndustrial fishing rooted in the statistical framework and presumptions of the American century and the Cold War Empires of Fishing has essentially asset stripped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans .\nIn reality there is little left to catch that has not already been extracted from the waters , coasts and seafloor of the Pacific .\nThe fishing methods and practices of the 20th century guided by the satellite gaze and remote observational techniques have not simply reduced the populations of fish and other species to a fraction of what they have historically been , they have transformed the geographies of the sea and the seabed .\nDeep sea trawling has flattened and reduced the ecosystem of the ocean floor , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other deposits , built not only by geologic and sedimentary time , but by the combined efforts of polyps , worms and mollusks , to often flat deserts devoid of life , but perfect for the interminable scraping of trawling gear .\nFish and maritime ecologies in the Pacific , from which Korean , Japanese and Chinese fishers draw resources , are not simply challenged by the technologies of industrial fishing and the energies of these fishing empires .\nNorth Korean , South Korean and Japanese fishing people and gatherers of coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own nation \u2019 s extensive deployment of coastal and tidal reclamation projects , which have impacted heavily on what were peripheral , marginal , liminal and muddy spaces , but which were very productive for those communities .\nThe author of this article has written extensively on coastal development in North Korea which focused first on tidal and flood control around the River Taedong \u2019 s course and estuary ( particularly at Nampo with the famous West Sea Barrage ) , but later generated large scale coastal reclamation projects such as at Taegyedo.107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of its coasts , such as projects at Ansok in South Phyongan province and Ryongmaedo in South Hwanghae visited quite recently respectively by Pak Pong Ju108 and Kim Tok Tun109 at the time of writing the former and present North Korean Premiers .\nThere is also much written on South Korea \u2019 s reclamation of the Saemangeum Tidal Flats , the largest of many transformational projects on the nation \u2019 s foreshores , including the enormous impacts on the flora and fauna of the landscapes of the flats.110 Across the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive research on the impact of coastal reclamation at Isahaya Bay , which , echoing research addressing changes in the deep sea , suggests that the development has disrupted the sea water exchange process in the bay .\nThis means that the ecologies on which coastal fishing people would rely , are no longer supplied with oxygen , nor are pollutants or agricultural run-off diluted or washed away , creating both the potential for hypoxic and eutrophic conditions.111 Moving from the coast to deeper waters , future Pacific underwater ecologies will be ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacted by both global climate change and by technological and other imperialisms .\nAcidi\ufb01cation of global waters generated by increased and sustained dangerous levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is but the latest challenge to befall the creatures of the Pacific.112 While acidi\ufb01cation so far appears to have a disproportionate long-term impact on species requiring calci\ufb01ed shells and exoskeletons , such as corals , rising water temperatures and rapidly shifting gyres and currents bringing temporary hot spikes could wipe out many fish and sea animals.113 Changes in the routes and topographies used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new .\nJakobina Arch has deftly recounted historical shifts in the migration routes around the Japanese mainland of whales in response to technological strategic developments in whaling practices during Japan \u2019 s Tokugawa period ( 1603-1868 ) .114 However , there is already evidence that rising sea temperatures have begun to shift \ufb01sh populations and their migration routes across the globe so that \ufb01sh species appear in parts of the ocean where they have never been seen before.115 Spider crabs and other predatory crustaceans have also , due to changing temperatures , begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depleting and devastating maritime species who have not through evolution developed a defense or response to them.116 Global audiences have similarly been horri\ufb01ed and trans\ufb01xed by programs such as the BBC \u2019 s Blue Planet II , which not only recounted some of this but also considered the sheer catastrophe of plastic and other non-biodegradable pollutants in our oceans.117 Awareness of seascapes subject to extreme degradation such as the shifting spaces known as the Great Paci\ufb01c Garbage Patch , where tens of thousands of tons of plastic and other material in suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the Paci\ufb01c Ocean through the actions of the North Paci\ufb01c Gyre , have been impacting on both \ufb01sh populations and \ufb01shery communities.118 Very much more local to Korean and Chinese fishing people , the Bohai Sea at the north end of the Yellow/West Sea , has sustained heavy ecological damage due to extensive run off from Chinese agriculture and pollution due to its proximity to ports and industrial centers such as Dalian and Tianjin .\nIt is particularly vulnerable as a relatively shallow body of water that is impacted quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important fishing ground for shellfish , research has shown that temperature rise , changes in salinity and pollutants have had dramatic impacts on species variety , distribution and overall numbers in the Bohai Sea.119 On the other side of the Korean peninsula in the East Sea/Sea of Japan , the international monitoring program CREAMS ( Circulation Research of East Asian Marginal Seas ) , has detected a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen in the deeper waters of the sea , indicating a climate change driven break down in current circulations which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this break down or reduction in circulation patterns in the East Sea/Sea of Japan , the upwelling of nutrients to the surface and significantly diminish the food supplies relied upon by fish and other creatures further up the water column in the deep sea.121 North Korean ( alongside South Korean , Chinese and Japanese ) , \ufb01shing people would be subject to the degradation of the seas and their coasts as a result of all of these factors , many of which their own institutions are in part responsible for , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The oceanic commons which provides North Korea with what it sees as a free resource in spite of its position as a geopolitically , developmentally and institutionally challenged nation , will inevitably be much reduced and diminished .\nIn the context of the Korean Peninsula and its very particular political and geopolitical difficulties , it is perhaps worth also mentioning , beyond the ecological , another factor whose impact is traceable backwards to other Imperial nations across the Pacific .\nIn 1953 the end of the Korean War saw the two sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a peace treaty for a final settlement ) , which drew the conflagration to a close on land , but no agreement could be reached on a mileage limit to settle matters at sea .\nThe peculiar situation of the armistice , which means of course that South Korea as the Republic of Korea , was not a signatory to it , created a situation in which the Syngman Rhee government in Seoul could avoid permanently settling the sea boundaries in the West Sea , but instead unilaterally drew what has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLL ) , which hemmed in North Korean maritime sovereignty , created real problems for its shipping into the important port of Haeju , left islands such as Yongpyeong and Baengnyeong in South Korean hands , though a reasonable reckoning of lines of sovereignty might have deemed them to be North Korean territory and therefore fishermen from North Korea \u2019 s coastal South Hwanghae would not be excluded from their traditional fishing grounds .\nTerence Roehrig has written detailed analysis of the history of the NLL and its implications,122 and Gavan McCormack has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flowed from attempts to resolve the NLL issue,123 but the Line itself is just one element in a regional architecture of security and sovereignty on the coast and in the near sea , which impacts heavily on the options available to fishing people , not just North Koreans .\nThe security needs of both nations has meant that their coastal waters are a securitized zone in which fishing people are monitored and restricted , as this author saw during field work on Gageodo Island , South Korea \u2019 s most south western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation post of the ROK Marines built at the highest point of the island in order to surveil the waters and restrict the fishing efforts of non-compliant Chinese boats.124 North Korean fishing people in the far northwest of the country , who would traditionally go to sea in Korea Bay and the Bohai Sea have themselves been restricted by rules imposed by the People \u2019 s Republic , so that they do not further impact on the fragile ecology of that sea , as well as create a logistical and security issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the security complex produced by the Korean Peninsula \u2019 s \u201c Division System , \u201d 126 the continued echoes of the post 1953 status quo , and more contemporary energies unleashed by geopolitics in East Asia have certainly made an impact in the past , global warming and environmental crisis will surely bring challenges for the future for fish and fishing people alike .\nThere will be new transformations , new ghosts and new disruptions created in the decades to come by forces which have been unleashed by the industrial revolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion engines , that research is only now getting a sense of .\nHowever the impact of the Fishing Empires of the Pacific is already mostly clear , and its transformations are knowable .\nIndustrial fishing in the Pacific and elsewhere has simply transformed the spaces , journeys and spatial possibilities for marine creatures .\nMaximum Sustainable Yield , scientific fishing and the technologies enabling us to see migrating populations from afar , have transformed both the fish themselves and human perception of and relationship to fish and the seas .\nFish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global fishing industry , are no longer allowed to live to anywhere near their normal life spans , so do not in general reach anywhere near their historic potential size .\nSo the fish of our present , really are not the same fish as those of our pasts and human perception of them has radically altered .\nIn the future we have created , but which is only now coming into becoming clear , climate change , temperature rise and transformations of currents and flow across the oceans , and transformation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such alterations will continue .\nFor now , while humans loom larger than life in our anthropocentric times , fish are very much smaller , their geographies and topographies taking up a great deal less space .\nWhether it be on the Korean peninsula , in the Japanese Empire or on the waves of the Pacific Ocean , we have made ghosts of them .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us

Like other national stories , India \u2019 s rests on a belief in a beginning that ranks as the beginning of beginnings : that magical moment of the birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 August 1947 , when the Indian tricolor was raised over the old imperial Parliament to flutter in the late-monsoon Delhi sky , blessed by a distant rainbow.\n\u201d It \u2019 s all downhill from there .\nBut don \u2019 t jump to the conclusion that the authors contend Indians have lost interest in participating in the \u201c world \u2019 s largest democracy \u201d ; to the contrary , they note , \u201c Voter turnout is high , and unusually by global standards , the most marginal parts of society show up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle and upper classes .\nVotes count .\nVotes are dignity.\n\u201d And yet almost from the first days of the \u201c India Story , \u201d things started to go wrong .\nThat much , everyone already knows ; after seven decades of independence from the British Empire , this country of vast population , vast resources , a wealth of ethnic diversity , a long and vibrant history , and \u2013 most important in the modern context \u2013 an admirable and envied constitution , India remains racked with poverty , underachievement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not know is why .\nAnd that is why this book is important .\nNot only in the Indian context ; on nearly every page , non-Indian readers will be reminded of ills in their own societies .\nThat is not accidental .\nIndia \u2019 s great size and unrivaled diversity make it a microcosm \u2013 actually , a macrocosm \u2013 of the world itself .\nDebasish Roy Chowdhury is an award-winning Indian journalist now based in Hong Kong ( and , incidentally , a onetime business editor for this website , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online ) .\nJohn Keane is research professor at Wissenschaftszentrum ( Social Science Center ) Berlin and professor of politics at the University of Sydney .\nClearly , the meticulous research that powers this book was begun before the Covid-19 outbreak that now dominates news about India , to the unfortunate exclusion of nearly everything else .\nMercifully , the timing of their task helped spare the authors from that obsession .\nThat is not to say what they rather quaintly refer to as \u201c the pestilence \u201d is ignored , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than in much of the so-called reporting on Covid that consists largely of click-bait horror stories that almost never put statistics in their proper context by noting India \u2019 s huge population .\n( Brazil is a victim of similar sloppy journalism , while countries like Belgium and Hungary are let off the hook because they are too small to generate dazzling death tolls . )\nIn most of the developing world , and indeed to a large degree in the rich world , ham-fisted efforts to \u201c contain \u201d the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damage than the illness itself .\nThere can hardly be any stronger example of this phenomenon than the \u201c great lockdown \u201d imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2019 s government with almost no notice : \u201c The apocalyptic scenes of reverse migration , the panic over food within just days of the lockdown , the failure to arrange for suitable transport to systematically transfer migrant workers to their place of origin in order to minimize contagion risks , and the calamity confronting Indian hospitals from the earliest days of the pestilence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper social malaise caused by government inaction , mismanagement , and dereliction of duty.\n\u201d The book also steers clear of the error many writers make when documenting recent Indian history , namely to blame it all on Narendra Modi .\nChowdhury and Keane don \u2019 t let Modi off the hook ; far from it .\nBut they observe that he is the product of a long decline in Indian democracy and , hence , Indian society , much as some ( too few and too late ) recognized that Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a remarkably similar decline in the so-called paragon of democracy itself , the United States of America .\nThe book \u2019 s subtitle is India \u2019 s Passage to Despotism .\nA theme of the book is something called \u201c elective despotism , \u201d or what Sweden \u2019 s V-DEM Institute in its Democracy Report 2020 termed \u201c electoral autocracy \u201d when analyzing India \u2019 s \u201c path of steep decline.\n\u201d These seemingly oxymoronic terms speak to the \u201c slow-death \u201d theory of democide , as opposed to the \u201c sudden-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recently in places like Thailand and Myanmar .\nIn this way , not only despite vibrant elections participated in by enthusiastic masses , but actually by means of the nominally democratic franchise , the path to despotism becomes ever steeper .\nFew will find nothing new to learn from this book .\nPractically every aspect of life in India , and not just elections or the other bare bones of democracy , is covered in detail .\nFor example , the authors note that the simple phenomenon of human movement , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a driver of civilization from ancient times .\nAnd the book devotes an entire chapter to transport , titled \u2013 no surprise \u2013 \u201c Motion Sickness.\n\u201d The Indian rail network , launched with fanfare and hope long ago , has not only been yet another disappointment , it has become downright deadly .\n\u201c A ride on a Mumbai train in rush hour , \u201d we read , \u201c is more the stuff of nightmare than dream.\n\u201d \u201c Traveling like animals , risking their lives for livelihood , has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they can remember .\nSo deadly are its trains , and so low the safety bar , that zero fatalities on one day ( 26 June 2019 ) was marked as a milestone .\nThe very next day it was back to business , with nine deaths.\n\u201d But it \u2019 s not just the trains ; buses ( in Bihar , there is one bus per 50,000 people ) , private vehicles ( in Mumbai , \u201c residents on average waste 11 days a year stuck in traffic \u201d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a close ( and un-glamorized ) look .\nThough smartly written , and peppered with anecdotes of ordinary people interviewed by the authors , this book is not light reading .\nPage after page documents tragedy after tragedy , of how the Indian demos has not only been systematically robbed of the hope symbolized by that distant rainbow of August 1947 , but how the demos has actually been redefined by the robbers .\nReaders will be tempted to peek at the closing pages in search of a happy ending .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it \u2019 s more philosophical than the hard-edged , fact-based tone of the bulk of the book .\nTo many , apparently including the authors , belief in democracy has become more of a cult of hope , of paradise in the sweet by and by , than a pragmatic ideology .\nThat may also explain why there is relatively little analysis here of the successes of systems the writers disparage as \u201c tyrannies , \u201d such as the late Hugo Chavez \u2019 Venezuela or , more obviously and much more importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communist China .\nDespite this book \u2019 s fretting title , and the unrelenting evidence within to back it up , its purpose is to deliver a paradoxical message : For all its many failings , government of , by and for the people has been and will continue to be a worthy experiment .\nHow true that message rings is up to the reader \u2013 and , more important , to the people of a great nation \u2013 to decide .\nTo Kill a Democracy : India

tons of garbage daily since the COVID-19 pandemic started last year , with about half considered biodegradable that could have been composted at home to make fertilizer .\nEighty percent of the trash

about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composted at home to make fertilizer .\nImage courtesy of FiveDOL .\nAiming to turn that trash into treasure , an eco-agricultural startup is piloting a program to produce compost and animal feed using black soldier flies .\nFiveDOL Upcycling Corp. started commercial operations in March 2021 , and is the first such outfit of its kind in Mindanao ( a few similar initiatives are launching in the northern Luzon region of the Philippines ) .\nIt uses techniques developed with the help of the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good resource that we can create value from while at the same time helping to conserve the environment and address the problem on biodegradable kitchen waste using the black soldier fly , \u201d Peter Damary , FiveDOL \u2019 s chief executive officer , told Mongabay in a video interview .\nBy harnessing the rapid growth of the flies and their capacity to break down kitchen waste , scientists and

.\nDespite its wasp-like appearance , black soldier flies don \u2019 t sting .\nA female can produce between 500 and 900 eggs during its two-week lifetime .\nThe larvae , once mixed with kitchen waste , grow very quickly : From 1 millimeter in length , the black soldier fly larvae can reach 27 mm ( 1 inch ) long and 6 mm ( 0.25 in ) wide , and can weigh up to 0.22 grams , nearly as much as an aspirin tablet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the black soldier flies , which originated in the Americas , have long been present in the wild in the Philippines and do not pose risks to the local ecosystem , or

they don \u2019 t bite and are not known to transmit any diseases .\nDuring the larval stage , they consume and convert large quantities of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow rich in protein and can be used as alternative feed for chicken or pigs .\nCommercial feeds are usually produced using fishmeal , which has been partly blamed for depleting fish populations from the seas ; or soybeans from Latin America , where industrial-scale farming drives deforestation and consumes high volumes of pesticides and fertilizers .\nBlack soldier fly larvae can be a substitute to these commercial feeds \u2014

\u2019 s tropical mountain forests .\nThese highland ecosystems support massive carbon stores and tremendous biodiversity , including a host of species that occur nowhere else on the planet .\nBut new evidence suggests these havens are in grave danger .\nConversion of higher-elevation forest to cropland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region , according to findings published June 28 in Nature Sustainability .\nBy analyzing high-resolution satellite data sets of forest loss and state-of-the-art maps of carbon density and terrain , an international team of researchers quantified patterns of forest loss in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of this century .\nThey found that during the 2000s , forest loss was mainly concentrated in the lowlands ; but by the 2010s , it had shifted significantly to higher ground .\nBetween 2001 and 2019 , the researchers calculated that Southeast Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square miles ) of forest \u2014 an area larger than Thailand .\nOf this loss , 31 % occurred in mountainous regions , equivalent to 189,100 km2 ( 73,000 mi2 ) of highland forest converted to cropland and plantation in less than two decades .\nMoreover , the study reveals an accelerating trend .\nBy 2019 , 42 % of total annual forest loss occurred at higher elevations , with the frontier of forest loss migrating upslope at a rate of roughly 15 meters ( 49 feet ) per year .\nParticularly prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in north Laos , northeast Myanmar , and east Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia \u2014 the country that experienced the most overall forest loss .\nTerraces are cleared on a

plantations has led the conservation community to perceive forest loss as an issue only affecting the lowlands , said Paul Elsen , climate adaptation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c To see through this study that forest loss is increasing and accelerating in mountainous areas throughout the whole of Southeast Asia was pretty surprising , \u201d he told Mongabay .\nThe expansion of agriculture into higher elevation areas , despite sub-optimal growing conditions due to lower temperatures and steep slopes , spotlights just how scarce undeveloped land now is in lowland Southeast Asia .\n\u201c Just because we found that there \u2019 s a lot of increasing forest loss in the mountains does not mean that we \u2019 re not still seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have to worry about lowland forest loss , \u201d Elsen said .\n\u201c It is just shocking that [ forest loss ] is continuing to move up into places that we felt were safe by virtue of being rugged and remote and isolated.\n\u201d Slopes planted with maize ascend to the tops of hills where they have replaced secondary forest in Nan province , Thailand .\nImage courtesy of Zhenzhong Zeng Worldwide , more than 1 billion people live in mountainous regions .\nForest loss in these areas has far-reaching implications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downstream communities .\nClearing forests in steep headwaters where rivers originate can increase the risk of catastrophic landslips and flooding in lower areas .\nIt also exacerbates soil erosion and runoff , causing rivers to clog with silt and agricultural pollutants , reducing downstream water quality and availability .\nIn 2018 , many people blamed the devastating floods that struck southeast Sulawesi in Indonesia , displacing thousands of people from their villages , on upstream forest clearing .\n\u201c These impacts can kill people , of course , but they also disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services can \u2019 t reach communities , \u201d Elsen said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s hugely impactful when you have increased soil erosion and instability following the removal of trees.\n\u201d Elsen said communities dependent on mountain forests are hit with a \u201c double whammy \u201d when trees are cleared , since they lose the safety net the forest provides against diminished crop yields , which also suffer from diminished water availability and quality .\n\u201c Now that the forest has been removed , you have fewer products available for communities to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation potential , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If left unchecked , this could be a really big environmental problem for the communities living both in the mountains and in the lowlands.\n\u201d Furthermore , a 2021 study showed that deforestation in the tropics can increase local warming by up to 2\u00b0 Celsius ( 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit ) .\n\u201c Local communities living in these frontier zones will suffer much stronger climate warming due to the biogeophysical feedbacks driven by tree loss further compounding the effects of global warming , \u201d Zhenzhong Zeng , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and Technology , Shenzhen , China and co-author of the new study told Mongabay .\nA landslip in Indonesia caused by the removal of trees which has destabilized the steep slope .\nImage by Rhett Butler/Mongabay Nowhere to go If the forest loss continues to march upslope , the consequences for wildlife could be equally devastating .\nRecent studies suggest many species are shifting their ranges to higher altitudes in response to warming temperatures .\n\u201c The mountains of Southeast Asia are one of the most biologically rich regions of the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of mammals , of birds , of amphibians are living only in the mountains and rely on forested ecosystems for their survival , \u201d Elsen said .\n\u201c So the removal of any of those forests will most likely reduce their abundances at a minimum and could potentially cause local extinctions because species that live in mountains often are very isolated in particular spots.\n\u201d \u201c While it \u2019 s not surprising , unfortunately , that forest loss rates are moving up elevation in Southeast Asia , this study importantly quantifies this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservation biologist at Hong Kong University who was not involved in the study , told Mongabay in an email .\nHe said the rate of upslope shift in the frontier of forest loss is very concerning and might hamper species \u2019 ability to adapt to climate change .\n\u201c Not only do these losses of forest cover amount to losses in habitat for species , but the incursion of this forest loss up elevation will also impair biodiversity resilience to climate change , \u201d Bonebrake said .\n\u201c Forest species that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributions in response to warming will have less space to do so.\n\u201d As part of the study , the researchers investigated how forest loss is affecting carbon budgets by overlaying forest loss datasets on high-resolution carbon density maps .\nThey found that carbon stocks in steeper , higher-elevation forests are much greater than in lowland forests .\nThis contrasts with patterns in Africa and South America where lowland forests account for more carbon sequestration .\nThe Southeast Asia pattern is most likely due to greater levels of primary production and organic soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests , say the researchers .\nThe team calculated that the total annual forest carbon loss across Southeast Asia was 424 million metric tons of carbon per year , which is equivalent to one-sixth of all the carbon absorbed by the world \u2019 s oceans each year .\nMountain areas accounted for nearly one-third of that loss .\nTheir findings suggest that assumptions used in global climate change models , which consider all forest carbon emissions as equal , could be inaccurate .\nMoreover , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tree-dominated land cover will persist in Southeast Asian mountains .\nNot only are those mountains losing their forest cover , but the fact that the region \u2019 s mountain forests store comparatively more carbon than lowland forests means that their loss will disproportionately affect climate predictions .\nThe authors calculate that if the patterns of forest loss continue , annual forest carbon loss in the mountains will exceed that of the lowlands as soon as 2022 .\nThey also suggest that the continued loss of carbon-rich forests at higher elevations could eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s forests from being a neutral actor in the global carbon cycle to a net carbon emitter .\nUltimately , the loss of higher-elevation forest will make it much harder to meet international climate objectives to limit global warming to below 2\u00b0 Celsius ( 3.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit ) by the end of this century .\nThis is , according to Elsen , \u201c A very simple message that we need practitioners and policymakers to understand.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your

threefold : \u201c building up its naval-maritime infrastructure ( based and support facilities ) , building up power projection assets , and strengthening relations with increasingly China-concerned powers.\n\u201d Those powers would be India \u2019 s allies in the Quadrilateral Security Dialog , also known as the Quad , a highly informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India and Australia which has been widely viewed as a response to the rise of China as a regional power .\nOriginally initiated by then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2007 , it fell apart when Australia withdrew a year later because

China Policy \u201d Taiwan is considered part of China with one single government representing \u201c One China.\n\u201d Even the US , officially , recognizes the \u201c One China Policy.\n\u201d For example , the US does not have an official embassy in Taiwan .\nIn practice , however , the US uses Taiwan as a foothold of Western influence within Chinese territory , much the way it and its European allies used Hong Kong until very recently .\nThe US carries out highly provocative arms shipments to the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embassy , conducts diplomatic affairs out of what it calls the \u201c American Institute in Taiwan.\n\u201d The US government has also established a presence for other arms of US \u201c soft-power \u201d including the so-called \u201c Taiwan Foundation for Democracy , \u201d a franchise of the US government \u2019 s National Endowment for Democracy .\nThrough this Taiwan-based institution , the US is able to exercise political control over both Taiwan and opposition groups throughout the region who all share an uncoincidental animosity toward Beijing .\nMore recently , the US has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure China overall , and specifically ratchet up tensions between the two global powers over the Taiwan issue .\nReuters in its article , \u201c Pushing against China , US lawmakers plan pro-Taiwan bill , \u201d would claim : Democratic and

.\nReuters also noted the recently introduced EAGLE Act , or the \u201c Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act.\n\u201d While the topic of \u201c ensuring American global leadership \u201d is surrounded with discussion and debate over how to achieve it , the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d the world remains unaddressed by policymakers in Washington .\nChina has between a four and five times larger population than the US .\nIt has access to plenty of resources .\nChina \u2019 s population is hardworking and well-educated .\nAccording to a Forbes article titled , \u201c

the US does .\nThese STEM graduates will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research and development efforts , technological innovation , overseeing advances in manufacturing , and the construction of modern infrastructure both at home and abroad as part of Beijing \u2019 s burgeoning One Belt , One Road initiative .\nWhen added together it is clear that China \u2019 s surpassing the United States both economically and technologically is an inevitability .\nWith this backdrop it is perfectly clear why Washington \u2019 s current obsession with maintaining geopolitical primacy over the planet is fundamentally flawed .\nIt also makes perfectly clear why Washington \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utilizing tools like Harvard University \u2019 s Atlas of Economic Complexity , one can explore the economic ties of a particular nation or territory over the course of approximately 20 years .\nTaiwan \u2019 s economic relationship with both the mainland and the United States plays out in a very illustrative manner .\nIn 1998 mainland China hardly registered in terms of imports or exports which were at the time dominated by the United States and Japan .\nBy 2008 Taiwan \u2019 s economic relationship had become balanced between its American and Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 2018 the tables had completely turned in favor of mainland China .\nEven the US government \u2019 s International Trade Administration admits that China is Taiwan \u2019 s primary trading partner with nearly twice the amount of total trade with Taiwan than with the US .\nIf one counts Hong Kong , Chinese trade with Taiwan is nearly four times greater than that with the US .\nMore than just trade , investments in both directions across the strait reflect an already ongoing economic if not political integration of Taiwan within \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will influence socio-political factors over the long-term no matter how much money the US invests in political interference in the short-term .\nTime is on Beijing \u2019 s side .\nWashington warns constantly of a possible military intervention by Beijing regarding Taiwan , but it is clear China \u2019 s economic rise is a far more

was Australia \u2019 s call for China to admit an international investigation into the origins of COVID-19 that triggered China \u2019 s ongoing trade retaliation .\nBut the truth is China is responding to a range of measures that represent a wholesale shift in the way Australia views it .\nSecurity laws , foreign investment decisions , raids on Chinese journalists \u2013 the list is long .\nThe combined effect of all these measures has been to cultivate an image of China as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business as usual can not go on .\nChina has got that message and is now taking its business elsewhere .\nWe \u2019 ve got ourselves into a position where serious debate as to the rationale for , and wisdom of , Australia \u2019 s foreign and domestic policies involving China is becoming hard

( ASPI ) has likewise been assiduous in talking up risks from China .\nHeaded by Peter Jennings , who advised John Howard on intelligence leading up to the Iraq War , ASPI has often been the @ @ @ @ @

embraced the new mood , adopting the \u201c Wolverines \u201d moniker from the 1980s film Red Dawn .\nWhile that image calls to mind plucky young Cold Warriors putting up a last-ditch defence , the definition of \u201c security \u201d that Australia \u2019 s hawks work with often extends well beyond the Australian continent and its maritime frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive measures a blurry one .\nPaul Monk , one-time director of China analysis for the Defence Intelligence Organisation , recently outlined a five-step plan to push back against Beijing .\nHe advises Australia to configure its \u201c information warfare capabilities \u201d for offence , which will include \u201c talking up the attractive prospects for a more open and tractable China \u201d .\nThe definition of \u201c

the alternative to what they see as America \u2019 s turn to protectionist nationalism .\nWhat of capital itself ?\nAre Australia \u2019 s captains of industry tilting towards China , as many imagine ?\nSome have certainly been sending signals .\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic , it was hard not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Twiggy \u201d Forrest bypassing the government to engage his \u201c Chinese friends \u201d in the medical equipment industry , and then ambushing health minister Greg Hunt by inviting a Chinese consul to the press conference announcing his purchase .\nSome in the immediate firing line of China \u2019 s trade shutdown have been more forthright in their views .\nWhen wine shipments were held up last November , one angry vigneron complained : \u201c It \u2019 s no one else \u2019 s fault , it \u2019 s the Australian government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China probably feel the same way , but there can be a cost for speaking up .\nSo effective has been the suspicion cast on corporate ties to China , that even the mildest critics from that milieu can find themselves pilloried for selling out the national interest .\nMy book is written , though , with an understanding that foreign policy is not so much a field of competing ideas as a field of competing interests .\nAs much as Australia \u2019 s major parties are resolute in their loyalties to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholden to corporate interests .\nIn a field of foreign policy dominated by these two outsized influences , it can often feel as if our options are constrained .\nChina hawks don \u2019 t so much challenge the corporate influence on Australian policy as use it as a foil : if we don \u2019 t side with the United States , they ask , then what \u2019 s to stop Australia dropping its

exposed about the nature of Australia \u2019 s transactional relationship with China , and about China itself , that naturally make people hesitant to endorse any return to \u201c business as usual \u201d .\nThe standard critique of \u201c engagement \u201d \u2013 that the West learned to live with a repressive party-state so as to advance its own political and economic interests \u2013 has much truth to it .\nCompromises that were made to preserve and cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door between politics and the corporate world ; the blurry line between political lobbying and more dubious forms of influence-peddling : all of these issues and more have come into view .\nWhere does Australia go from here ?\nThe solution seems obvious .\nWhat we need is a position not beholden to the paranoid vision of the security agencies or to the priorities of trade , but one that lives up to its profession of universal values .\nThis , of course , is where the structural constraints of foreign policy get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s China politics in a more progressive direction , one capable of both defusing the brewing cold-war conflict and extending solidarity to people in China , there \u2019 s no getting around the fact that those constraints will need to be broken down .\nA wider range of voices and interests need to be represented in the making of Australian foreign policy .\nI sometimes

humanitarian actor on the world stage \u2013 it \u2019 s simply not built for that purpose .\nSimilarly , with occasional exceptions , I avoid referring to a national \u201c we \u201d .\nThe lesson to draw from today \u2019 s conflict over China policy is not that Australia is having trouble identifying its national interest , but that there \u2019 s really no such thing as a single national interest .\nGlobal rivalries for economic and political dominance serve elite interests , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplete public resources and endanger political freedoms .\nTo get out of the rut into which Australia \u2019 s China debate has settled , we need to recentre it on the interests that ordinary people in Australia and across Asia share in both combating oppression and resisting warmongering

respects China \u2019 s immense historical and cultural experiences .\nIn this case , Chinese exceptionalism means respecting Confucianism \u2013 which privileges harmony and abhors conflict \u2013 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2013 over the boisterous , warring , hegemonic Western model .\nThis is reflected in major policy adjustments such as the new \u201c dual circulation \u201d drive , which places greater emphasis on the domestic market compared to China as the \u201c factory of the world \u201d .\nPast and future are totally intertwined in China ; what was done in previous dynasties echoes in the future .\nThe best contemporary example is the New Silk Roads , or Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) \u2013 the overarching Chinese foreign policy concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Renmin University Professor Wang Yiwei , BRI is about to reshape geopolitics , \u201c bringing Eurasia back to its historical place at the center of human civilization.\n\u201d Wang has shown how \u201c the two great

historical counterpart is the Hongwu emperor Zhu , the founder of the Ming dynasty ( 1368-1644 ) .\nThe emperor was keen to present his dynasty as a Chinese renewal after Mongol domination via the Yuan dynasty .\nXi frames it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China used to be a world economic power .\nHowever , it missed its chance in the wake of the Industrial Revolution and the consequent dramatic changes , and was thus left behind and suffered humiliation under foreign invasion \u2026we must not let this tragic history repeat itself.\n\u201d The difference is that 21st century China under Xi will not retreat inward as it did under the Ming .\nThe parallel for the near future would rather be with the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , which privileged trade and interactions with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torrent of Western misinterpretations of China is a waste of time .\nFor the Chinese , the overwhelming majority of Asia , and for the Global South , much more relevant is to register how the American imperial narrative \u2013 \u201c we are the liberators of Asia-Pacific \u201d \u2013 has now been totally debunked .\nIn fact Chairman Mao may end up having the last laugh .\nAs he wrote in 1957 ,

also likely that the whole structure of imperialism will utterly collapse.\n\u201d Martin Jacques , one of the very few Westerners who actually studied China in depth , correctly pointed out how \u201c China has enjoyed five separate periods when it has enjoyed a position of pre-eminence \u2013 or shared pre-eminence \u2013 in the world : part of the Han , the Tang , arguably the Song , the

.\nBut even the Chinese side seems to be daunted by the cost and sheer magnitude of a trans-Himalayan railway , especially its engineering challenge .\nNepali Times had revealed in 2019 the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alignment from Kerung to Kathmandu through a series of tunnels below Langtang National Park .\nChinese engineers found the gradient from the Tibetan Plateau to the low valleys in Nepal

promote common development and economic integration across global south countries and beyond by facilitating the creation of infrastructure which overcomes geographic obstacles in order to establish

, one BRI project of note is the China-Laos High Speed Railway , which will connect the Laotian capital Vientiane with Kunming in China \u2019 s Yunnan province at the end of this year .\nIt will

two-story house in Singapore .\nIn a late-night report on Tuesday night , CNN Brasil revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forced the government to suspend the contract .\nIn the 11-page official report , as per CNN Brasil , the focus of the investigation is the invoice from Madison Biotech .\n\u201c Five points are listed to justify the suspension : Attempt to make advance payment , without contractual

signing of the contract , Covaxin had not been approved by Brazil \u2019 s National Health Surveillance Agency ( ANVISA ) .\nYet , its purchase price was agreed at $ 15 a dose , the highest paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six vaccines contracted so far .\nRejected by ANVISA on March 31 and then approved for limited import with strict conditions on June 4 , the Indian vaccine has been mired in a controversy for months .\nNow , it is at the centre of a massive scandal that is rocking the Brazilian government and tearing apart Bharat Biotech \u2019 s reputation as pharmaceutical company .\nAmid damaging

wash their hands of the deal .\n\u201c The question is not if the government wants to terminate the contract , the question is when they will cancel it .\nIt is taking time because the contract is

For the Bolsonaro administration , which has been completely cornered by the CPI over the purchase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the scandal is now too hot to handle .\nBut the suspension \u2013 or eventual termination \u2013 may not bring any closure as the senators leading the parliamentary probe are not in a mood to give up on their trail of money in the deal .\nOn Tuesday , soon after the government \u2019 s announcement to suspend the deal , Senator Randolfe Rodrigues , the vice president of CPI , called it a \u201c confession of guilt \u201d .\n\u201c If nothing was wrong ( in the contract ) , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one word for it : Confession !\n\u201d the senator wrote on Twitter .\nThe senate probe has gone too deep into the scandal surrounding the Indian vaccine to give it up now

president .\nWhen the invoice story was revealed last week , the government tried to accuse Ricardo Miranda of tampering with it , but it was soon proved that the document was in the ministry \u2019 s computer system and had not been forged .\nThen the government claimed that the president had forwarded the complaint to then minister of health , Eduardo Pazuello .\nThe senators from CPI found this claim to be fragile because Pazuello was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after the brothers meeting with Bolsonaro .\nOn Tuesday , the government came out with the third version , claiming that Pazuello had forwarded the complaint to the executive secretary of the ministry , \u00c9lcio Franco , who would have done a \u201c proper \u201d check .\nIt was immediately pointed out by senators that Franco was also dismissed just three days later and had no time to probe the matter .\nOn Ricardo Miranda \u2019 s testimony that he told the president about being under \u201c extreme pressure \u201d from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment from a company which is not part of the contract , Bolsonaro is standing on thin ice .\nAs per Brazilian law , not reporting a wrongdoing by a public official is a crime of malfeasance \u2013 an impeachable offence .\nThree senators , including the CPI vice president , asked the Supreme Court on Saturday to open a criminal case against the president .\nOn Monday , an

senate investigation may be extended by a few weeks as has been demanded by CPI , during which the investigators plan to dig up more dirt on corruption , especially in the Covaxin deal , before they prepare their report which may shake up the country \u2019 s politics .\nAt the heart of this probe is the invoice from Madison Biotech presented by Ricardo Miranda at his testimony .\nWhat could be giving sleepless nights to officials at the presidential palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miranda will be appearing again at the senate but this time in a closed-door session .\nThere has been speculation , hinted strongly by Luis Miranda , that there is a recording of the brothers \u2019 conversation with Bolsonaro where no other person was present .\nBolsonaro \u2019 s silence on the Miranda brothers \u2019 testimony is a sign that he knows what is coming .\nIn recent days , his allies have become shaky , rallies called by his supporters have been no-shows and anger against his government has

May 25 , accusing her in a 71-point brief of causing the deaths of Indian citizens by misleading them about Ivermectin .\n\u201c That your misleading tweet on May 10 , 2021 , against the use of Ivermectin had the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the protocol on May 11 , 2021 , just a day after the Tamil Nadu government had indicated the same for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\u201d Advocate Dipali Ojha , lead attorney for the Indian Bar Association , threatened criminal prosecution against Dr. Swaminathan \u201c for each death \u201d caused by her acts of commission and omission .\nThe brief accused Swaminathan of misconduct by using her position as a health authority to further the agenda of special interests to maintain an EUA for the lucrative vaccine industry .\nSpecific charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Ivermectin and issuing statements in social and mainstream media to wrongfully influence the public against the use of Ivermectin despite the existence of large amounts of clinical data showing its profound effectiveness in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 .\nIn particular , the Indian Bar brief referenced the peer-reviewed publications and evidence compiled by the ten-member Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance ( FLCCC ) group and the 65-member British Ivermectin Recommendation Development ( BIRD ) panel headed by WHO consultant and meta-analysis expert Dr. Tess Lawrie .\nThe brief cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital cases in New York where court orders were required for dying COVID patients to receive the Ivermectin .\nIn multiple instances of such comatose patients , following the court-ordered Ivermectin , the patients recovered .\nIn addition , the Indian Bar Association cited previous articles published in this forum , The Desert Review .\nAdvocate Ojha accused the WHO and Dr. Swaminathan in Points 60 and 61 as having misled and misguided the Indian people throughout the pandemic from mask wear to exonerating China as to the virus \u2019 s origins .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your absurd , arbitrary and fallacious approach in presenting concocted facts as \u2018 scientific approach.\n\u2019 While the WHO flaunts itself like a \u2018 know it all , \u2019 it is akin to the vain Emperor in new clothes while the entire world has realized by now , the Emperor has no clothes at all.\n\u201d The brief accused the WHO of being complicit in a vast disinformation campaign .\nPoint 61 states , \u201c The FLCCC and the BIRD have shown exemplary courage in building a formidable force to tackle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuke from pharma lobbies and powerful health interests like WHO , NIH , CDC , and regulators like the US FDA.\n\u201d Dr. Swaminathan was called out for her malfeasance in discrediting Ivermectin to preserve the EUA for the vaccine and pharmaceutical industry .\nPoint 52 reads , \u201c It seems you have deliberately opted for deaths of people to achieve your ulterior goals , and this is sufficient grounds for criminal prosecution against you.\n\u201d The Indian Bar Association posted an update on their website June 5 , 2021 , noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThey wrote , \u201c However , deleting the tweet will not save Dr. Soumya Swaminathan and her associates from the criminal prosecution which is to be launched by the citizens with active support from the Indian Bar Association.\n\u201d In this update , Advocate Dipali Ojha clarified the nature of the planned action , \u201c The Indian Bar Association has warned action under section 302 etc .\nof the Indian Penal Code against Dr. Soumya Swaminathan and others , for murder of each person dying due to obstruction in treatment of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is death penalty or life imprisonment.\n\u201d \u201c After receiving the said notice , Dr. Soumya Swaminathan went on the back foot and deleted her tweet .\nThis has proved the hollowness of the WHO \u2019 s recommendation against Ivermectin for COVID-19 .\nThe dishonesty of WHO and the act of Dr. Soumya Swaminathan in deleting her contentious tweet was witnessed by citizens across the world , as the news got a wide coverage on social media .\nBy deleting the tweet , Dr. Soumya Swaminathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire world witnessed the effectiveness of Ivermectin against India \u2019 s deadly second surge as the locations that adopted it saw their outbreaks quickly extinguished in stark contrast to those states that did not .\nAmong the most prominent examples include the Ivermectin areas of Delhi , Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand , and Goa where cases dropped 98 % , 97 % , 94 % , and 86 % , respectively .\nBy contrast , Tamil Nadu opted out of Ivermectin .\nAs a result , their cases skyrocketed and rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths increased ten-fold .\nTamil Nadu publicly relied upon Dr. Swaminathan \u2019 s advice in revoking their initial choice of Ivermectin the day after she recommended against it in her May 10 tweet on social media .\nAs a direct result , Tamil Nadu experienced a surge in COVID death and sickness that continues to this day .\nThe Indian Bar Association dared to initiate a landmark court case against a Public Health Authority ( PHA ) to call out corruption and to save lives .\nAs the courts in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure a patient \u2019 s right to receive Ivermectin , a court in India is now doing the same .\nCriminal prosecution of public health officials will send a powerful signal that disinformation campaigns resulting in death carry consequences .\nPerhaps this pathway will ultimately break the disinformation and censorship stranglehold around repurposed drug use to save lives .\nMaybe we will witness other countries following India \u2019 s example , both in medicine

far , around 176 dead turtles have got washed onto different beaches around Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turtle Conservation Project of Sri Lanka ( TCP ) .\nMarine turtles washing up dead on the Indian Ocean island are common around this time of year , which is when the peak of the monsoon turns the seas rough and leads to the turtles being fatally injured .\nBut this June , the waves have brought in an \u201c abnormally high \u201d number of turtle and even dolphin carcasses , Kapurusinghe told Mongabay .\nFive of the world \u2019 s seven marine turtle species nest along Sri Lanka \u2019 s southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks the height of the nesting season , according to Lalith Ekanayake , chairman of the Bio Conservation Society .\nBut this period has also been marked by what environmental activists and experts warn is the biggest maritime disaster unfolding in Sri Lanka \u2019 s history .\nIn late May , the Singapore-flagged cargo ship MV X-Press Pearl caught fire off Colombo , on Sri Lanka \u2019 s western coast , and sank in early June .\nIt was carrying a cargo of nitric acid and plastic pellets , among other items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bunker fuel .\nModeling by researchers has shown that ocean currents would carry these pollutants south , right through the path of the turtles and toward their nesting sites , Ekanayake told Mongabay .\n\u201c The timing of the accident couldn \u2019 t have been worse than this as the number of turtles in our waters would be high during this time as April-May records the highest number of nesting occurrences , going by past research , \u201d Ekanayaka said .\nSatellite tracking data show that most migratory turtles nesting in Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shore up to the Gulf of Mannar in the north before moving out to their feeding grounds .\nThis makes them more vulnerable to any pollution from the ship accident , Ekanayake told Mongabay .\nKapurusinghe highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend revealed by the turtle carcasses reported from various locations : most of the dead turtles are juveniles .\nImmature turtles are more likely than nesting adults to stay close to shore , mainly to feed .\nThat makes it \u201c possible that these deaths are linked to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the freighter , \u201d Kapurusinghe said .\nThe carcasses have been sent to the Department of Wildlife Conservation (

.\nOne turtle showed injuries that may have been by the explosion of the X-Press Pearl .\nFurther laboratory tests are being conducted to get a conclusive answer .\nAccording to Jayawardana , most of the dead turtles are olive ridleys ( Lepidochelys olivacea ) , but there are also some green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) , hawksbills ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) and leatherbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolphins and 4 whales have also washed ashore during the past month .\nMost are dolphins , while there was also a juvenile blue whale .\n\u201c I have been observing whale strandings and deaths for over 30 years and this is a clear increase of their deaths , \u201d said Ranil Nanayakkara , co-founder of the NGO Biodiversity Education And Research ( BEAR ) .\nNanayakkara added that , unlike sea turtles , marine mammals tend to sink to the seabed after dying , so only one in four may get washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine mammals have died than the number that have washed ashore .\nDuring the first few days after the X-Press Pearl \u2019 s sinking , it was nearshore dolphin species such as humpbacks ( Sousa chinensis ) and spinners ( Stenella longirostris ) that were washing ashore .\nLater , there were other species , including the dwarf sperm whale ( Kogia sima ) , spotted dolphin ( Stenella attenuata ) , striped dolphin ( Stenella coeruleoalba ) and melon-headed whale ( Peponocephala electra ) , indicating the impact of possible spreading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these deaths may not be related to the ship accident , he added .\nA case in point is the juvenile blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ) found in northern Sri Lanka , away from where the pollutants may have spread .\nNanayakkara said it \u2019 s important to carry out a thorough analysis of each carcass to determine the cause of death .\nThere \u2019 s no consensus within Sri Lanka \u2019 s scientific community over whether the sinking of the X-Press Pearl and the high number of marine animal deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority ( MEPA ) and other government agencies have appeared hesitant to put an end to the speculation , and several politicians have forwarded their own theories for the animal deaths .\nAsha de Vos , a marine biologist with Oceanswell , said in a tweet that \u201c We have to be cautious about making assumptions without evidence.\n\u201d She noted that \u201c The truth is , animals die at sea .\nIf currents flow shoreward ( As they are doing on our southern and western coasts right now ) , the carcasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for an end to speculation and theorizing , and for scientific reasoning to identify the cause of death .\nShe also noted that the reporting of more carcasses than before could also be a result of \u201c observer bias , \u201d where people who previously didn \u2019 t pay attention to the issue were now more conscious of it as a result of the ship disaster .\n\u201c The main the issue here is the lack of baseline data to compare the environmental parameters and the number of marine creature stranding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the sinking of the ship and an increase of turtle and marine mammals deaths , \u201d said Nishan Perera , co-founder of the Blue Resources Trust .\nHe said Sri Lanka urgently needs national-level , long-term monitoring of environmental parameters in the ocean using a standardized methodology .\nHe said such data should be published

lockdown conditions earlier this month .\nA good deal of this was occasioned by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June , which saw the state of New South Wales become the last bastion to yield to the lockdown formula .\nFor the duration of the pandemic , the state government saw the blunt approach as unnecessarily harsh to residents , preferring to rely on fabled common sense .\nWe , the argument went ,

gathering at a birthday party of around 40 people , one of whom had unknowingly crossed paths with the driver .\nThose not infected turned out to be the ones who were vaccinated .\nWhile the critics have been , and will be noisy about the tardy reaction of the Berejiklian government in NSW , nothing can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth , whose primary responsibilities on quarantine and public health have been forfeited .\nThis monumental debacle , a product of smugness and contentment , was bound to unfold .\nThe building of specially adapted quarantine facilities to house arrivals from overseas was stubbornly resisted when Australia was essentially free of COVID-19 .\nHotel-based quarantine , run by the State governments , was deemed more than suitable .\nThere was also a diabolical lack of vision on purchasing a range of vaccines .\nAll that mattered was the AstraZeneca option , billed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Australia a sovereign capability .\nManufacturing it on home soil was celebrated as something visionary .\nBut that was not to be .\nThe roll out has been stuttered , erratic and abysmal .\nThe blood clotting controversy , a risible communications strategy , and a worried public , has left the Morrison government floundering .\nOther vaccines had to be selected , and supply of these remains woeful .\nTo date , just 7 % of Australians are fully vaccinated .\nGetting a sense about how profound this floundering could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharmaceutical giants to begin with .\nWhat , exactly , was promised by either of the parties ?\nOn that score , the Morrison government is keeping mum , as well it might .\nSecrecy is often the first refuge of the incompetent , and there is much secrecy on the way the Commonwealth has been implementing its vaccine

organizing new enterprises have found alternative ways for harnessing the labor of workers in new settings , whether in the mills of Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford or hull construction at the Nagasaki Shipyard.6 But somehow , according to the Japanese government narrative , new machines ( what the government narrative simplistically calls \u201c technology \u201d ) were introduced into Japan from the West between 1850 and 1900 .\nThe Meiji Restoration began in 1868 , but the sites push the beginning date back to late Tokugawa , allowing a convenient \u201c half century \u201d for Japan \u2019

is Korean or Chinese , the three main languages of foreign visitors to Japan .\nIt is at the local level that the historical documentation is the most distorted , and designed almost entirely for Japanese tourists .\nWere all Miike coal miners Japanese from 1939 to 1945 ?\nThe Omuta website would lead you to this conclusion .\nHere is the reality for those years \u2013 World War II .\n\u2022 Japanese ( all employees ) : 11,000 / probably less than 10,000 miners Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusive treatment and extreme death rates of these non-Japanese workers consistent with slave labor.9 Japanese listed in the table above include all employees ( surface , underground supervisors , guards , and actual miners ) , averaged over the seven year period .\nWomen are not included in the sources for these statistics , but there is no evidence of their presence underground during the war , in contrast to smaller mines to the north in Kyushu \u2019 s Chikuh\u014d region .\nKoreans include all employees , the vast majority forced laborers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards serving as collaborators for the Japanese .\nChinese were all forced laborers , the majority most likely farmers taken by force in China , while a minority were prisoners-of-war who had been fighting against Japanese troops in Northern China .\nAllied prisoners-of-war arrived at different times , with Americans , Dutch , and British arriving earlier .\nAustralians arrived later , suffering more than these earlier arrivals from their previous POW camp locations \u2013 the vast majority coming from the Thai-Burma \u201c death \u201d railway construction .\nThe estimated total forced labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , was probably over 4,000 .\nFor Japanese underground supervisors , there generally was one for each group of five to six miners , reducing Japanese employees from 11,000 to about 10,200 , and then below 10,000 for guards , and reduced even further if administrators are subtracted .\nMany POWs worked in the Mitsui foundry adjacent to the mine , but foundry employment numbers were small compared to the mine .\nA handful worked on the surface in various service capacities .\nWith these other POW positions taken into account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nationalities were forced \u2013 or more accurately , slave \u2013 laborers .\nThis system of prisoners used as workers became widespread in the first decades of the Meiji Era , introduced in Miike in 1873 when the coal mine was bought from local owners by the new Meiji government .\nWhen Mitsui took over the Miike mine from the government in 1889 , the company continued using convict labor through contracts with the government.10 The exact type of punishment used against some Allied POWs in World War II at the Miike Mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting from the Tagawa Coal Museum in the Chikuh\u014d region of northern Kyushu illustrates .\nThis particular disciplinary practice used on coal miners was known as yama no miseshime \u2013 using the mountain to warn others \u2013 by forcing the worker to kneel on wooden slats and then placing heavy weight on his thighs , increased as time went by to make the pain worse , along with beatings.11 Painting by Yamamoto Sakubei , Yamamoto Sakubei to tank\u014d no kiroku , p. 26 .\nA fundamental rationale for the World Heritage listing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meiji Industrial Revolution \u201d is the central role of heavy industry in this process , focusing on three key industries : iron and steel ; shipbuilding ; and coal mining .\nThe scope of the industrial revolution , the Japanese government claims , covered the years from 1850 to 1910 , spanning the end of Tokugawa and all of Meiji except the last two years.12 The endpoint of this periodization for historians is simplistic when applied to steel ( Yahata works ) and shipbuilding ( Nagasaki shipyard ) , but does have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is not a valid example if underground mining technology is a factor .\nThe way to understand \u201c industrialization \u201d is in how production processes occur , which involves the transition from exclusively manual labor to mechanized labor incorporating new machines and technology .\nMitsui \u2019 s Miike Coal Mine is generally considered to have been the first \u201c advanced \u201d coal mining operation in Japan , but underground its operations remained primitive until the early 1920s when minimal mechanization was introduced in some mine pits .\nThis is a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan generally lagged behind Western technological advancements in underground mining until after World War II .\nThe way to track this lag is through the history of changes in Mitsui \u2019 s workforce from the 1890s through 1945 and how its changing workforce was utilized .\nCoal fueled industrialization in modern Japan .\nJapan \u2019 s coal fields contained bituminous coal , but not anthracite , the type used for coke in the production of steel .\nJapan \u2019 s coal was used entirely for energy .\nMeiji certainly was an era when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution occurred in terms of large scale extraction of coal and introduction of surface mechanization ( hoists , water pumps ) that allowed expansion of coal mines .\nRail expansion used coal for engines .\nModern manufacturing required new sources of energy , and these were either from hydro-electric or coal-fired plants .\nElectrification of Japan \u2019 s cities drew from these plants , but especially utilizing coal as the source.13 Important developments in coal mining centered on the rise of the two most important private business combines in late nineteenth century Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880s , these two zaibatsucontrolled the two largest coal mines in the country , both based in Kyushu : Takashima ( two islands , one being Gunkanjima on Hashima ) off the Nagasaki coast , bought by Mitsubishi from the Meiji government ; and Miike Coal Mine at Omuta ( Fukuoka prefecture , bordering Kumamoto prefecture ) , bought by Mitsui .\nDuring this period , the largest coal fields being developed in Japan were in Kyushu ( Takashima \u2019 s islands , Miike at Omuta , and the Chikuh\u014d region in northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nLarge scale development of the huge Hokkaido coal reserves occurred later and did not rest on major technological innovations of the industry between the 1880s and 1920s .\nMitsui relied substantially on contracting convict laborers from the Meiji government from the 1880s until 1900 at the Miike Coal Mine .\nFollowing the 1899 Prison Law restricting convict use , a national cap of 400 on the number of convicts allowed in coal mining shifted the Miike workforce from predominantly convict to a rise in husband-wife teams , known as sakiyama / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn from farming areas around Omuta , with men extracting the ore and women collecting it hauling it to the surface.14 Chikuh\u014d mines , even those of Mitsubishi and Mitsui , had less capitalization and came to rely on cheaper Inoue Tamejiro , artist .\nPortraying women miners in the Miike Coal Mine , \u201c Meiji jidai no tank\u014d f\u016bzoku \u201d [ Meiji Era coal mine customs

1910 .\nProductivity above ground may have driven this dynamic as well , with Mitsui \u2019 s Miike Coal Mine efficiency due to shorter transport links between mine pits and harbor at Omuta , compared to Chikuh\u014d mines further inland that had to send coal by rail to ports at a considerable distance to the north .\nDan Tokuma became head of the Miike Coal Mine in the 1890s and introduced a number of administrative reforms at the turn of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also involved an end to using contractors for non-convict Japanese miners , with the aim of eliminating turnover while seeking to gain local loyalty of workers , what historian Tanaka Naoki has described as \u201c a familial approach to business management.\n\u201d 15 The following table documents the radical shift from convict to non-convict labor at Miike from 1894 to 1900 , and then the sharp rise in women workers afterward , finally ending after 1930 when all women were excluded from underground work at Miike .\nHoists and air shafts were introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but more advanced mining technologies for underground mining only arrived in the following decades \u2013 after Meiji .\nThese were technologies developed first in the West , but only introduced later in Japan .\nAccording to Donald Smith , \u201c Mitsubishi and other major mines began another spurt of mechanization in the latter half of the 1920s , building on the changes in mining practice in the early 1920s.\n\u201d This shift was from sole use of mining tunnels \u2013 the room and pillar system , zanch\u016bshiki saitan \u2013 to long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with room-and-pillar .\n\u201c Mines installed boring machines and rock drills , eliminating the necessity of drilling holes by hand for dynamite .\nFrom 1927 or 1928 , they installed coal cutters [ undercutters essential for long wall mining ] \u2026 mechanical picks [ and ] face conveyors , which sped the coal on the first stage of its journey out of the mine.\n\u201d 16 This technological transformation in the 1920s resulted from Mitsubishi \u2019 s and Mitsui \u2019 s ready access to capital through their zaibatsu internal banks and other divisions

mining can easily be understood if one thinks of a bed of coal as an underground field extending for hundreds or thousands of acres .\nWhen coal is reached by shaft or slope , a main entry is driven .\n\u2026 Then two parallel tunnels are driven off to one side , four hundred to six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels , made permanent with timber and other construction material , the longwall mining is done .\nThe miners ( a whole gang rather than just two or three in a work space ) work at the face under a set of movable pillars , which they move forward ( one at a time ) as the face recedes.\n\u201d 18 American coal miners resisted the longwall system until the 1920s because skilled miners viewed it as eroding their control over the work process they had with the room-and-pillar system .\nImplementation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one that was more artisan-based to one similar to a factory environment , with teams and direct supervision , and new machinery required to extract and load coal .\nThe Japanese coal mines also had individual \u201c artisan \u201d miners , but they were the dual system of husband-and-wife miners in contrast to the American all-male underground setting .\nAmerican miners in some locales had a strong union movement by the early part of the twentieth century that led to resistance to mechanization , whereas Japanese miners had no substantial labor organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teams and longwall mining appear to have been driven by Mitsui \u2019 s management introduction of new technology among miners .\nJapan \u2019 s first labor union , the general membership Yuaikai , had a coal mining membership base , and in 1912 Mitsui coal miners went on strike for five months , Japan \u2019 s largest prior to World War I , but were defeated by the company.19 Trade union organization among coal miners revived under a different industrial union formation during the 1920s , but could not be sustained under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s.20 In contrast , the United Mine Workers of America became the backbone of the industrial union organizing movement in the United States by the 1930s with a membership of over 800,000 by the early 1930s .\nThe lag in the rate of mechanization in Japan \u2019 s coal mining related to over-reliance on labor intensive production , a dynamic that did not substantially change underground until the 1920s .\nBelow are examples of coal mining equipment innovations internationally .\nThese were not introduced into Japan , including the Miike mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until after the end of the Meiji Era .\n\u2022 Rock drilling tools \u2013 1882 in U.S. ( Brunner and Lay ) \u2022 Undercutting chain machine \u2013 1913 in U.S. ( Sullivan Machinery Co. ) \u2022 Coal loading shovel \u2013 1925 in U.S. ( Jones Coloder , others ) Japan did introduce some innovations , as the Komatsu example indicates , but this was after Meiji , and this innovation did not change the crude underground system of industrial relations heavily reliant on manual labor .\nCoal loaders , marketed by 1918 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been absent at Miike , which was still using horses in the 1920s for pulling coal cars along tracks where they could then be brought to the surface.21 Limited mechanization took off in the large mines in Japan after the First World War , driven by major shifts in the labor structure within mines .\nTakeshima ( Hashima / Gunkanjima ) and Miike mines led the way , leading to increased miners \u2019 wages while maintaining relatively primitive labor practices underground .\nMechanization in the 1920s at Miike coincided with introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal , which reduced the use of women to collect the ore .\nMine work now utilized teams that loaded huge volumes of coal that could be shoveled into coal cars and then hauled to the surface via lifts .\nSmith states that this process was possible once coal cutters were installed with face conveyors , but this change appears to have been confined to major mines in Chikuh\u014d and not all the pits in Miike.22 By 1930 , the Miike Coal Mine in Omuta completely eliminated both convict labor and women workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of females from underground work was in line with Japan \u2019 s agreeing to the ILO stand of 1928 for the elimination of women from underground coal mines , but Smith believes that the company \u2019 s decision was a consequence of technological change .\nWomen continued as surface workers sorting coal .\nThe practice of using women miners underground continued informally in smaller mines of the Chikuh\u014d region , despite the national government prohibiting the practice by 1933 .\nJapanese women returned to underground work at the end of World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so at the Miike Coal Mine .\nHistories of Japanese coal mining on women published in English have tended to focus on the Chikuh\u014d region of northern Kyushu , where there was a wide diversity of small , medium-sized , as well as some large mines operated by Mitsui and Mitsubishi .\nIn that region women continued to work illegally in the medium and smaller mines after 1930 .\nThese are significant studies , but only reveal part of the larger picture of Japan \u2019 s coal mining history , particularly during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in an entirely different coal field , where Mitsui employed quite different labor practices .\nDistinctions in regional coal fields of Japan are crucial to understanding the contrasts between mines where women miners were employed and those where they were eventually pushed out of underground mining after 1930 .\nThe map below , from Arents and Tsuneishi ( p. 126 ) , shows the distinct geography of these separate regions that was an aspect of these two quite different coal mining environments .\nJapan \u2019 s wartime empire and slave labor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan \u2019 s \u201c Meiji Industrial Revolution \u201d World Heritage sites is directly linked to Japan \u2019 s war and pursuit of empire in the Asia Pacific .\nDuring the Meiji Era ( 1868 to 1912 ) Japan colonized Taiwan , the Ryukyus ( Okinawa ) , and Korea , and gained footholds in Manchuria and ports in China .\nThis expansion of empire required a modern navy and army , with steel , ships , munitions , and coal as the economic foundation for Japan \u2019 s competition with the West .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Sino-Japanese War , initially establishing operations in Taiwan , Korea , Manchuria and China from 1896 to 1907.24By the advent of the Pacific War in the 1930s , Mitsui was the largest Japanese company to invest in China and Japan as supplier of military and civilian imports.25 With Mitsubishi , Mitsui laid the foundation for Japan \u2019 s economic and military dominance of East Asia and the western Pacific .\nIn 1938 , with Japan \u2019 s massive escalation of its invasion of North China , tonnage of coal extracted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at over 4 million tons .\nBut in 1945 production collapsed along with the rest of Japan \u2019 s productive capacity and infrastructure , and its empire , the euphemistically dubbed \u201c East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere , \u201d vanished .\nThis term is nowhere to be seen in historical presentations \u2013 in English \u2013 at the World Heritage sites where \u201c history \u201d has become clean , technological , and a patriotic celebration of national achievement .\nJapan \u2019 s model of war production was exemplified by Mitsubishi \u2019 s Nagasaki Shipyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Second World War .\nDuring the Pacific War ( 1937 to 1945 ) the Nagasaki Shipyard built 72 warships and 15,000 torpedoes .\nMitsubishi turned the entire metropolitan region around Nagasaki city into a military-industrial complex with over 24 industrial and technical facilities , using thousands of Korean forced laborers and Allied POWs as slave laborers , including Australian POWs who produced materials for the Nagasaki Shipyard at Mitsubishi \u2019 s nearby foundry in the Urakami District.26 Mitsui had returned to its labor system using prisoners , but a new type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave labor that had its origins during the early years of Meiji of convicts .\nPOWs at Fukuoka 17 \u2013 Japan \u2019 s system of slave labor from Burma to Omuta27 The Australian POW experience is particularly important for understanding how the major zaibatsu , particularly Mitsubishi and Mitsui , were instrumental to Japan \u2019 s war production and brutal occupation of East and Southeast Asia .\nMitsubishi supplied the merchant ships , known by POWs as \u201c hell ships \u201d , that transported POWs from camps on the Thai-Burma railway construction ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , via Singapore , to Japan .\nMitsubishi also supplied cross ties for the Thai-Burma rail construction.28 Australian POWs on \u201c The Line \u201d \u2013 in terms of percentage of the Australian population \u2013 far outnumbered the British , even though more British soldiers were POWs there.29 By 1945 , the Australians outnumbered the British at Fukuoka 17 POW camp in Omuta , working in the Miike Coal Mine .\nMost POWs underground at Miike were Australians and Americans .\nThe Australians also appear to have led the resistance inside the mine .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger complex spreading across Omuta , with a rail , foundry , and port built by Mitsui .\nWhen Australian Private Roy Whitecross arrived at Moji port in northern Kyushu prior to the journey to Omuta , after years in Changi prison and on the Thai-Burma Railway construction with others from the AIF 8th Division30 , he wondered if conditions would be better as a prisoner-of-war in Japan .\nBut encountered conditions more deadly than Changi and in many respects on a par with

found the \u201c huts \u201d at Fukuoka 17 far better than what he and thousands of others had experienced while working on the Thai-Burma Railway .\nEach POW had their own \u201c mat \u201d ( tatami ) , blanket , \u2026 straw pillow .\nOverall he found the dorm room clean .\nThe tatami were a perfect accommodation for lice , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters were \u201c very good.\n\u201d But there was no heat , and winter snow at Omuta could reach over a foot , making the cold a serious health hazard .\nThe problem with the non-work environment centered on two issues : first , the food , which was meager and at times inedible ; and second , the constant harassment , regimentation , and beatings by Japanese guards .\nPhotos : Australian War Memorial : Entrance ( post-surrender )

the camp doctors .\nLike Runge and hundreds of other Australians at Fukuoka 17 , he had been stationed along the Thai-Burma Rail construction .\nHe had been beaten almost daily by Japanese guards while serving on \u201c The Line \u201d because he was the one who had to tell the Japanese who was too sick to go to work .\nHe got the blame , as they assumed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries qualified for time off .\nMalaria .\nberiberi , and dysentery didn \u2019 t count .\nConditions for medical staff were considerably better at Fukuoka 17 , including better hospital facilities , but medical supplies were virtually non-existent .\nHealth conditions were equally horrendous for those working in the mines .\nMalnutrition was so bad that men talked only about food , and they showed no interest in the Japanese women digging gun emplacements near the camp working with no tops during the hot summer .\nThe Red Cross sent food supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly stockpiled by the Japanese and not distributed to POWs .\nThey were discovered only after the surrender in August 1945 .\nRunge describes what rations were like at the camp mess hall : \u201c The rations consisted of a bowl of rice\u2026like a small pudding dole , very small , and \u2026 a couple of these pickles , like cucumbers \u2026 or seaweed .\nThat was to take down the mine .\nBut we used to eat it before we went down the mine .\n\u2026 Back in camp they \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs .\n\u2026 Back in camp , everybody traded .\n\u2026 You \u2019 d get somebody didn \u2019 t feel too well and they \u2019 d sing

rice now.\n\u2019 \u201d It was like a market , and those who traded but didn \u2019 t come through with their promised rations would pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c bankrupt \u201d by the other men , losing all their rations each day .\nA Dutch \u201c padre \u201d ( chaplain ) helped the \u201c bankrupts \u201d by providing them with minimal rations so they wouldn \u2019 t starve .\nThe \u201c cook house \u201d ( as Runge called it ) was run by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Edward Little , a man who routinely harassed POWs for what he considered poor behavior .\nThe Japanese camp heads put

.\nby Anthony Weller , First into Nagasaki : The Censored Eyewitness Dispatches on Post-Atomic Japan and Its Prisoners of War ( New York : Three Rivers Press , 2006 ) The Miike Mine had eight levels and ran two miles under the sea from entrances at Omuta .\nFukuoka 17 was actually built on land fill from mine slag .\nTemperatures underground ranged from freezing at upper levels to virtually boiling at the lowest level .\nThe miners often had to work with their legs submerged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on their \u201c G string \u201d before descending down the shafts .\nThis practice of wearing only a loin cloth went back to the early years of Meiji when the mine first opened and continued through the 1920s and 1930s .\nMiners \u2019 clothing of this type reveals how inadequate the ventilation systems were at Miike , even during World War II .\nBut the tunnels where the POWs worked were often ones Mitsui had abandoned in previous decades , with timber pillars rotting and cave-ins frequent .\nAmerican journalist George Weller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fukuoka 17 , on September 10 , 1945 , learned that \u201c [ b ] oth those Mitsui mines worked by Americans and those worked by Chinese are defective , \u2018 stripped \u2019 mines , dangerous to operate because their tunnels \u2019 underpinnings have been removed to obtain the last vestiges of coal.\n\u201d 34 David Runge and the other Australian POWs were also working in those mines .\nMen worked in tunnels but also in longer underground stretches \u2013 the long wall mining that began in the 1920s when technology made this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually with hand picks after dynamiting a section , and other times with pneumatic jackhammers .\nRoy Whitecross recalled \u201c twenty American prisoners \u2026 working a \u2018 long wall \u2019 [ with ] the roar of machinery and the clank of the scraper chain [ making ] speech all but impossible.\n\u201d 35 This was the undercutting machinery brought into the mine during the 1920s , one of the best indicators of \u201c modernization \u201d for any coal mine .\nThe coal was then loaded into coal cars ( skips ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to areas where the coal could then be loaded onto hoists that would take it to the surface .\nThe winding gear cables would sway back and forth across the low , narrow tunnels , forcing men to negotiate past the skips and tracks for the coal cars and tracking .\nDr. Ian Duncan found that many injuries were caused by these cables hitting limbs of the miners walking through these tunnels .\nDavid Runge \u2019 s interview of 1983 reveals the POWs confusion about how the shift system operated .\nAmerican POW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told George Weller , \u201c I \u2019 ve been working twenty-two months for Baron Mitsui .\nFour months was driving hard rock , and eighteen months was shoveling coal , twelve to fourteen hours a day.\n\u201d 36 Runge recalled that the POWs worked 12 hour shifts , but that these constantly rotated , giving the men just enough time to eat and then sleep .\nWhitecross explained how the rotating three shifts system operated : \u201c The first shift left camp at 4 a.m. and returned at four o \u2019 clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp at noon and returned at midnight , while the third , or night shift , went out at 8 p.m. and returned at 8 a.m. the following day .\nIn addition to these shifts , a permanent day shift carried out maintenance work at the mine .\nApart from a small number of men who worked in welding shops and other engineering plants , all shifts worked below ground in two sections , one working the actual coal and the other carrying out work incidental to the coal hewing , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting rock , and a dozen-and-one miscellaneous tasks.\n\u201d 37 The POWs had no free time , using every spare minute to try to sleep before returning to the mine , often on a different shift .\nIt appears that the work week based on constant rotating shifts \u2013 with no time off except every month or so \u2013 amounted to approximately 80 or so hours .\nIan Duncan said that the men working in the mine had to walk about a mile from the POW camp to the mine entrance for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exhaustion resulting was so severe that some men deliberately had other POWs break their foot , leg , or arm so that they no longer had to return to the mine depths .\nA zinc foundry was connected to the Miike complex .\nAccording to former Australian POW Tom Uren , he and the other POWs took a tram to the foundry , something the POW miners could not do on their trek to the mine pit .\nWorking conditions at the foundry were far better than down in the mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better jobs generally were held by POWs who had arrived earlier , particularly the Dutch .\nBritish POWs apparently were concentrated at the port loading coal onto ships .\nUren got a foundry job most likely because he arrived only months before the end of the war , having earlier worked at the copper smelting works of Nippon Steel Works ( which owned Yahata Steel Works in Kokura , another \u201c Meiji Industrial Revolution \u201d World Heritage site ) .\nHe too had previously been a slave laborer on the Thai-Burma Railway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThere seem to have been few deliberate executions at Fukuoka 17 ( such as beheadings or bayonetting ) , in contrast to POW camps outside Japan , especially in the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia .\nDeaths occurred from a combination of constant and severe beatings by guards and supervisors , disease from the terrible conditions and freezing weather in winter , and malnutrition that prevented recovery from disease and beating injuries .\nInfections were common , with medical supplies lacking .\nThe Red Cross supplied surgical instruments , sulfur drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other medical equipment and medications , but the Japanese prevented access to these , confining them to their secret storehouses .\nDr. Duncan believed that had these supplies been released , many lives could have been saved .\nToo often the POWs \u2019 experiences in Japan have been treated only as those of \u201c victims.\n\u201d But the Chinese forced labor response to Japanese authority in the Hanaoka Coal Mine uprising , escape , and subsequent massacre by the Japanese in Akita prefecture , northern Honshu , indicates a broader pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused particularly in the coal mines run by Japanese companies.39Australian Private David Runge \u2019 s account as a POW at the Mitsui Miike Coal Mine opens a new perspective on this resistance .\nHis background growing up in rural , agricultural Australia helped prepared him for the ordeals as a prisoner-of-war .\nHe was born in 1922 in Murwillumbah , New South Wales , a small town near the Queensland border ten kilometers from the Pacific Ocean coast .\nHe grew up in the town \u2019 s Solomon Row community , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and South Asian residents of color .\nHis father , Albert Ernest David Runge , was born in Denmark in 1898 .\nAfter coming to Australia , Albert married Florence Silva , who was born in Queensland a year before her husband .\nFlorence \u2019 s \u2019 father , David Silva , was born in Ceylon in 1846 , and arrived in Australia in 1881 , before the \u201c White Australia Policy \u201d excluded Asian migrants from entering the country .\nThe ancestry of Florence \u2019 s mother , Emma , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multicultural character of David Runge \u2019 s family heritage .\nHis mother died in 1931 when he was only eight , and his father seems to have vanished from his life at that point , leaving him in the care of his older sister May , who he listed as next-of-kin when he enlisted in the Australian Army in 1940 as \u201c Dave Runge.\n\u201d 40 He went to work after finishing primary school , and as a teenager became a driver at a local banana plantation .\nSouth Sea Islanders were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banana and pineapple plantations of northern New South Wales and Queensland .\nIn his 1983 interview , Runge told of how he enjoyed growing up in this community and how he identified as Australian .\nHe never made any mention of race or color in talking about his Australian upbringing , even though discrimination against anyone of color during those years would have been comparable in many ways to racial segregation in the United States , but not the extremes of the South .\nAfter he entered the Army , lying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seems to have found a new family and community , feeling a strong connection to his \u201c mates \u201d and a sense of responsibility as a soldier .\nAbove all , his story from childhood to the many experiences as a POW in Southeast Asia and then Japan , is one of survival and relying on those few he felt he could trust .\nDavid Runge \u2019 s view of the Japanese , in terms of their racism toward other Asians , was a revelation when he became a POW in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changi Prison .\nIt was a world apart from his roots in the multiracial Solomons Row community of Murwillumbah .\n\u201c I always thought Japanese were like us , when we fought \u2018 em .\n\u2026 Like their attitude \u2013 Japanese soldier and us .\nBut I seen enough in Singapore when they cut off people \u2019 s heads , and I seen a bunch of five or six Chinese women with their lips sowed up and dragged along the street by string , and these sorts of tortures that went on around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different attitude toward the Japanese then , don \u2019 t you .\nThe Asians thought that when the Japanese came down that [ the Japanese were ] \u2018 Asia for Asians.\n\u2019 But it was \u2018 Japanese for Japanese.\n\u2019 The Asians that spat at us and threw stones at us when we got taken prisoner , in the end they become to realize where their bread and butter was buttered , they kept waving flags secretly and putting up their thumbs in the \u2018 Hello Joe \u2019 sign .\nThen they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2018 Asians for Asians.\n\u2019 \u201d Photos from National Archives of Australia : David Runge \u2019 s Fukuoka Camp 17 POW card \u2013 reverse side lists previous POW camp on Thai-Burma railway construction and arrival in Japan by sea .\nBy the time he reached Fukuoka 17 , Omuta , and the Mitsui Miike Coal Mine on June 18 , 1944 he was determined to continue the fight .\n\u201c My attitude was to do everything in my power to cripple that coal mine.\n\u201d He acted on his own to sabotage production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coal mine and put [ it ] in the motors and chewed up the chain conveyor motors \u2026 when we was working in the laterals [ and ] digging.\n\u201d He also had a small group around him that worked secretly with other POWs who were American .\n\u201c My particular group was to look for coal , and when we found the coal we \u2019 d drill a long tunnel through the seam of coal and then the coal extractors would come and take all that seam out and that \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Australia .\nThe jackhammer used to weigh about 60 pounds , and the length of those drills is 13 feet .\nThe Jap \u2018 Mito Man \u2019 [ foreman with a nickname for \u201c dynamite man \u201d because he used so much of it ] that was in charge of us , he \u2019 d be drilling in like that and since he went in the depth he wanted in the face where we \u2019 re drillin \u2019 \u2013 instead of us saying with his hands \u2018 ok , move back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drill and pull it back , and we \u2019 d go falling back over rocks and everything .\nHe \u2019 d grab hold of it and pull it forward again , and we \u2019 d go slamming , trippin \u2019 over everything again .\nSo what I used to do , and what others did , was put a pick in the ceiling and pull the ceiling down on him , and bung him off , and then tell the \u2018 buntai jo \u2019 \u2013 that \u2019 s the Japanese foreman \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was \u2018 tenja cabina \u2019 \u2013 the word for cave-in , and we \u2019 d beat the Jap out.\n\u201d Runge continued the sabotage in other ways when he managed to stay on the surface for a short time .\n\u201c One time I put on a crook [ injured ] back , back in camp .\nThey put us to work topside in the mine workshops .\nMy job was to sharpen the diamond drills .\nYou had to put them in water or something like that to harden them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd of course they \u2019 d go down the coal mine and in five seconds they be turned to butter .\nAt times I find I \u2019 d be repairing the motors I \u2019 d put emery dust in.\n\u201d Secrecy was essential to conduct this sabotage , because the two main American officers the Japanese had put in charge of the camp , Little and Bennett , were known to collaborate with the Japanese .\nSome POWs also tried to gain favor with the authorities and could not be trusted .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian mates , including Roy Whitecross , and the man whose mat was next to his , John Towers .\n\u201c Down the coal mine I had a very bad name with the Japanese because whenever I worked in a group , say there \u2019 s five or six , my number in Japanese was \u2018 go-haku-go-jyu \u2019 , that \u2019 s five-fifty [ 550 ] , and [ they ] used to say \u2018 go-haku-go-jyu dunny door \u2019 , that \u2019 s \u2018 no good.\n\u2019 Because every time I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something went wrong .\nMe and a couple of Americans who were in on this sort of thing , of sabotaging the coal mine , we done it secretly because we didn \u2019 t want to reveal what we were doing , because there were people that were lovey dovey with the Japs and you didn \u2019 t know if they \u2019 d turn you in or not.\n\u201d Runge felt that Americans had the most in common with Australians among the POWs .\nFor him it came from an innate sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called \u201c race \u201d but actually was about class .\n\u201c Generally , apart from them two [ US officers Bennett and Little , viewed as collaborators with the Japanese ] , the Americans were \u2026 the same as Australians .\nLike the Japanese would call it \u2018 onaji , \u2019 means \u2018 the same.\n\u2019 \u201d He felt the Australians were very different from the English .\n\u201c The Australians and English don \u2019 t get along anyhow , anytime.\n\u201d His view may have been influenced by the relative absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group based mainly in the foundry , along with the Dutch .\nThese were the better jobs .\nBut the major differences seem to have been cultural .\n\u201c Like our humor is entirely different to English , Dutch , German , Russian , Chinese , Japanese , anything .\nOur way of life , our humor is entirely different .\n\u2026 But the Americans and the Australians , the humor \u2013 as the Jap would say \u2013 \u2018 onaji , \u2019 the same .\nThat sort of attitude with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another and it was a joke.\n\u201d Some of this related back to growing up poor and getting by in the years before the war .\n\u201c Australians and Americans , at that particular time come from pioneering families .\nLike the Depression , everybody came out of that Depression .\nA lot of people can remember that we had corned beef and damper41 and \u2026 syrup on the table back home .\nAnd so did the American boys .\nThey called their damper \u2018 corn bread \u2019 or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upbringing .\nSo therefore we got on well together.\n\u201d The Allied POWs were kept separate from the Korean and Chinese forced laborers .\nThe Chinese were treated the worst of any group and experienced the highest death rates .\nBut in the mine this separation could not always be enforced .\nRoy Whitecross recalled a chance encounter , clearly against company rules , with a Korean miner .\nKorean forced laborers and Allied POWs would be severely punished if caught fraternizing.42 \u201c One night I was sent to the main tunnel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hard clay used for tamping the dynamite in the holes drilled in the rock or coal face .\nAt the truck of dargo I found a Korean on a similar errand .\nHe looked carefully at me , then up and down the tunnel .\nIt was deserted .\nApparently he had not been long in Japan either .\nHis Japanese was halting and slow , and I understood him .\nI indicated that I did not understand his remark that Australians and Koreans were the same .\nHe answered : \u2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 Keeping a furtive look out for any approaching miners , he unburdened his heavy heart .\n\u2018 Nippon , no good .\nVery little food .\nKorea , plenty food .\nAustralia ?\n\u2019 He shook his head dolefully , and reaffirmed his belief that Nippon was definitely \u2018 no good.\n\u2019 In the distance along the main tunnel a miner \u2019 s lamp appeared .\nHastily assuring me that Koreans and Australians were the same and that they were \u2018 friends \u2019 he grabbed his sack of dargo and hurried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 One act of sabotage Runge and his group carried out involved a character they called \u201c Pinto Rice.\n\u201d From his 1983 interview it is probable that \u2018 Pinto \u2019 was Japanese .\n\u2018 Pinto Rice \u2019 could have been a play on \u2018 Binto box \u2019 , Runge \u2019 s way of saying bento box , used by the Japanese for the POWs \u2019 rice ration .\nOr it could simply have been taken from \u2018 pint-a-rice \u2019 , the standard small ration , and perhaps this man was small in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Japanese foreman this one day told him that if his group loaded extra skips full of coal that they could have a shushin \u2013 quick nap .\nRunge \u2019 s team followed through , but then the foreman refused and wanted more skips loaded .\nRunge got into an argument with him , to no avail .\nHis team then loaded more extra skips , but the system of moving the coal cars along the track incline required stopping at a certain point .\n\u201c [ This Japanese foreman ] used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full cars .\nAnd as he went down that tunnel , and as he went past \u2013 there \u2019 s a button on the wall \u2013 he \u2019 d hit that and \u2026 the red light \u2019 d flash up where this \u2018 Pinto Rice \u2019 [ worker ] was at the top , and [ Pinto would ] put on the brake and stop it .\nThe [ foreman ] would connect the other full cars and they \u2019 d pull them up into the main line .\nSo [ the foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as they went down the cable \u2026 he \u2019 d hit that , the red light \u2019 d go on and Pinto would put on the brake .\n\u201c When [ the foreman ] went away [ after the argument ] , I raced up to this \u2018 Pinto Rice \u2019 , and I said , \u2018 Now when he goes down with those two full cars and he hits that button , don \u2019 t stop it .\nBecause he \u2019 d be ridin \u2019 in the front , see.\n\u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he come and he hooked on these two full cars , took \u2018 em out and changed the points , and then he had to go down the slope , down underneath .\nWe seen the red light glow through the tunnel when he hit the thing .\nPinto didn \u2019 t stop it , and that drove him clear into the coal face .\n\u201c We had to go down there , and \u2026 we dug him out of the coal , and he \u2019 s still alive .\nHis pelvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug him out , and the Jap [ Pinto \u2013 as the foreman was unable to talk after his injury ] told us to take him up topside .\nSo he [ presumably Pinto ] said , look , we got to kill this bugger before we get him up topside , otherwise he \u2019 s going to squeal , you know .\nHe \u2019 s going to tell .\nSo we threw him [ the foreman ] over tops of coal trucks , down there .\nFell down on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t just die.\n\u201d Another foreman ranked higher than the injured man arrived and organized the men to take him up to the surface and then to the hospital .\nRunge and the POWs feared that the injured foreman would tell what actually happened , that the accident was deliberate .\nBut the foreman was unable to speak and eventually died , saving Runge and the POW rebels \u2013 and Pinto \u2013 from brutal punishment .\nOn February 12 , 1945 Runge \u2019 s luck ran out .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leader of a team of Australian POWs who had just arrived at the camp .\nThey were inexperienced compared to Runge and the others who had been there a year , and they were the type of POWs Runge did not trust , men he differentiated as \u201c new \u201d versus his \u201c old \u201d crowd that he felt he could rely on .\nTo help these new Australian POWs , he told them not to work too hard .\nBut there had been coal car derailments that day , making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team had been clearing rocks rather than loading coal , and the foreman was dissatisfied with their rate of work as well .\nTwo of the new Australians were pulled aside , and they revealed to the foreman that Runge advised them not to go too fast .\nBut more was involved than just Runge \u2019 s go-slow advice , as he had secretly been carrying out a particular form of sabotage .\n\u201c There was a couple of Americans and me .\n\u2026 We sabotaged the mine as much as we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could destroy , to knock down their production .\nThis particular time I told these guys that was with me \u2013 and they were new Australians , I was the senior guy .\nWhen we used to load these rock cars , the coal cars , I used to get all the rocks and stand them up perpendicular \u2026 so it looked like a full car .\n\u201c Anyhow one of these flamin \u2019 coots [ actually two , according to Runge \u2019 s affidavit for War Crimes trials ] went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we got into topside they called me out .\nIt was snowing , really snowing , and they got me and this American .\nThey hit the American fair across the mouth , and he went down , which I shoulda went down .\nBecause once \u2026 the American \u2026 went down they let him alone .\nThey got hold of me , they put me up on a box , and tied me thumbs up on a rope , kicked the box from underneath me and wacked me with sticks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched him through deep snow and took him to the prison cell , known as the aeso to the POWs .\nHe was forced to kneel on bamboo slats placed on the cold concrete floor .\n\u201c This [ guard ] used to come and stand on me thighs and squash me legs into the bamboo .\nIf you can realize the bamboo was about four inches in diameter .\nI had to kneel .\nThere \u2019 s one [ bamboo piece ] forward , and the other [ bamboo piece ] was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended on that above the ground in the kneeling position .\nThe Sailor [ Takeda Sadamu ] used to come and stand on me thighs to push that into me shins .\nI \u2019 d be kneeling down and they \u2019 d say \u2018 Stand up !\n\u2019 And I \u2019 d stand up .\nWith the soreness you \u2019 d start to get cold again .\nThey \u2019 d say \u2018 Kneel down again !\n\u2019 And they \u2019 d kneel me in again .\nAt night time they \u2019 d stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning they \u2019 d come along and kick us in the ribs , get us up again , and straight back onto the bamboos .\nIn the end I couldn \u2019 t stand up.\n\u201d This torture continued for five days , the first two without food or water , and with only thin clothes in the bitter cold of the prison room .\nFinally two POW orderlies took Runge to the camp hospital .\nDr. Ian Duncan found Runge \u2019 s legs were frozen solid .\nAfter several days gangrene set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to amputate his legs , but could only do it with a common saw .\nFortunately Runge was given a spinal injection that made everything from his waist down numb , but he could still hear the saw cutting through his legs .\nEven as he recovered from this horrendous torture the drama was not yet over .\nAn American POW , orderly Bill Zumar , took Runge to a separate room in the hospital a few days after the operation .\nZumar was from the town of Comanche , Oklahoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land grant after Indian removal from the Southeast before the Civil War .\nWhether Zumar was Chickasaw , Cherokee ( the largest Oklahoma tribe ) , or not , he talked to Runge like a Native American who knew when one had to fight to survive .\n\u201c He said \u2018 Dave , do you know why they put you in here ?\n\u2019 None of us ever told lies to one another .\nNo prisoner lies to one another .\n\u2026 [ I said ] \u2018 No.\n\u2019 \u2018 Because the Japs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you \u2026 I brought you this piece of iron .\nNow when the Jap makes a swing at you , goes with the bayonet , knock it aside real quick and hit him over the head , and take his rifle and you might be able to shoot a couple of them before they kill you.\n\u2019 Well you can imagine you \u2019 d be in that situation , you got no legs , you know you really and truly got to sit there and take it .\n\u2026 \u201c One particular day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this passageway .\n\u2026 They had rifles and fixed bayonets .\nI thought , well this is it .\nI took a solid grip on this iron bar behind me back .\nThere was Dr. Hewlett and Dr. Duncan standing there .\nAnd I thought to me self , they \u2019 re going to bayonet me and these doctors are going to pronounce me dead .\n\u201c They had bayonetted an American between the huts .\nThey gave him a cigarette and so they bayonetted him in the back .\n[ That ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Japanese captain [ Isao Fukuhara ] said \u2026 to Dr. Duncan and Hewlett , \u2018 You giving this man extra rations ?\n\u2019 \u2013 in Japanese .\nThey said yes .\nHe said , \u2018 Well you give him food , make him strong.\n\u2019 They said ok \u2013 and they all turned around and went out of the thing , and I was moved back into the ward .\nThat was a hairy experience , I tell you.\n\u201d The presence of Duncan and Hewett probably prevented further harm to Runge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they too would have had to be killed to hide Runge \u2019 s murder .\nCaptain Fukuhara , who ran the camp , had authorized Runge \u2019 s torture .\nHe was tried after the war and executed , along with three other guards who were at Fukuoka 17 and the Miike Coal Mine , including his main torturer , \u2018 The Sailor \u2019 ( Takeda ) .\nFukuoka 17 was finally liberated in September 1945 , over a month after the official surrender .\nThe Nagasaki atomic bombing , visible from Omuta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital ship needed to accommodate the prisoners-of-war , delaying access to POW camps beyond the city .\nAll the POWs who saw Nagasaki on their return were shocked at the devastation , but no one knew anything about the dangers of radiation at that time .\nThe full impact of the atomic bombing was not understood by any of the POWs , who believed that the destruction of Nagasaki contributed to their liberation .\nSome at Fukuoka 17 later learned about what atomic warfare meant and the terrible loss of civilian life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fukuoka 17 POW from Australia , was one , and as a result of what he saw firsthand in Nagasaki became an activist for peace later in life , and a leader in the Australian Labor Party as an elected MP and by the mid-1970s the deputy leader of the ALP .\nDavid Runge returned to Australia , and in the following years was fitted with prosthetic legs by Dr. Duncan , who had served with him at the Mitsui Miike Coal Mine POW camp .\nHe moved to Auburn , a suburb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and a new community .\nBut as Duncan related in 1983 , all the Australian POWs he knew from that time , including David Runge , suffered severe stress \u2013 what we now know as PTSD .\nBut David Runge , even in 1983 , still had a spirit of rebellion and sense of connection to his Army mates from those hard years .\nPhoto on left from Australia War Memorial : David Runge carried

the government .\nTo understand its real significance we need to examine how and why it was commissioned in the first place .\nHe Puapua \u2019 s origins can be traced back to 2007 when the UN adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indigenous Peoples , confirming the human rights affirmed in all previous international declarations , covenants and agreements belonged to Indigenous peoples as much as anybody else .\nIt confirmed the right to self-determination belongs to everybody .\nThus , in New Zealand , Pakeha have the right to self-determination , and so do M\u0101ori .\nAt the time , 143 UN member states voted for the declaration , including the major European colonial powers of Britain , Belgium , France , Spain , Portugal and the Netherlands .\nThere were 11 abstentions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , New Zealand and the United States .\nThey were especially concerned about the scope of Article 28 ( 2 ) which deals with compensation for confiscated or other dishonestly acquired land : Unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned , compensation shall take the form of lands , territories and resources equal in quality , size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress .\nNew Zealand was worried this article would justify returning much more M\u0101ori land than was already occurring under te Tiriti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlements .\nHowever , the phrase \u201c other appropriate redress \u201d is open to less restrictive interpretation .\nIn 2010 , the National-led government decided the declaration did not threaten freehold private property rights .\nThen-Prime Minister John Key argued : While the declaration is non-binding , it both affirms accepted rights and establishes future aspirations .\nMy objective is to build better relationships between M\u0101ori and the Crown , and I believe that supporting the declaration is a small but significant step in that direction .\nAustralia , Canada and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , New Zealand \u2019 s Labour-led government established a working group to advise on developing a plan for achieving the aims of the UN declaration .\nThese aims are not just concerned with land rights , but also with things like health , education , economic growth , broadcasting , criminal justice and political participation .\nHe Puapua , the group \u2019 s report , was provided to the government in 2019 .\nHowever , the government didn \u2019 t accept a recommendation that the report be promptly released for public discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was due to the risk it could be \u201c misconstrued \u201d as government policy .\nNevertheless , it has now been released and the government appears to have accepted the recommendation that M\u0101ori should be actively involved in drafting a plan .\nCollins also objected to the report \u2019 s description of this involvement as \u201c co-design \u201d .\nWhat she can \u2019 t say , however , is that including people in policy making is separatist .\nInclusion is an essential democratic practice .\nHe Puapua also uses co-design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social services and the protection of the natural environment .\nThis involvement isn \u2019 t new , but He Puapua says it should be strengthened .\nAnd while there may be arguments against this kind of inclusivity ( for example , co-design is a weaker authority than the rangatiratanga affirmed in te Tiriti ) , calling it separatist is an error of fact .\nRangatiratanga describes an independent political authority and is consistent with international human rights norms .\nIt has gradually influenced public administration in New Zealand under successive governments over more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are human rights arguments for strengthening and securing rangatiratanga .\nIn fact , the UN declaration may help clarify how independent authority might work in practice , especially in the context of the Crown \u2019 s right to govern \u2014 which the declaration also affirms .\nHe Puapua \u2019 s potentially most controversial idea involves creating \u201c a senate or upper house in Parliament that could scrutinise legislation for compliance with te Tiriti and/or the Declaration \u201d .\nThere are reasons to think this won \u2019 t get far .\nThe government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea was raised in just one paragraph of a 106-page report .\nBut its inclusive intent shows why \u201c separatism versus sameness \u201d is the wrong way to frame the debate .\nWhat it means to ensure all , and not just some , people may exercise the right to self-determination requires deeper thought .\nIn that sense , He Puapua might usefully be read in conjunction with British Columbia \u2019 s draft action plan on the UN declaration .\nReleased only last month for public consultation , the plan coincided with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement the declaration .\nThe British Columbian plan addressed four themes : \u2022 self-determination and inherent right of self-government Some of the plan \u2019 s specific measures are not relevant to New Zealand and some may be contested .\nBut its important general principles draw out some of the basic attributes of liberal inclusivity .\nThose include ensuring people can live according to their own values , manage their own resources , participate in public life free of racism and discrimination , and define for themselves what it means to enjoy social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s far-reaching proposals can inform New Zealand \u2019 s debate about what He Puapua \u2019 s proposals might mean in practice .\nAs I try to show in my book \u2018 We Are All Here to Stay \u2019 : citizenship , sovereignty and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , there are ways state authority can be arranged to reject the colonial assumption that some people are less worthy of the right to self-determination than others .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below @ @

in Brussels .\nIn its communique after the meeting on June 14 , it identified China as a \u201c systemic challenge \u201d to areas \u201c relevant to Alliance security \u201d .\nThe implicit message was clear : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean .\nAll of us who live close to the Pacific Ocean , especially in East Asia , should be deeply concerned .\nIf Nato comes to the Pacific , it only means trouble for us .\nWhy ?\nThree reasons .\nFirst , Nato is not a geopolitically wise organisation .\nIt did a brilliant job in the Cold War , deterring Soviet expansion into Europe .\nDuring the Cold War , it was careful and restrained , building up military capabilities and avoiding direct military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago .\nIn theory , after \u201c mission accomplished \u201d , Nato should have shut down .\nIn practice , it desperately looked for new missions .\nIn the process , it destabilised Europe .\nIt bears remembering that relations between Russia and Nato used to be much better , so much so that in 1994 , Russia officially signed up to the Partnership for Peace , a programme aimed at building trust between Nato and other European and former Soviet countries .\nBut things fell apart because Nato rejected Russia \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new members in its \u201c backyard \u201d .\nThen , in April 2008 , Nato pushed things further , opening the door to membership for Georgia and Ukraine at the Bucharest summit .\n\u201c There is one thing future historians will surely remark upon , and that is the utter poverty of imagination that characterised US foreign policy in the late 1990s .\nThey will note that one of the seminal events of this century took place between 1989 and 1992 \u2013 the collapse of the Soviet Empire\u2026 Thanks to Western resolve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet empire collapsed without a shot , spawning a democratic Russia , setting free the former Soviet republics and leading to unprecedented arms control agreements with the US .\nAnd what was America \u2019 s response ?\nIt was to expand the Nato Cold-War alliance against Russia and bring it closer to Russia \u2019 s borders.\n\u201d The result was inevitable .\nRussia had tried to be a friend of the Nato countries after the Cold War ended .\nInstead , it was slapped in the face with Nato expansion .\nMany Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerent , aggressive actor \u201d .\nThey fail to mention that Nato actions generated this response .\nA truly dangerous moment surfaced in 2014 when it looked as if Nato was about to encroach into Ukraine with the ouster of its pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych by Western-supported demonstrators .\nFor President Vladimir Putin , that was the last straw , and soon after came the seizure of Crimea , which the Russians consider part of their cultural heartland .\nThe dangers of Western expansion into Ukraine were well known .\nDr Henry Kissinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a country with a complex history and a polyglot composition .\nThe Western part was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939 , when Stalin and Hitler divided up the spoils .\nCrimea , 60 per cent of whose population is Russian , became part of Ukraine only in 1954 , when Nikita Khrushchev , a Ukrainian by birth , awarded it as part of the 300th-year celebration of a Russian agreement with the Cossacks .\nThe west is largely Catholic ; the east largely Russian Orthodox .\nThe west speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAny attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other \u2013 as has been the pattern \u2013 would lead eventually to civil war or break-up .\nTo treat Ukraine as part of an East-West confrontation would scuttle for decades any prospect to bring Russia and the West \u2013 especially Russia and Europe \u2013 into a cooperative international system \u201d .\nSadly , since 2014 , Ukraine has become a divided country .\nIf Nato had shown greater geopolitical restraint , these problems could have been avoided .\nThe second major weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour reflects the old adage : If you are a hammer , every problem looks like a nail .\nCuriously , during the Cold War , Nato dropped very few bombs on foreign countries .\nSince the end of the Cold War , Nato has dropped a massive amount of bombs on many countries .\nBetween March and June 1999 , Nato bombing campaigns were estimated to have killed 500 civilians in the former Yugoslavia .\nNato also dropped several thousand cluster bombs there , despite their use being illegal under the 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air strikes in Libya in 2011 resulted in 7,700 bombs dropped , and killed an estimated 70 civilians .\nMany of the bombing missions were illegal under international law .\nI vividly remember having dinner at the home of a former Canadian diplomat in Ottawa when Nato decided to bomb Yugoslav forces in 1999 .\nThis Canadian diplomat was deeply worried .\nSince this military campaign was neither an act of self-defence nor authorised by the United Nations Security Council , it was clearly and technically illegal under international law .\nIndeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special prosecutor in the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia , tried to investigate whether Nato committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia .\nEven though most Nato countries believe in the sanctity of international law , they applied so much political pressure that Ms Del Ponte could not carry out her investigations .\nEven worse , Nato has often started a military campaign and then walked away from the disastrous consequences of its intervention .\nLibya is a classic example of this .\nThe Nato countries were exultant when Muammar Gaddafi was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country split apart and became caught up in a civil war , Nato just walked away .\nMany years ago , a wise former US secretary of state , Mr Colin Powell , warned against such military interventions by citing a common statement in crystal shops : \u201c If you break it , you own it.\n\u201d Nato failed to own the wreckage it left behind .\nThis leads to the third danger : East Asia has developed , with the assistance of Asean , a very cautious and pragmatic geopolitical culture .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cold War , Nato has dropped several thousand bombs on many countries .\nBy contrast , in the same period , no bombs have been dropped anywhere in East Asia .\nThis is therefore the biggest danger we face in Nato expanding its tentacles from the Atlantic to the Pacific : It could end up exporting its disastrous militaristic culture to the relatively peaceful environment we have developed in East Asia .\nIndeed , if Nato was a wise , thinking and learning organisation , it should actually be studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of preserving peace \u2013 and learning lessons from it .\nInstead , it is doing the opposite , thereby creating real dangers for our region .\nIn view of the risks to East Asia through the potential expansion of Nato culture , all of East Asia should speak with one voice and say no to Nato .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article

from a developing nation , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being poised to surpass the US and the West in general .\nChina \u2019 s rise has also meant the rise of Asia and beyond as it builds an alternative to the so-called \u201c rules-based international order \u201d created by and exclusively for the US and its Western allies .\nChinese President Xii Jinping \u2019 s speech commemorating the 100 year anniversary of the CPC was devoid of self-proclaimed \u201c global leadership \u201d and instead focused on strengthening China internally while constructively contributing to the world abroad , mentioning its massive infrastructure building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road \u2013 by name .\nPresident Xi Jinping also noted China \u2019 s transformation from , \u201c a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy.\n\u201d Indeed , China today is not the China of Mao Zedong , nor the China of 100 years ago , though the Western media has worked hard to convince global audiences otherwise \u2013 attempting to reinforce not only the most negative prejudices held toward China , but also the most inaccurate ones .\nPresident Xi Jinping \u2019 s speech and related activities to the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of topics .\nCelebrations and performances noted China \u2019 s progress in everything from manufacturing , energy production , and infrastructure , to space exploration , poverty reduction , and the development of China \u2019 s armed forces .\nIndeed , China has accomplished for its 1.4 billion citizens as well as for its friends and allies abroad feats in the realm of development , peace , and stability unrivaled by the West .\nYet Western media coverage appeared fixated on a single sentence taken from an over 5,000 word speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c CCP 100 : Xi warns China will not be \u2018 oppressed \u2019 in anniversary speech , \u201d would begin by stating : China \u2019 s President Xi Jinping has warned that foreign powers will \u201c get their heads bashed \u201d if they attempt to bully or influence the country .\nThe quote was meant to provoke Western audiences , many of whom are guided by their respective media outlets of choice to adopt a sense of superiority and to feel threatened by China \u2019 s successes .\nIt was also meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China as a threat to global peace and stability , leading audiences to see the quote as threatening to \u201c bash \u201d the heads of anyone who now tries to hold China accountable .\nDeliberately omitted by the BBC was any context related to President Xi Jinping \u2019 s or China \u2019 s well-founded concerns regarding foreign powers who at one point in China \u2019 s recent history , colonized sections of its territory with Hong Kong being handed back over to China by

Beijing and to contain the rise of China .\nChina \u2019 s humiliation by the West lasted nearly a century and in many ways still continues \u2013 albeit in an ever diminishing capacity .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meng Wanzhou in 2018 by Canadian police at the direction of the US government over alleged violations of illegal US sanctions against Iran serves as a pertinent example of this continued campaign by the West to exercise \u201c domination \u201d over China and to humiliate it and its people at every juncture .\nThe BBC in its article also claimed that China \u201c has repeatedly accused the US of trying to curb its growth , \u201d as if to suggest Beijing is imagining this rather than it being a central theme of US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general .\nUS documents such as the declassified \u201c U\u042b Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific , \u201d released as part of the Trump White House archives , explicitly state that US objectives in Asia include maintaining \u201c US strategic primacy in the Indo-Pacific region , \u201d and to \u201c promote a liberal economic order while preventing China from establishing new , illiberal spheres of influence.\n\u201d In reality , US President Donald Trump \u2019 s desire to maintain primacy over Asia ( including China ) was carried over from the Obama Administration \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been ongoing for decades \u2013 articulated as early as the 1960 \u2019 s in the \u201c Pentagon Papers.\n\u201d And it is a policy that continues today .\nCurrent US President Joe Biden in his \u201c remarks on America \u2019 s place in the world , \u201d would claim that \u201c American leadership \u201d must meet \u201c advancing authoritarianism , including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States.\n\u201d How else would either Trump \u2019 s or Biden \u2019 s stated objectives be met besides \u201c curbing China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what US sanctions , kidnapping industry leaders , destabilizing Chinese allies , and its growing propaganda war against China itself all aim to achieve \u2013 curbing China \u2019 s growth .\nThe US along with its G7 allies now find themselves not only being surpassed by China , but engaged in a campaign of geopolitical bullying with a nation increasingly able to fight back .\nChina understands that \u201c the West \u201d is not merely Wall Street , Washington , London , and Brussels .\nIt is a region including hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be potential partners in building a new multipolar world order where national sovereignty \u2013 not a self-appointed international arbiter composed of elite special interests \u2013 holds primacy .\nToward that end , China has exercised patience .\nChina \u2019 s rise beyond the reach of these fading special interests is inevitable .\nChina has a population 4-5 times larger than the US .\nIt \u2019 s population is hardworking and well-educated .\nChina produces millions more graduates in the fields of science , technology , engineering , and mathematics than the US does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will directly contribute to research and development , technological innovation , improved manufacturing and the overall expansion of China \u2019 s already massive industrial capacity , as well as the construction of essential infrastructure both at home and abroad as part of the OBOR initiative .\nChina is already counted by the nations of Asia as a leading trade partner and investor .\nEven nations like Australia and New Zealand find themselves pivoting eastward , placing economic development ahead of traditional political alliances .\nAustralia \u2019 s leadership is attempting to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus self-inflicted economic hardship on its population .\nNew Zealand has performed a much more graceful balancing act to its own benefit while setting a precedent for others to follow , including for Western nations .\nChina \u2019 s naval forces are already larger than the United States \u2019 \u2013 with the rest of its armed forces more than capable of defending against any Western aggression against it in its own territory .\nAnd while the Western media continues to cite the threat of China using military force to \u201c take \u201d Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region \u2013 found itself tied economically to the mainland \u2019 s rise .\nTaiwan is additionally a territory of China and the people of Taiwan share a common fate with the mainland .\nIt is China \u2019 s rise that propels Taiwan \u2019 s economy , not trade with the West .\nThis is a trend that will only continue well into the foreseeable future .\nLooking at these fundamentals , what can the US and its partners do to \u201c maintain primacy \u201d over the \u201c Indo-Pacific region \u201d and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to use sanctions , political subversion \u2013 both within and along China \u2019 s borders \u2013 and even military aggression by proxy or directly \u2013 US leadership appears not to have considered whether or not the premise of maintaining primacy over a nation with a larger population and soon to have a larger economy was ever sound to begin with .\nThe celebration of the CPC \u2019 s 100 year anniversary and all that China \u2019 s government and people have achieved in the past century is a story that does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deride these accomplishments and to add fuel to a propaganda war being used to undo these accomplishments .\nThe story of China \u2019 s rise will not only be about how it went an impoverished , humiliated colony of Western powers to a global superpower , and perhaps even the premier global superpower \u2013 but also a story about how it has and will continue to navigate the dangerous , irrational policies of the West in its increasingly desperate bid to contain this rise .\nIt will also be a story about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s mistaken pursuit of unsustainable hegemony once its rise is complete .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons

Note on store front , Sydney , Twitter , July 10 , 2021 It is proving to be an unfolding nightmare .\nFor a government that had been beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months , insisting that people could live , consume and move about with freedom as health professionals wrapped themselves round the virus , the tune has changed .\nThe Delta variant of the disease has proved viciously wily in Sydney , New South Wales .\nAdmissions to intensive care units are growing .\nThe first death has just been reported .\nThe number of infections recorded on July 10 : 50 ; the number the next day : 77 .\nOf concern are the numbers of people who were moving in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious phase .\nOf the 50 reported cases on Saturday , 37 of those qualified .\n\u201c That is the number we need to get down to as close as zero as possible , \u201d statedan alarmed Premier Gladys Berejiklian .\n\u201c The only conclusion we can draw from this is that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n\u201d The 11am press conferences are proving grim affairs tinged by panic .\nThe questions asked are the same as those in other states in Australia where outbreaks took place .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people are permitted in your home ?\nOn each successive occasion , the Premier seemed panicked , even shrill .\n\u201c Zero means zero !\n\u201d she has stated at various points .\n\u201c No visits !\n\u201d The most telling element behind the surge of cases is the blithe approach taken to the health orders by the citizenry of Australia \u2019 s largest city .\nThis is understandable , given the erratic changes in Berejiklian \u2019 s approach to communicating health orders .\nWith an almost manic insistence on keeping areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused rather than clarified , hoping that the virus might be contained within various local government areas ( LGAs ) .\nErin O \u2019 Leary , manager of a caf\u00e9 in Newtown , noted in late June the distinct irony of having the front of her store in lockdown , and the back , not .\nAndrea Chapman , owner of a design store , had a few words of wisdom that might well be ringing in the ears of the Premier .\n\u201c Sometimes you \u2019 ve just got to hit everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we can move on.\n\u201d The Premier has been the victim of her own success , telling Sydney residents and those in New South Wales that the state was that different from the rest of Australia .\nThey were the \u201c gold standard \u201d to be emulated by all in terms of containing the pandemic .\nOn June 1 , the often fawning Herald Sun from the Murdoch press stable praised the Berejiklian government for getting everything right where its Victorian counterpart had failed .\n\u201c One state is NSW , led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of proportionality throughout the Covid crisis and has kept people safe while ensuring their livelihoods and liberties are not needlessly destroyed , the other is Victoria.\n\u201d Through that same month , as the Delta variant was starting to show heft , there was no reason to worry : sagacious Gladys had things under control , as did everybody else .\nThose in Sydney could use their highly attuned \u201c common sense \u201d and \u201c make individual decisions based on their own circumstances.\n\u201d On June 18 , she cautioned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , our strong preference is that you do not engage in any activity.\n\u201d Business owners were left to decide on how best to operate in the changing circumstances .\nEven as the virus had harnessed itself and trotted through the city , the Premier resisted any reference to the \u201c lockdown \u201d term , opting for the softer , milder \u201c stay-at-home \u201d order .\nLacking the necessary gravity to be persuaded , individuals moved about with liberty , dropping off children before heading to work , or continuing visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comically maternal , Berejiklian has been telling those in Sydney to be honest about where they have been for reasons of contact tracing .\nSome accounts supplied to the tracers have been inaccurate .\nChief Health Officer Kerry Chant has admitted \u201c having difficulty getting ahead of [ transmission ] chains \u201d .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t got time to waste unpicking stories , going back , cross-checking and verifying.\n\u201d Her advice : \u201c It \u2019 s critical that [ people ] tell the truth the first time.\n\u201d Parties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infringement notices have been handed out by police ( 167 of them on Friday alone ) .\nOn social media , the hashtag \u201c SydneyMockdown \u201d is trending .\nThe man behind Australia \u2019 s punchy response to combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic , Bill Bowtell , has been regular in his scathing assessments .\n\u201c Nothing like lockdown lite .\nNo outdoor mask mandate , retailing open and no kilometre radius restriction .\nNeither short nor sharp as in [ Western Australia ] or [ Queensland ] .\n\u201d The haphazard approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the government \u2019 s response to shopping and trading practices .\nThe decision to keep non-essential shopping outlets open , including large retail centres ripe for transmission opportunities , has meant free movement of both people and the virus .\nBerejiklian \u201c thinks people understand what is required \u201d ; a stricter enforcement of orders would produce unintentional \u201c suffering \u201d to those who \u201c can \u2019 t access something they really need \u201d .\nSimon Chapman , professor emeritus in public health at the University of Sydney , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not rocket science to show that a place with large numbers of people in it is going to be far more of a superspreading environment than a place with small numbers of people.\n\u201d Within the New South Wales cabinet are the business-as-usual types such as Treasurer Dominic Perrottet , who argued with colleagues that the lockdown should not be extended to July 16 .\nHe now concedes that the already extended lockdown may well have to move beyond this coming Friday .\nLooking wistfully at vaccination rates in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has this message for those in his state : \u201c We \u2019 ve got to get to a point where those who want to have a vaccine , get access to one .\nAnd at that point , we \u2019 ve got to open up our society , and have the freedoms that we had operating prior to the pandemic.\n\u201d Few would demur from this ; the problem lies in the former remark : access to vaccines .\nOn that score ,

the wrath of Australian censors .\nOver the years , the opaquely functioning Office of Film and Literature Classification has been guarding Australians like the children of Eden , fearful that their sensibilities might be corrupted .\nBut Australian politicians and various advocacy groups have broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet and how best to regulate both posted content and access to it .\nPornography features highly in this effort .\nIn April former opposition leader and shadow minister for government services Bill Shorten remarked to the National Press Club that , \u201c Children have too easy access to pornography in this country online \u2026 I think a lot of parents are oblivious.\n\u201d While not claiming to be a censor , he still insisted that children \u201c shouldn \u2019 t be getting their sex education from hardcore pornography.\n\u201d The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy and Legal Affairs is also exercised about the subject , having tabled a report in February 2020 asking the Digital Transformation Agency ( DTA ) , working with the Australian Cybersecurity Centre , to develop a regime for online verification that would limit access to such services as online wagering and pornography .\n\u201c These standards will help to ensure that online age verification is accurate and effective , and that the process for legitimate consumers is easy , safe , and secure.\n\u201d The report \u2019 s title is suggestive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age of Innocence .\nMuch material is marshalled against pornography .\nThe average age of a child first exposed to porn was somewhere between eight or 10 years of age .\nIts consumption led to harm , be it in terms of education , health , relationships and wellbeing .\nThe committee was firm in suggesting that the eSafety Commissioner steer the \u201c development of a roadmap for implementation of a regime of mandatory age verification for online pornographic material \u201d .\nThis would be \u201c part of a broader , holistic approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with online pornography.\n\u201d The government response to the report was made last month , supporting age restrictions on accessing such material \u201c in principle \u201d .\n\u201c The government is committed to protecting young people while safeguarding the privacy and security of people of all ages in an increasingly digital environment.\n\u201d An acknowledgment was made that technology could only be \u201c part of the solution.\n\u201d The response notes that parental engagement and education should also constitute a \u201c multifaceted approach \u201d in reducing \u201c the adverse effects of online pornography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is agreement \u201c that the Digital Transformation Agency is well placed to explore extending the digital identity program.\n\u201d The government \u2019 s initial focus \u201c will be to complete work underway that explores the potential for changes to the policy and accreditation framework \u2026 Depending upon the findings of this work , further technical interventions may be required.\n\u201d The DTA has been enthusiastic about the merits of its Trusted Digital Identity Framework .\nIn its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity does not involve a unique identifier , nor does it allow tracking of online activities .\nInstead , it provides a means for a person to authenticate their identity online.\n\u201d The eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant is now engaged in exploring various means of age verification , and promises results in this crusade to shield children from pornography .\n\u201c The last thing anyone wants is for this material , which is becoming increasingly violent and degrading towards women , or the less dominant intimate partner , becoming the de facto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children.\n\u201d The use of digital ID for reasons of verifying age is a subject of concern for the cyber fraternity .\nMatt Warren of RMIT University wonders if such policies might well encourage children to explore other realms of the digital frontier such as the dark web .\n\u201c Society norms wouldn \u2019 t apply there because they \u2019 re not regulated or policed.\n\u201d The problem would not only remain unaddressed but could be worsened .\nCyber expert Susan McLean , while not necessarily convinced that children would plunge into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fashioned parental guidance and restraint .\nAge verification measures , were they to be used , had to be more than mere box ticking .\n\u201c On its own , it \u2019 s not going to work.\n\u201d It needed to be supplemented by education .\n\u201c We need support for parents , we need education for parents.\n\u201d This firm push for regulating Internet content and access should also be read alongside the Online Safety Bill , which is directed at improving online safety through enlarging the cyber-bullying scheme to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than social media ; establish a adult cyber-abuse scheme , where material seriously harmful to adults may be removed ; and create an image-based abuse scheme , where intimate images shared without consent may be scrubbed .\nWhile the spirit of the scheme may be laudable , its effects are unlikely to be .\nSuch regimes tend to encourage the deletion of links relevant to sex education while restricting access to what are otherwise deemed legitimate services ( dating apps , escort advertising platforms ) .\nDigital Rights Watch warns that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites or maintaining subscriptions to adult content will fall within the remit of the eSafety Commissioner \u201c to tell you what you can and can not see.\n\u201d As with most measures tinged by moral outrage and paternalistic indignation , the outcomes of these policies may well prove not only self-defeating but even more pernicious than the ills they seek to address .\nBe wary of the law of

devastating product \u2013 the disease of COVID-19 \u2013 is indifferent to the fortress .\nSince Australia \u2019 s borders closed in 2020 the fortress formula has become an article of faith .\nInternational travel was halted .\nCaps were placed on returning Australians and permanent residents .\nArrivals were placed in quarantine for fortnightly periods in ill-fitted hotels .\nFor a time , the Hermit Nation strategy worked , if creakily .\nQuarantine breaches did take place with telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endured a lockdown lasting 112 impoverishing days .\nBut for the most part , breaches could be contained .\nContact tracing and surveillance was sharpened .\nA sense of hubris developed : the virus could be outwitted .\nThe country could bask in the isolation of \u201c COVID Zero \u201d .\nWhile Australia was fashioning its suppression and elimination strategy , its politicians became bullish and complacent .\nThe vaccine strategy , the crucial counterpart to containment , was neglected and left to wither .\nIn August 2020 , Morrison boasted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in the world to receive a COVID-19 vaccine , if it proves successful , through an agreement between the Australian Government and UK-based drug company AstraZeneca.\n\u201d That agreement , at least initially , was merely a letter of intent .\nThe government then thought it sensible to focus on

containing COVID-19 \u2013 the United States and UK foremost among them \u2013 showed greater prudence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmaceutical giants were drawn up to develop and manufacture a range of vaccines

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass vaccination centres should also be set up as a priority .\nThe pace of this \u201c boutique \u201d program was also affected by the bad press surrounding AstraZeneca \u2019 s

misfires in puns and insensitivity .\nMore practical approaches have come from outside government circles .\nFormer Prime Ministers have shown Morrison up .\nThe ever connected Kevin Rudd made his own intervention in lobbying Pfizer \u2019 s chairman Albert Bourla .\nThis effort was bitchily dismissed by Hunt and watered down by the Morrison government .\nRudd \u2019 s response was a snarl .\nHe

remittances are important .\nIt also hosts an American base where at one time India wanted to depute a naval officer to liaise with the US \u2019 Sixth Fleet within the framework of the Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China .\nSince when is it that India started losing sleep over the \u201c legitimacy aspect \u201d of other regimes ?\nThe \u201c legitimacy aspect \u201d is not even an issue in Afghanistan where the state withered away a long time ago .\nJaishankar probably doesn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting \u201d ministers .\nBecause , President Ghani keeps changing his ministers every now then according to to his whims and fancies and dares not seek parliamentary approval for his new picks , which the constitution mandates .\nIn fact , the current parliament , which is housed in a new building inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015 , itself has outlasted its term aeons ago \u2014 and in any case , no one misses legislative work in Afghanistan where power flows through the barrel of the gun .\nTake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe voter turnout in the 2019 election was roughly 1 million ( in a country of 40 million . )\nAt best , Ghani can claim he got somewhere around 5 lakhs votes in that rigged election , which was fiercely disputed by his opponent Abdullah who felt embittered \u2014 rightly so \u2014 that he was cheated out of victory .\nFinally , all the King \u2019 s men and all the King \u2019 s horses from Washington and other NATO capitals managed to reconcile the two Afghan politicians with vaulting ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula that was supposed to be an interim arrangement for creating the post of a prime minister for Abdullah , which Ghani coolly ignored .\nThis is , in a nutshell , the chronicle of Afghanistan \u2019 s current regime .\nThe international community looked away since it really didn \u2019 t matter who ruled as president in Kabul , since the real power vested in the hands of the American military commanders and some of Ghani \u2019 s closest deputies too were their creations , who plucked them out of thin air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catapulted them to the nerve centres of Afghanistan \u2019 s fearsome spy agencies .\nIt was a cosy arrangement as the gravy train puffing its way through the valleys and mountain slopes of the Hindu Kush was carrying tens of billions of dollars .\nSimply put , the Afghan ruling elite have had a whale of a time .\nThe interest groups on the American side also stood to gain out of nefarious activities ranging from prostitution to drug trafficking .\nRussia has repeatedly alleged that the US military personnel were directly involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Afghan elite prospered like nobody \u2019 s business and almost everyone has stashed away the loot in foreign countries \u2014 in Dubai or wherever .\nIn the bargain , corruption spread like cancer eating into the vitals of the state and the country has become notorious as the most corrupt on the whole planet .\nThe Pentagon \u2019 s inspector who audits the war and reports to the Congress has thrown up his hands in despair and admitted he can not possibly account for vast sums of expenditure in this 20-year war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just vanished into thin air !\nPerhaps , such venality is endemic to all armies and spy agencies fighting protracted wars and insurgencies far away from public view and are not held accountable .\nNow , this is the Ghani regime for you .\nJaishankar had no reason to have got emotional about the violence in Afghanistan .\nIt is a documented fact that the unofficial militia groups trained by the CIA and operating under Ghani \u2019 s security tsars and spy agencies have perpetrated such horrific crimes on the Afghan civilian population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read more And the curious part is that India has had no qualms about bonding with those Afghan tsars with blood on their hands .\nSuffice to say , Delhi either didn \u2019 t know what has been really happening in Afghanistan all these years and where the rivers of blood originated from \u2014 or more likely , it simply looked away because of some unspeakable congruence of interests .\nIndeed , violence has been a part of Afghan way of life for centuries .\nAs President Biden noted last week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state .\nAmazing , isn \u2019 t , that an American president would know Afghan history that an Indian foreign minister next door doesn \u2019 t seem to know ?\nThe crux of the matter is that it is not because of the graph of violence or the \u201c legitimacy aspect \u201d that Ghani refuses to give way to an interim government but the lure of power and the perks and privileges that goes with it .\n( By the way , Jaishankar \u2019 s argument about this \u201c legitimacy aspect \u201d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Unfortunately , some Pentagon commanders deployed to Afghanistan encouraged Ghani to be recalcitrant as their vested interests dovetailed with his and his circle \u2019 s .\nThe cabal in Kabul managed to hoodwink Barack Obama and Donald Trump .\nBut to its bad luck , Biden knows this war like the back of his hands and had once done his best to prevent the catastrophic \u201c surge \u201d in 2009 , even visiting Obama on a Sunday to dissuade him from that path .\nBiden is sensitive to the public opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw troops from Afghanistan .\nread more Afghanistan \u2019 s salvation lies in a quick transition to an interim government that includes the Taliban , as envisaged under the Doha pact , so that this brutal , senseless bloodshed can be stopped and negotiations can begin

and \u201c territorial integrity , \u201d the historical Treaty of Friendship , Cooperation and Mutual Assistance ( July 11 , 1961 ) between the People \u2019 s Republic of China ( PRC ) and the Democratic People \u2019 s Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of the relationship between these two states .\nAs one of the main alliances in Northeast Asia\u2014along with the US alliances with Korea and Japan\u2014their partnership has become a permanent fixture in the geopolitical landscape of the region .\nChina \u2019 s emergence as a great power and North Korea \u2019 s accelerated buildup of its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities has , however , made the alliance more significant as well as more complicated .\nAs the date for the treaty \u2019 s renewal draws close , how will this partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s extension mean for the future of the Northeast Asian peace and security architecture ?\nBoth countries may not entirely agree on clauses related to their mutual obligations , and Beijing will seek to redraw those provisions in its favor .\nWhile the value of the treaty is too important to both parties to let their differences significantly weaken it , this time around , the alliance is likely to face enormous challenges going forward .\nHow Relevant Is the Treaty of Friendship Today ?\nThe critical axis between Northeast Asia , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in bilateral relations over the past two decades .\nTensions have appeared in the relationship from time to time\u2014with debate on whether the treaty is \u201c outdated \u201d having emerged in Chinese media and strategic circles\u2014as the two worked to manage changing geopolitical circumstances and deteriorating ties with the United States .\nNonetheless , on May 27 , 2021 , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met North Korea \u2019 s new ambassador to China to reaffirm their \u201c traditional friendship , \u201d continued \u201c high-level strategic communication , \u201d and joint cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear up to celebrate the 60th anniversary of their alliance .\nCritically , Article II of the treaty codifies a China-DPRK collective defense commitment , explicitly obligating both states to take all measures ( including military assistance ) to prevent any \u201c armed attack \u201d by a state or an alliance of states .\nTo this end , Article III restricts both countries from participating in a bloc or action directed against the other ; simultaneously , the first clause of the treaty stipulates that the two countries will strive to \u201c safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the security of all peoples.\n\u201d Under the current circumstances , these clauses have become inherently contradictory .\nFor instance , to ensure peace in Asia and the security of all peoples ( Article I ) , Beijing has been forced to participate in actions against Pyongyang\u2014such as imposing sanctions on the North through the United Nations ( UN ) Security Council .\nChinese diplomatic and military analysts have , over time , also contended that Beijing is \u201c not obliged \u201d to help shield Pyongyang in the event of conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Beijing \u2019 s national security in jeopardy , thus breaching the common defense commitment .\nSince its last renewal , North Korea \u2019 s nuclear ambitions have tested the relationship over and over again .\nA key turning point in China-DPRK relations was October 2006 , when the North tested its first nuclear weapon .\nThis compelled China to sponsor UN Security Council Resolution 1718 , which imposed sanctions on North Korea for this action .\nThis resolution signaled a change in Beijing \u2019 s tone towards North Korea\u2014from discreet political aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint .\nAs Pyongyang continued to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies , further rifts have emerged .\nThis was especially evident in 2017 , when the DPRK \u2019 s aggressive nuclear and missile testing coincided with key Chinese events like the inauguration of Xi Jinping \u2019 s flagship Belt and Road Forum in May 2017 , the Xi-Trump Mar-a-Lago Summit in July 2017 and the September 2017 Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa ( BRICS ) Summit in Xiamen .\nThis was a particularly strained time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them closer to a \u201c tipping point.\n\u201d However , despite such tensions , the importance of strengthening the China-DPRK alliance has become secondary to their existing pragmatic economic and security ties .\nNevertheless , the legacy of their shared roots in \u201c Marxism-Leninism \u201d and the principle of \u201c proletarian internationalism \u201d have continued to underpin their interactions , as the two countries promoted inter-party relations alongside inter-state ties .\nMoreover , both states have deepened their commitment to regular consultations on matters of mutual interest under Article IV of the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at various diplomatic levels have strengthened the narrative that despite differences , the two sides are focused on \u201c carrying forward [ their ] traditional friendship.\n\u201d While the 2018 informal summit between Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping highlighted Beijing \u2019 s wish to play a \u201c constructive role \u201d in the future of the Korean Peninsula , the 2019 state visit by Xi to North Korea reassured Pyongyang of the \u201c eternal friendship \u201d the two states share .\nFurthermore , shared tensions with the US have tended to drive continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilateral frictions .\nTheir shared worldview\u2014primarily opposition to US efforts at regime change and promotion of human rights and democracy\u2014have been critical aspects of China-DPRK friendship , validating the relevance of the treaty in the years ahead .\nThe American strategy to influence the geopolitics of Northeast Asia through the security landscape and its dominant position in strategic institutions also encourages China and North Korea to stay united and achieve the goals of their partnership .\nFor instance , the May 2021 reaffirmation of their bilateral ties came after the US decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s development of ballistic missiles that can reach beyond the Korean Peninsula , which poses security challenges to both China and the DPRK .\nFor China , the treaty remains indispensable as an instrument enabling Beijing to sustain its engagement with North Korea and play an influential role in the affairs of the Korean Peninsula .\nChina believes that South Korea and the US expect to dominate the politics and ( perhaps ] unification processes of the Korean Peninsula , excluding Chinese participation .\nUnder such conditions , the treaty \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for China \u2019 s involvement in devising a solution to the Korean question by committing both states to a Korean unification solution \u201c along peaceful and democratic lines , \u201d in \u201c national interests of the Korean people , \u201d and that sustains \u201c peace in the Far East.\n\u201d With its delicate security balance , Northeast Asia is a critical region of interest to both China ( as its backyard ) and the US ( as home to its Indo-Pacific Command and its alliances with Japan and South Korea . )\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such regional dynamics , and its importance to China emerges from Beijing \u2019 s interest in maintaining its influence in this crucial region .\nThe historic meeting between South Korea \u2019 s Moon Jae-in and North Korea \u2019 s Kim Jong Un in April 2018 and the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace , Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula provided a diplomatic win in advance of US-DPRK talks but left China out in the cold .\nThe declaration itself only mentioned China in passing in a quadrilateral format and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape the Korean Peninsula \u2019 s future , making it a matter of strategic concern for China .\nA subsequent historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un in June 2018 further solidified the Chinese belief that the inter-Korean peace process would unfold with the US at the helm , reducing China \u2019 s long-held and well-established political power in Northeast Asia .\nUnder US President Joseph Biden , Washington has deepened its engagement with Seoul .\nBy settling the military cost-sharing issue , ending restrictions on Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding a successful Biden-Moon summit , the Biden administration has worked to repair damage inflicted on the alliance by the Trump administration , reset the bilateral relationship and shift the focus to bolster the alliance to confront challenges posed by China and North Korea .\nThe US has also completed its North Korea policy review and announced a new \u201c calibrated , practical approach \u201d to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , with an openness to diplomacy with North Korea .\nIt also made a surprise appointment of veteran diplomat Sung Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPRK at the Biden-Moon summit despite early indications the post would remain vacant for the near future .\nIn this political climate , with the renewed US focus on alliances in the region , the China-DPRK treaty becomes fundamentally vital for China to maintain its influence and regional stability .\nAs long as the US-ROK alliance remains strong , and the US continues its presence on the peninsula , the treaty will act as a counterweight to US and ROK influence in the region\u2014making its renewal a foregone conclusion .\nIn evaluating how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last renewal in 2001 , it is evident that , while the agreement is critical for both states , its renewal will present challenges .\nFor instance , in the context of Article II on military assistance , it remains to be seen whether China is willing to commit itself to the defense of North Korea , based on the conclusion that the North \u2019 s nuclear development has rendered the clause invalid .\nMoreover , according to the terms of the treaty , China is only obligated to come to North Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ; thus , Kim Jong Un could find himself without Chinese military assistance should he repeat the events of the Korean War when the North was the aggressor .\nIt is unlikely , however , that North Korea would support the treaty \u2019 s renewal without the military protection clause .\nBeijing considers stability on the Korean Peninsula an essential interest .\nIts support to North Korea guarantees a buffer between China , the South and US forces on the peninsula .\nHence , even though the Chinese are inclined towards a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest fear remains a collapse of the Kim regime , which raises serious concerns over the potential unification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korean control , the security of the North \u2019 s nuclear weapons stockpile , and a massive influx of refugees across the border ( China is already the first destination for North Korean refugees ) .\nTherefore , peace on the Korean Peninsula ( and , by extension , East Asia ) has become central to Xi \u2019 s Korea policy .\nA war emanating from the region could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other .\nWhile China has a rapidly expanding and modernizing military , it currently remains far behind the US in terms of both capabilities and , crucially , experience .\nBeijing \u2019 s foremost priority would thus be to avoid an unwanted full-scale war and may seek to amend or nullify Article II accordingly .\nBeijing has reportedly sought to revoke this clause to no avail , and has conveyed to Pyongyang not to count on Chinese military aid .\nFor North Korea , the treaty \u2019 s importance is based not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its largest trade partner\u2014accounting for 95 percent of the North \u2019 s total merchandise trade\u2014but also as a source of leverage in its negotiations with South Korea and the US .\nIn recalibrating the language in the treaty , North Korea \u2019 s aim will be to reaffirm its currently asymmetric relationship with China as the Biden administration amps up coordinated efforts with allies on North Korea .\nFor both China and the DPRK , their Treaty of Friendship remains vital as a tool for engaging with the US and ROK on more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable .\nWhile it is unlikely for significant changes to emerge from this year \u2019 s renewal , it will likely face major challenges over the next 20 years owing to changed political realities , opening the door to its amendment .\nAlthough China will not allow outside pressure to destabilize the regime in North Korea , it is an increasingly reluctant ally to the DPRK .\nMoving forward , Beijing will seek to redraw the treaty in its favor .\nHow the alliance evolves under this agreement over the next two decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim \u2019 s leadership .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us

seas and oceans of Asia , out to Africa and of course , deep into Southeast Asia .\nThe Southeast Asian leg of BRI consists primarily of a now-under-construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China \u2019 s Yunnan Province with Laos , Thailand and perhaps eventually Malaysia and Singapore .\nA large number of adjacent projects also are in the making and will complement other infrastructure projects recently constructed over the past decade or under construction now .\nThis includes various expressways , particularly through mountainous Laos which have already cut trips by road from days to just a day from China \u2019 s border with Laos in the north to the nation \u2019 s capital of Vientiane near the Laotian-Thai border .\nAdditional expressways are under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Laos .\nAnother expressway is currently proposed that will connect northern Thailand to southern China via Laos , cutting travel time between the two nations to just 2 hours .\nThe new road will connect with Chiang Khong district of Chiang Rai via the existing bridge over the Mekong River .\nThe 180-kilometre highway would allow vehicles to travel at 80 kilometres per hour and a drive from Thailand to China through Laos would take less than two hours .\nThe HSR line itself will include both passenger and freight services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landports \u201d to facilitate regional logistical operations .\nThe entire network is already under construction with Bangkok \u2019 s new Bang Sue Grand Station completed and ready to open this year , hosting Thailand \u2019 s high-speed trains in coming years , and the Laotian leg nearing completion with train services possibly coming online by the end of 2021 or early 2022 .\nCriticism for the network of transportation projects stretching into Southeast Asia , like criticism of the BRI itself , stem mainly from Western ambitions to prevent the rise of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of Asia .\nUS media sources like the US State Department \u2019 s Voice of America repeatedly floats accusations of Beijing employing \u201c debt-trap diplomacy \u201d while also admitting that Laos , until these projects began , was landlocked , isolating it from regional markets and preventing economic growth .\nIt \u2019 s obvious that Laos \u2019 current economy is not well-suited for paying off massive infrastructure projects , but the infrastructure projects will expand its economy up to and beyond levels needed to do so , which is the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place .\nOther cart-before-horse analysis includes claims that there is no market for HSR services across Southeast Asia and specifically in Laos or Thailand .\nThe same flawed arguments were made by bitter Western analysts in a bid to deride China \u2019 s own domestic HSR development .\nAnalysis attempting to conclude low-income passengers wouldn \u2019 t \u2019 be able or willing to pay for tickets to ride China \u2019 s HSR services missed the crucial fact that the building of infrastructure accelerates more than just passengers down a set of rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expands economic activity for a larger number of people and if extensive enough ( as China \u2019 s HSR network is ) it moves whole sections of society up the socioeconomic ladder .\nInitially low ridership was seized upon by Western pundits claiming China \u2019 s HSR ambitions were too big and the entire project was \u201c in trouble , \u201d as one Business Insider op-ed did in 2011 .\nNow in 2021 , Western pundits , despite China State Railway overseeing the nation \u2019 s HSR network regularly turning an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after over a decade of predicting failure that never materialised .\nToday , China \u2019 s HSR network moves between 2 billion and 3 billion passengers a year and reaches into the most remote areas of the nation ( with a leg completed in Tibet just this June ) bringing with it tourists , investors , businesspeople and opportunities hitherto out of reach especially for rural regions .\nInfrastructure comes first , prosperity follows .\nAttempting to claim infrastructure is ill-conceived because it won \u2019 t immediately profit demonstrates the exceedingly shortsighted nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of China \u2019 s government and apparently also of its partners in Laos and Thailand .\nObviously rural regions in Laos or in northeast Thailand will not find HSR services immediately appealing during the first years of operation .\nBut as economic activity flows through these regions made accessible to many more people both within Laos and Thailand and also from China , economic conditions will improve , and ridership will increase , just as it did in China .\nWith the prospect of this regional HSR network also moving freight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for businesses and farmers in these regions .\nFor the West , a tangible jealousy is manifesting itself as China builds infrastructure out of reach of even the richest Western nations .\nTo see

difficult to explain why Asia as a whole appears to be surpassing the West by a growing number of metrics .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western governments have mobilised opposition groups in Thailand in a bid to

respectively.\n\u201d China \u2019 s export-import trade with Taiwan , Europe , Africa , and Asia is thriving , and it is apparent from official figures that while the overall \u201c U.S .\ntrade gap narrowed to $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record high $ 75 billion gap in March \u201d the \u201c deficit with China decreased $ 7.1 billion to $ 32.4 billion as exports were up and imports declined.\n\u201d This

than previously assumed .\nExperts from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation obtained satellite images showing work underway on the construction of more than 100 new missile silos near Yumen .\nThe evidence , which dropped June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US national security experts \u2013 as might have been expected given Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin \u2019 s description of China as America \u2019 s \u201c pacing challenge.\n\u201d The discussion is still fluid , but two interpretations are emerging .\nOne offers that China is reacting to US actions and that Washington should pursue arms control with Beijing \u2013 negotiate to get both sides to limit their forces and avoid an arms race .\nThe other interpretation holds that the new discovery means that there is a nuclear dimension to Chinese President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have \u201c the dominant position \u201d in the world by 2049 , and that Washington should double down on deterrence , including by fully modernizing its nuclear arsenal and more .\nYet neither negotiating arms control nor strengthening deterrence is a straightforward solution \u2013 nor are the two necessarily mutually exclusive .\nThe Chinese nuclear arsenal , like other facets of Chinese power , is going to be an enduring problem for the United States .\nAs Admiral John Aquilino , the new Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command , put itduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c China is a long-term challenge that must be \u2018 managed \u2019 rather than \u2018 solved.\n\u2019 \u201d Anyone with a cursory knowledge of US-China strategic relations is aware that the United States is a major driver of China \u2019 s nuclear modernization program .\nBeijing is concerned by Washington \u2019 s nuclear superiority and its improved ability to find and destroy Chinese forces , or to intercept them with missile defenses .\nChina , plainly , fears that the United States might become capable of putting it in checkmate , achieving what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To solve that problem , Beijing has been expanding and perfecting its arsenal .\nIn addition to building more nuclear weapons , it is investing in road-mobile missiles and sea-based platforms because these systems make it more difficult for Washington to target its forces , and it is adding multiple independent re-entry vehicles to its missiles to penetrate US missile defenses .\nOf late , Beijing also seems to have embraced tactical nuclear use and nuclear warfighting options .\nIn unofficial dialogs , Chinese strategists make clear that China \u2019 s modernization program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by extension , its allies .\nCountering the United States and its allies is not the sole driver , however .\nIn private discussions , Chinese strategists confess that Beijing is increasingly motivated by nuclear developments in India .\nAs one such strategist explained : \u201c Beijing now regards India as a deterrence problem , not as a proliferation problem.\n\u201d Chinese strategists are less forthcoming when asked whether Beijing considers Russia when it does defense planning , but some admit it is a factor .\nWhile it is unclear if North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be foolish to assume that defense planners in Beijing do not also contemplate conflict with their nuclear-armed neighbor given their complicated relationship .\nFinally , analysts have explained that domestic and organizational factors are driving the Chinese modernization program as well .\nThe idea that a US push for arms control with China could solve the problem , then , is not obvious .\nIt \u2019 s also not as if the United States had never tried .\nSince the 2000s , Washington sought to jump-start bilateral nuclear dialogue with Beijing for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial \u201c patient \u201d approach nor , from the mid-2010s , its more confrontational stance , has yielded results .\nBeijing has declined to engage .\nThe United States could try harder .\nChinese strategists have long insisted that a US statement recognizing that the United States and China are in a situation of mutual vulnerability would help establish a foundation upon which US-China strategic stability can be built , despite the asymmetry of forces between the two countries .\nPut differently , a US \u201c vulnerability acknowledgment \u201d could entice Beijing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research currently conducted by this author , however , suggests that it is not a given and that , in any case , an agreement would not emerge quickly .\nSo deterrence will play an important \u2013 and possibly growing \u2013 role in US-China relations regardless of whether there is movement on arms control .\nThe deterrers , unlike the arms controllers , think that engaging China is pointless .\nThey believe that the latest news makes clear that China seeks nuclear parity with , perhaps even dominance over , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter with a major nuclear update .\nWithout minimizing the problem , maintaining perspective about China \u2019 s nuclear build-up is essential .\nThe US Department of Defense estimates that China \u2019 s stockpile is in the low hundreds \u2013 a fraction of the US and Russian stockpiles , which are in the low thousands .\nSo , neither a doubling , tripling or even quadrupling of China \u2019 s stockpile would come close to US and Russian stockpile levels .\nIt is also unclear whether China seeks nuclear parity or dominance .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest evidence may show Beijing playing a shell game \u2013 moving a small number of missiles across a big matrix of silos to prevent its adversaries from locating the missiles .\nIt is a possibility worth considering , especially given that the United States has systematically over-predicted the future size of the Chinese arsenal .\nMore problematically , focusing on the quantitative growth of China \u2019 s arsenal risks underestimating its qualitative improvement \u2013 which is where Beijing has made the most progress .\nA

first-user advantage against the United States .\nWhat is present , however , is a risk of nuclear escalation in a conflict .\nWith a more sophisticated arsenal , Beijing may become more aggressive at the conventional level , which could lead to wars and nuclear use .\nOne pathway to such use is a situation in which China is losing a war \u2013 for instance over Taiwan \u2013 and launches limited nuclear strikes to force the United States to give up the fight .\nAnother is a situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States hits Chinese nuclear forces with conventional weapons , prompting Beijing to go nuclear with its remaining forces .\nThis is not far-fetched given the increasing entanglement between Chinese nuclear and conventional forces .\nTo be sure , the open-ended nature of China \u2019 s nuclear build-up raises legitimate questions for the United States about nuclear policy , strategy and force planning , especially given that Washington , for the first time , faces two major

deterrence is also important because it provides an essential backstop to out-of-control escalation .\nBut doubling down on nuclear deterrence will do little to address the rising risk of conflict and

bringing nuclear weapons into Japanese ports for decades contrary to the government \u2019 s stated policies and public understanding.1 In fact , Reischauer had negotiated an agreement with Foreign Minister \u014chira Masayoshi in April , 1963 , to accept the transit of nuclear armed warships in Japanese waters which only formalized what had been going on already .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve long

the Diet in 1955 , states that \u201c atomic energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes , aimed at ensuring safety .\n.\n.\nand under democratic management.\n\u201d Its \u201c Three Non-Nuclear Principles \u201d resolution , passed by the Diet in 1971 , states that \u201c Japan shall neither possess nor manufacture nuclear weapons , nor shall it permit their introduction into Japanese territory.\n\u201d In his book The Doomsday Machine : Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsberg writes that \u201c in early 1960 I was told in great secrecy by a nuclear control officer in the Pacific that one small Marine airbase at Iwakuni in Japan had a secret arrangement whereby its handful of planes with general war missions would get their nuclear weapons very quickly in the event of a general war alert.\n\u201d Ellsberg goes on to explain how they would be deployed .\nBecause of the special relation of the Marines to the Navy , there was a flat-bottomed ship for landing tanks on the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tank ) , anchored just offshore Iwakuni with nuclear weapons aboard , loaded onto amphibious tractors , just for the small group of planes on this base .\nThe LST , the USS San Joaquin County , had a cover mission as an electronics repair ship .\nIt was permanently stationed not just inside the three-mile limit of Japanese territorial waters but anchored a couple of hundred yards from the beach , in the tidal waters .\nBy any standards it was stationed within the territory of Japan .\nSo were its nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The San Joaquin County would operate as it was designed to do in an amphibious landing .\nIt would haul anchor and come straight ashore .\nThe front of the ship would open up like a clam-shell , and amphibious tractors loaded

.\nIn 1967 it finally moved back to Okinawa.2 Ellsberg later wrote , \u201c There were major interviews in Japan after Reischauer \u2019 s revelations , in one of which I was paired with a retired general who had been in one of the highest positions in the Japanese defense establishment.\n\u201d Like other official spokespersons at the time , he maintained that the U.S. had assured the Japanese government they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of introducing nuclear weapons into Japanese territory .\nThis was in reference to nuclear weapons even aboard U.S. ships in Japanese ports , let alone permanently in Japanese territorial waters like the LST at Iwakuni .\nSince the U.S. had not made any such announcement to the government , the government assumed that no such introduction had ever occurred .\nEvery US sailor in a Japanese port knew that was untrue .\nVirtually every U.S. ship in a Japanese port had nuclear weapons aboard .\nBut did the Japanese government know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nMoreover , he said , they knew about the LST , and accepted it , so long as the U.S. kept it secret and denied it .\nOn the ports , the US always said \u201c We neither confirm nor deny the location of any US nuclear weapons.\n\u201d This declaration was largely to allow the Japanese government , in particular , to deny their knowledge and to lie about it.3 In an article headlined \u201c Japan reels under Reischauer \u2019 s nuclear \u2018 bombshell \u2019 \u201d ( Christian Science Monitor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey Murray wrote , Why did he choose now to make a statement like that ?\nIt \u2019 s incredible , beyond belief.\n\u201d The anguish in the voice of the senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official was obvious .\nHe was referring to claims by Edwin Reischauer , a highly respected former US ambassador to Tokyo and now a Harvard professor , that American warships carrying nuclear weapons had frequently entered Japanese ports or passed through territorial waters .\nRepeatedly over the years , however , the Japanese people have been assured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been \u201c clean \u201d in compliance with this country \u2019 s three nonnuclear principles \u2014 not to manufacture , possess , or allow introduction of nuclear weapons .\nIn fact , Japanese government officials have a long history of approving U.S. nuclear weapons deployments going back to 1954 when the crew of a Japanese fishing boat suffered severe radiation poisoning from the test of a hydrogen bomb in the South Pacific .\nThe March , 1954 \u201c Bravo Shot \u201d H-bomb explosion dumped radioactive debris on the Marshall Islands , U.S. servicemen aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon No .\n5 .\nThe multi-megaton blast infected Marshall Islanders with radiation sickness and caused cancers in the years that followed .\nTheir contaminated home on Bikini Atoll remains uninhabitable to this day .\nU.S. servicemen who had been purposely transported into the blast zone have suffered from multiple cancers from radiation exposure .\nFor years their claims were denied by the Veterans Administration .\nIt took an act of Congress in 1990 to provide compensation for

hull of contaminated Lucky Dragon No .\n5 at Yaizu City port , Shizuoka Prefecture , Japan .\nWith the Diet in an uproar over the H-bomb tests and the resulting poisoned fishermen , opposition parties demanded that the Japanese government bring the case to the International Court of Justice .\nOn March 17 , 1954 , Representative Kawasaki Hideji of the Progressive Party argued that \u201c world opinion would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now been victimized three times by nuclear explosions .\nOur foreign policy must be courageous enough to petition the International Court.\n\u201d Foreign Minister Okazaki Katsuo responded that \u201c I am confident we can resolve the issue without going to the Court.\n\u201d On April 9 , 1954 , Foreign Minister Okazaki explained his decision not to pursue America \u2019 s legal responsibility at a party in Tokyo given by the America-Japan Society .\n\u201c We recognize that nuclear tests are indispensable to the security not only of America , but of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we join the other democratic nations in helping to make sure the atomic tests are successful.\n\u201d 5 For his thoroughly researched article \u201c Japan under the US nuclear umbrella , \u201d Hans Kristensen drew on historical records and recently declassified documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that listed U.S. nuclear weapons deployments in Japan during the Cold War.6 There was in fact no such understanding .\nIn a secret letter on July 17 , 1955 , the foreign minister was officially informed by the Embassy that the ambassador \u201c made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic weapons in Japan \u201d and that \u201c the U.S. government does not consider itself committed to any particular course of action.\n\u201d In March of 1955 , one year after the crew of Lucky Dragon No .\n5 had suffered radiation poisoning from the Bikini H-bomb test , Prime Minister Hatoyama Ichir\u014d was asked at a press conference if he would permit U.S. nuclear weapons in Japan .\nHe responded much like Foreign Minister Okazaki Katsuo had the previous year .\n\u201c If we are to sanction the present \u2018 peace sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have to allow such stockpiling.\n\u201d To calm the furor that ensued , the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) insisted that Japan had an \u201c understanding \u201d with the U.S. that it would be consulted before such deployment took place .\nForeign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru told the Diet in June , 1955 , that there would be \u201c prior consultation \u201d with the U.S. if nuclear weapons were ever deployed in Japan .\nBut in a classified internal report in 1957 the U.S. State Department refuted this claim .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the Diet the U.S. would not bring nuclear weapons into Japan without asking first , Foreign Minister Shigemitsu sent a letter to the American ambassador John M. Allison assuring him that \u201c nothing in the discussions in the Diet commits the U.S. to any particular course of action.\n\u201d As noted by Hans Kristensen , \u201c This double standard policy of secretly relieving the U.S. from any obligations before bringing nuclear weapons in , while at the same time assuring the public that specific limitations existed , would become a trademark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d 7 On July 29 , 1955 , only eleven days after the State Department \u2019 s letter , the Associated Press reported a U.S. Army announcement that it was sending nuclear missiles and Honest John artillery rockets to Japan .\nThe report cited a \u201c heretofore secret agreement \u201d between the U.S. and Japanese governments permitting their deployment , but that \u201c the Diet had not been informed.\n\u201d The report made headlines in Japan .\nThe next day Prime Minister Hatoyama , testifying in the Diet , denied any knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no secret agreement .\nWithout mentioning an agreement , U.S .\nAmbassador Allison released a statement that the missiles and rockets would be sent to Japan minus their nuclear warheads .\nIn fact , the \u201c secret agreement \u201d between the two governments allowed for the positioning of the weapons and their crews in Japan with the understanding that nuclear warheads would be brought in if both governments agreed that the international situation required them.8 However , no such subterfuge was necessary when it came to Okinawa .\nA prefecture of Japan until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized by the U.S. during the Battle of Okinawa and ruled under U.S. military occupation until 1972 .\nThis allowed American forces \u201c freedom of operations \u201d unfettered even by the easily circumvented laws in \u201c sovereign \u201d mainland Japan .\nThe same day , July 29 , 1955 , that the Associated Press reported the U.S. dispatch of nuclear weapons to Japan , the Chicago Tribune reported that atomic cannons and nuclear-armed Honest John rockets were being deployed to Okinawa .\nAlthough the subsequent presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests that greeted the arrival of Honest John rockets showed that they were hardly a secret to Okinawans .\nHow could local residents not be suspicious of the extremely high security at the Army \u2019 s ordnance storage base at Henoko where squads of armed soldiers with German Shepherd sentry dogs patrolled its perimeter 24/7 , where signs along the main road passing it ordered \u201c no stopping , \u201d and where a large area of close-cropped grass surrounded by high-wire fencing contained several oblong , sod-covered concrete bunkers with steel doors ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ base \u2019 s \u201c SW \u201d designation on the sign at its entrance gate stood for \u201c special weapons \u201d \u2013nuclear , chemical and biological .\nAmong Okinawans inclined to do some research into nuclear issues , a book published in mainland Japan about the U.S. military in Okinawa noted that an unclassified Army manual describing the base \u2019 s organization listed a \u201c nuclear ordnance platoon.\n\u201d 9 Storage \u201c

occupation .\nOccupation officials promptly shut down the magazine for one year , confiscated issues already printed , and expelled Arakawa and his co-editor Kawamitsu Shin \u2019 ich from University

Okinawa were supposed to be a military secret .\nAccording to a November , 1999 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists , nuclear weapons had first come to Okinawa in 1954 .\nDeployment of complete weapons and components coincided with the U.S.-China crisis over the Taiwan straits in 1954\u201355 .\nThe Eisenhower administration , worried that Chinese forces might attack the offshore

Pacific\u2014at Okinawa , Guam , the Philippines , Korea , and Taiwan ( but not Hawaii ) \u2014totaled approximately 1,700 weapons .\nThere were about a dozen weapons on Taiwan , 60 in the Philippines

on-shore stockpile in the Pacific peaked in mid-1967 at about 3,200 weapons , 2,600 of which were in Korea and Okinawa.11 Stored with the Honest John rockets at the Army \u2019 s ordnance base in

with the host country .\nIn response , a meeting of officials from the U.S. military and the Atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced the \u201c Neither Confirm nor Deny \u201d ( NCND ) policy that remains in effect today.13 [ I ] t is the policy of the United States Government .\n.\n.\nneither to confirm nor deny the presence of the nuclear component of nuclear-capable weapons in any another country , and that this policy would be followed in the event that U.S. officials are queried with respect to any statement made by an official of a foreign country or by any other source .\nThe United States refused to agree to treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s approval for nuclear weapons deployments on land .\nIn April , 1963 it secured the aforementioned agreement from Foreign Minister \u014chira Masayoshi , with an exchange of formal letters , to accept the transit of nuclear armed warships through Japanese ports and territorial waters .\n( Kristensen ) This directly contradicted Japan \u2019 s 1955 \u201c Atomic Energy Basic Law \u201d that restricted nuclear energy to \u201c peaceful purposes ; \u201d and its \u201c Three Non-Nuclear Principles \u201d resolution passed by the Diet in 1971 specifying that \u201c Japan shall neither possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it permit their introduction into Japanese territory.\n\u201d Not limited to transit by ship , Navy records from 1963 and the 1972 interview of a former U.S. serviceman , published in the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper , indicate that nuclear weapons were delivered by air to U.S. bases in Japan .\n\u201c On a number of occasions over three years beginning in 1960 we carried B-43 small nuclear bombs and others from McCord [ Air ] Base in Tacoma , Washington to four bases in Japan : Yokota , Misawa , Johnson ( Iruma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] .\n\u201d 14 In March of 1961 with tensions rising in Southeast Asia over anti-government insurgencies , the U.S. Navy declared a DEFCON 2 alert , the condition immediately below the outbreak of war .\nNuclear-strike aircraft carriers USS Midway , docked at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan , and USS Lexington at Okinawa , were ordered to the South China Sea .\nThe Japanese government was already well aware of U.S. carriers \u2019 nuclear capability .\nOne month earlier , in February of 1961 , the Chief of Staff of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) observed a demonstration of \u201c special weapons delivery \u201d by U.S. Navy aircraft from nuclear strike carriers on a three-day cruise to Okinawa .\nBy this time Navy warships were routinely bringing both tactical and strategic nuclear weapons into Japanese ports well before the 1963 formal agreement from the Japanese government.15 In December , 1965 , a jet fighter carrying a hydrogen bomb accidentally rolled off the aircraft carrier U.S.S

was not informed of the accident at the time.16 By the mid-1960 \u2019 s protests in Okinawa against the U.S. occupation and its nuclear-armed bases were beginning to interfere with the functioning of the American military mission .\nMass demonstrations , including sit-ins at base gates and occupation headquarters , demanded a return of Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty , reduction of the U.S. military presence , and the removal of nuclear weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the \u201c Okinawa Reversion Agreement \u201d between U.S. President Richard Nixon and Japan \u2019 s Prime Minister Sat\u014d Eisaku , concluded in November , 1969 .\nPrime Minister Sat\u014d and President Nixon at the White House in November , 1969 The Japanese government had publicly pledged an Okinawa reversion with bases reduced to mainland levels ( hondo nami ) and without nuclear weapons ( kaku nuki ) .\nThus the actual agreement , which left the U.S. military presence intact and mentioned nothing about nuclear weapons , sparked outrage and more protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okinawa Henkan Ky\u014dtei ( Okinawa Reversion Agreement ) , it came to be known among Okinawans as Okinawa Henken Ky\u014dtei ( Okinawa Discriminatory Agreement ) .Prime Minister Sat\u014d , who reaped enormous political benefits from the agreement in mainland Japan and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 , was later revealed as the ultimate betrayer .\nAccompanying the Reversion Agreement , Sato and Nixon secretly signed what was officially called an \u201c agreed minute , \u201d drafted by Henry Kissinger , later known in Japan as a \u201c secret nuclear understanding \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicions of its existence , the \u201c secret \u201d was uncovered in 1972 , the year of the reversion , by Mainichi Daily reporter Nishiyama Takichi .\nTwo decades later Wakaizumi Kei , special envoy and interpreter , published a draft of the \u201c agreed minute \u201d in his book Tasaku Nakarishi o Shinzamuto Hossu ( I Want to Believe There Were No Other Options ) , Bungei Shunj\u016b , 1994 .\nThe existence of this document has never been officially recognized by the Japanese or U.S. governments , but in 2009 Sat\u014d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by his late father and President Nixon , inside a drawer at a former family residence in Shibuya Ward , Tokyo..\nThe English text of the agreement reads , Agreed Minute to Joint

Communique .\nHowever , in order to discharge effectively the international obligations assumed by the United States for the defense of countries in the Far East including Japan , in time of great

confidence , \u201d its subsequent revelation showed that Prime Minister Sat\u014d had not only broken his oft-stated promise of a post-reversion Okinawa without nuclear weapons ( kaku-nuki ) , but he had violated his own proclamation for the 1971 Diet resolution of Japan \u2019 s \u201c Three Non-Nuclear Principles \u201d ( non-production , non-possession , and non-introduction ) , which was cited as a major reason for awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 .\nWith Okinawa \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it became the nation \u2019 s only prefecture where the Japanese government explicitly approved the re-deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons on its land , in its surrounding waters or airspace during any U.S.-determined \u201c emergency.\n\u201d The \u201c secret understanding \u201d became headlines and sparked outrage in Japan when it was first revealed publicly by a Mainichi Daily reporter in 1972 and when Sat\u014d \u2019 s interpreter published the text in 1994 .\nSubsequently , Akiba Takeo , a senior Foreign Ministry official , testified before a U.S. Congressional Commission in 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds persuasive to me.\n\u201d Akiba \u2019 s statement to the Commission , obtained by the Union of Concerned Scientists , ignited a predictable firestorm in Japan .\nGregory Kulacki , UCS Senior Analyst , explained , \u201c [ A ] reason for redeploying US nuclear weapons in Okinawa that might sound persuasive to Mr Akiba is that US and Japanese officials can use ambiguities in the language of the Nixon-Sato agreement , and tight controls on the dissemination of information about related bilateral discussions , to obscure the process that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Okinawa nuclear again.\n\u201d Kulacki explains how the \u201c secret understanding \u201d makes redeployment easy in Okinawa .\n[ P ] ermission [ of the Japanese government ] need not be explicit , or public .\nIt may not even be necessary .\nThe language of the Nixon-Sato agreement is intentionally vague and suggests simple notification at a relatively low level of the bureaucracy might be enough .\nThis kind of low level agreement would give the prime minister and other LDP officials the same kind of plausible deniability they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear weapons in Okinawa for more than 50 years .\nThe potential presence of US nuclear weapons in

this as a coup against a democratically elected government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLD were created by and for Western special interests with virtually every aspect of the party funded and supported by US and British government money and with Suu Kyi herself maintaining an entourage of foreign advisors .\nThe purpose of installing a US client regime in power in Myanmar was part of a much wider

in extending its Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipelines , ports , and roads all aready in use or under construction .\nWith the US client regime ousted from power , a secondary objective of burning the nation to the ground , thus blocking China \u2019 s BRI and leaving a failed state on China \u2019 s border to contend with has taken precedence .\nArmed ethnic groups , originally part of the British Empire

Centre , each either directly tied to the US government , or funded by Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants , banks and industrial conglomerates .\nTheir collective narrative is one where China risks investing in a destabilised nation with escalating violence , a narrative well suited for Washington and is encirclement/containment policy toward China .\nLittle treatment or insight is given to who is fuelling this violence .\nWeapons do not spring from the ground nor grow on trees .\nThey are manufactured and shipped to the battlefield .\nWith many militants sporting what are clearly US-manufactured M-16 assault rifles and Eastern Bloc weapons , questions about how they ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets of its towns and cities remain unasked by the Western media .\nThe US has been revealed to have shipped weapons around the globe to support militancy elsewhere ( most notably in Syria ) .\nThere , Eastern Bloc weapons were procured by the US Central Intelligence Agency and then airlifted to militants operating along and within Syria \u2019 s borders .\nThe New York Times in an article titled , \u201c Arms Airlift to Syria Rebels Expands , With Aid From CIA , \u201d noted : From offices at secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arab governments shop for weapons , including a large procurement from Croatia , and have vetted rebel commanders and groups to determine who should

\u201c Free Burma Rangers \u201d led by former US special operations soldier David Eubank .\nUS diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks reveal that David Eubank and his \u201c Free Burma Rangers

ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\u201d But Aso \u2019 s statement was no slip of the tongue .\nA week later , on July 13 , Japan released its annual defense report , which for the first time mentioned the importance of maintaining \u201c stability \u201d around Taiwan because it \u201c is important for Japan \u2019 s security.\n\u201d China \u2019 s response , again , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party mouthpiece Global Times ran an op-ed stating that \u201c Japan will \u2018 lose badly \u2019 if it defends Taiwan secessionists.\n\u201d The piece quoted an anonymous Beijing-based military analyst as saying , \u201c Even the US could not defeat China militarily in the West Pacific region now , so what makes Japan believe it \u2019 s able to challenge China with force ?\n\u201d While the motivations behind Tokyo \u2019 s recent statements are unclear , Japan and Taiwan are openly on the same side in Asia \u2019 s intensifying new Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarily powerful China is the obvious but usually unspoken adversary .\nJapan and Taiwan do not share official diplomatic relations \u2014 Tokyo recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China \u2014 but the two sides are known to share intelligence through back channels .\nIn May last year , as Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen began her second term in office , then-chief Cabinet secretary , now prime minister , Yoshihide Suga said that Japan is eager to develop its ties with Taiwan .\nJapan \u2019 s annual foreign policy report , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its latest edition released on April 27 this year as an \u201c important partner and friend.\n\u201d It also said Japan backs Taiwan \u2019 s campaign to attend the World Health Assembly , the decision-making body of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .\nThe Bluebook stated diplomatically that Taiwan had been successful in fighting the Covid-19 virus and \u201c there should be no blank spaces on the world map.\n\u201d China , which considers Taiwan a renegade province that should be \u201c reunited \u201d with the mainland , strongly opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies .\nThe Bluebook also said that Japan would cooperate with \u201c more countries \u201d to promote freedom of navigation and the rule of law in the Asia-Pacific region .\nIn matters of geostrategic importance , Japan already works closely with the US , India and Australia under the so-called \u201c Quad.\n\u201d Taiwan could be seen as a silent partner , or at least an ally , to the strategic grouping because it is a vital link in the China-focused island chain of defense which stretches from Japan \u2019 s main islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Malaysian part of Borneo .\nHowever , the bigger question remains : what exactly would Japan be prepared to do if China did try to invade Taiwan ?\nWhatever the anonymous military analyst quoted in the Global Times might think , Japan certainly has the means to challenge China militarily .\nOn December 21 , 2020 , the Japanese government approved the ninth consecutive rise in military spending , marking a historic record of 5.34 trillion yen ( US $ 51.7 billion . )\nJapan \u2019 s Self-Defense Forces ( JSDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are comprised of nearly 250,000 active personnel and another 50,000 in reserve , and are equipped with the latest weaponry and technology procured mainly from the US .\nThe Japanese Navy is believed by military analysts to be the strongest in the region after America \u2019 s and thus superior to China \u2019 s still underdeveloped but steadily growing naval forces .\nChina now has two combat-ready aircraft carriers .\nAccording to the Washington-based think tank the Center for Strategic & International Studies , Beijing has made substantial progress in the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is \u201c slated to become the largest surface combatant in the Chinese People \u2019 s Army Navy ( PLAN ) and significantly upgrade China \u2019 s naval capabilities.\n\u201d But the crux of the strategic matter is that Article 9 of Japan \u2019 s supposedly pacifist , post-World War II constitution outlaws war as a means to settle international disputes and its JSDF are therefore legally only allowed to defend the country if it comes under attack .\nBut Aso has argued that Taiwan is situated only 112 kilometers from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore a Chinese invasion could represent an \u201c existential threat \u201d to Japan \u2019 s security .\nIn that direction , the Japanese navy \u2019 s first aircraft carrier since World War II is nearly ready to deploy .\nIt is designed to carry up to 28 light or 14 larger aircraft .\nJeffrey Hornung , a political scientist at the US-based Rand Corporation , wrote in a May 10 paper that Japan would not need to get directly involved in a military conflict over Taiwan .\nBut , he suggests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , self-ruled island , \u201c at a minimum , the United States would require access to its bases in Japan , which would execute combat operations in , over and around Taiwan.\n\u201d The JSDF would in that way \u201c act as a force multiplier for any US-led operation .\nThat means US requests for Japanese involvement would be almost certain.\n\u201d In other words , Japan \u2019 s involvement would be limited to \u201c non-combatant , rear-area support roles \u201d in fields such as \u201c supply , maintenance , transportation , engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOkinawa is proximal to Taiwan and the US base there would be at the front of any military action against China .\nIf China decided to attack Okinawa , or for argument \u2019 s sake any base on Japanese territory , such an attack could be interpreted as an act of aggression and Japan would have the right to act in self-defense .\nBut that scenario also raises another important question : would the US be prepared to intervene and defend Taiwan ?\nThe US and Taiwan , officially the Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington established diplomatic relations with China on January 1 , 1979 .\nOn that day , the US withdrew its recognition of the Republic of China and terminated the 1955 \u201c Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of China.\n\u201d Because either party had to notify the other about the termination a year in advance , the treaty remained in place \u2013 at least nominally \u2013 until January 1 , 1980 .\nThe now null-and-void 1955 treaty , which stipulated that if one country came under attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain aspects replaced by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act .\nUnder the Act , the US was no longer be obliged to defend Taiwan , the US embassy in Taiwan was closed and relations were maintained through a non-profit corporation registered in the District of Columbia known as the American Institute in Taiwan ( AIT ) , which functions as a de facto embassy .\nThe ambiguity of the relationship is evident in a Taiwan Relations Act clause that says that \u201c the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.\n\u201d The Act \u2019 s intention appears to be to dissuade Taiwan from declaring independence from China , while at the same time discouraging China from invading Taiwan .\nBut that all came into force when Jimmy Carter was America \u2019 s president and China was still a fairly poor country , not the regional superpower it has become today .\nAs

\u2019 \u2013 is undoing the gains made backward communities in recent decades , and must be resisted at all costs .\n\u2018 Economic reforms \u2019 \u2013 it \u2019 s a catchphrase that India \u2019 s media pundits have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sleight of hand meant to suggest that these are but the economic equivalent of \u2018 social reforms , \u2019 the celebrated transformative efforts led by the towering figures of modern India , from Jotiba Phule to Sree Narayana Guru .\nIn reality , they stand for a socially and environmentally disastrous policy package ( consisting of Liberalisation , Privatisation and Globalisation ) that was implemented top-down in many countries in the fourth quarter of the 20th century , and in India in early 1990s .\nThis dubious set of policies \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singular purpose : to facilitate the unrestricted entry of big corporations into every sphere of life , with the state acting as private capital \u2019 s protector and agent of dispossession .\nIn fact , India \u2019 s \u2018 economic reforms \u2019 may even have undone some of the hard-won gains achieved by its social reformers , our recent research suggests .\nOur research study , undertaken on behalf of our organisation Swadeshi Andolan , found that not a single SC or ST person is present on the board of directors of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while only six from OBC communities are present .\nOf the total of 270 executives on the boards of directors of these companies , 86 ( 31 % ) are Brahmin , 52 are Bania ( 19 % ) while other savarnas like Khatris and Kayasthas ( 12 % ) , middle castes like Patels and Reddys ( 5 % ) , and a handful of minorities like Jains , Parsis and Muslims make up the rest .\n( Another notable factor is the relatively high number ( 38 ) of foreign citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total ; while women number 37 , some of whom are foreign citizens . )\nAccording to the National Sample Survey Organisation ( NSSO ) 61st Rounds ( 2004\u201305 ) survey , forward castes account for about 31 % of the population based on Schedule 10 of available data .\nHowever , our findings reveal an overwhelming savarna dominance of Indian business , who account for more than 90 % of these roles if you leave the foreign citizens out .\nInterestingly , while business in India is widely perceived to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers show that Brahmins dominate the top decision-making roles in the country \u2019 s leading corporations .\nFurther , the boards of the top 25 corporations are chaired overwhelmingly by savarnas ; Brahmins and Banias occupy nine each of these positions , while Khatris occupy four .\nOf the remaining three positions , two are shared respectively by a Shia Muslim ( Wipro ) , and a foreign citizen ( Nayara Energy ) , while Shiva Nadar of HCL Technologies is the only non-savarna on this list .\nStudy after study has confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and industry , and particularly the world of big corporations .\nThey have also revealed the role of \u2018 economic reforms \u2019 in worsening economic inequality and in creating new forms of disparity .\nOne such study , titled Wealth Ownership and Inequality in India : A Socio-religious Analysis , was jointly conducted by the Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ) , Jawaharlal Nehru University and Indian Institute of Dalit Studies from 2015 to 2017 , and is based on NSSO data from 1.10 lakh households across various states .\nAccording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed \u2018 Hindu High Castes \u2019 or HHCs \u2013 boast four times more wealth than those classified as Scheduled Castes ( SCs ) .\nMoreover , HHCs hold 41 % of the total wealth in the country , which is almost double their population size of 22.28 % .\nThe next biggest slice of the wealth pie is cornered by Hindu Other Backward Classes ( HOBCs ) at close to 31 % , a little less than their population size ( 35.66 % ) .\nMuslims own 8 % of the country \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households stands at nearly 12 % .\nAnd , as expected , SCs and STs own a substantially less share of assets ( 11.3 % combined ) as compared to their population ( over 27 % ) .\nAnother comprehensive research study published in the Economic & Political Weekly in 2012 found that \u201c The average board size of the top 1,000 companies in India was found to be nine members ; nearly 88 % of them were insiders and 12 % were independent directors .\nThe distribution of board members according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward caste members ; 46 % Vaishya and 44 % Brahmin .\nThe OBCs and SCs /STs were a meagre 3.8 % and 3.5 % respectively .\nThese numbers are a stark illustration of the fact that highest echelons of corporate India lack even a semblance of diversity and equality , and is essentially a savarna club ; indeed , a savarna men \u2019 s club at that .\nOur findings show that not only has very little has changed in the caste constitution of India \u2019 s economic hierarchy in the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go up that hierarchy \u2013 the top 25 corporations as opposed to the top 1000 \u2013 the greater the concentration of corporate power in the hands of savarnas .\nGiven the fact that backward communities comprise the overwhelming majority of India \u2019 s population , this extremely skewed representation reveals a systematic bias in the corporate world , where the board of directors are the highest decision makers .\nSince reservation is mandatory only for government jobs , these findings are an indicator of the fate that awaits backward communities if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its policy of privatising every sector .\nThe present government has announced a series of moves for privatisation of Public Sector Undertakings ( PSUs ) .\nGiven the excessively corporate-friendly attitude of this government \u2013 which has become obvious on many fronts \u2013 it \u2019 s safe to say that its privatisation drive is essentially a euphemism for the wholesale transfer of publicly owned assets to private hands for a pittance .\nThe PSUs have historically played a stellar role in nation building , and social and economic development of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are in line for privatisation .\nThese include such high profile firms as Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd ( BPCL ) , Air India , Bharat Earth Movers Limited ( BEML ) , the steel plants of Steel Authority of India Limited ( SAIL ) , National Mineral Development Corporation ( NMDC ) , Indian Medicine & Pharmaceuticals Corporation Ltd. ( IMPCL ) , Shipping Corporation of India ( SCI ) , Container Corporation of India ( CONCOR ) and Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd ( NINL ) , apart from the iconic Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential services like water supply and health services too have been proposed to be privatised .\nThe 2020-21 Union Budget has suggested private participation ( PPP ) even in district hospitals .\nIn a recent report to the UN general assembly , the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights , Philip Alston stated that \u201c Widespread privatisation of public goods is systematically eliminating human rights protections and further marginalising the interests of low income earners and those living in poverty.\n\u201d Experiences of other countries show that left unchecked , privatisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , school education , pension systems , parks and libraries , policing , criminal justice and the military sector , leading to extremely harmful consequences for the public , and especially for those already disadvantaged .\nIn India , privatisation holds serious implications for the future of SCs , STs and Other Backward Communities , who stand to lose most from such policies .\nPrivatisation marginalises low income earners , the majority of whom in India are from backward communities .\nThe reservation policies implemented by PSUs and public services played a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backward communities and facilitated their economical and social development .\nWhen these are privatised , these opportunities are lost permanently , undoing the progress made by these communities in recent decades .\nIt also implies that the educated youth in these communities will permanently lose any opportunity to get high status and high income jobs that have helped their communities advance in recent times .\nAfter Independence , backward communities got reservation in education and in government services , which also helped them start enterprises , especially in agriculture and retail trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many OBCs and SCs started such ventures , and have demonstrated themselves capable of thriving in industry .\nAnd because they would often employ people from their own community in these firms , this helped their communities as a whole to progress .\nNow that the Modi government has allowed FDI in every sector , it is leading to the corporatisation of each of these sectors .\nIn tune with the WTO and Free Trade Agreements , India has reduced import duties across sectors , which has severely impacted small scale industries .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ many small scale industries .\nThese policies opened up these sectors for big corporations , most of who are run by savarnas , and which therefore invariably employ upper caste staff at higher salaries .\nIn fact , these policies have already led to the closure of many small scale industries run by entrepreneurs from backward communities .\nAnother way government helps corporations is through external commercial borrowing ( ECB ) , which is an instrument to facilitate extremely low interest loans for these big companies .\nWhen the corporations fail to repay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector banks \u2013 it is termed \u2018 NPA \u2019 ( Non Performing Assets ) which is often forfeited .\nThe loss is adjusted by compensating the banks by injecting taxpayers \u2019 money into them through a process called \u2018 bank recapitalisation \u2019 .\nA report by leading financial firm Credit Suisse says that in the first five years of Modi government , it adjusted NPAs worth Rs 7,77,800 crore that was owned to public sector banks by corporations .\nBut the same government failed to offer any relief to India \u2019 s struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of backward communities find employment .\nThis , despite these sectors being already in bad shape due to ill-conceived policies such as GST and demonetisation , which hit small scale industries and retail traders the hardest .\nThese were body blows delivered to backward communities , who are already victims of a lack of access to education , credit etc .\nThe three new farm laws are yet another attempt by Modi government to facilitate corporatisation in agriculture and retail trade .\nIf these sectors are corporatized , then most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sectors will perish , severely impacting the members of these communities who derive their income and employment from them .\nAs the data shows , the world of big corporations is almost exclusively controlled by the upper castes .\nThe few backward community members who enter this world must be content with lower grade and blue collar jobs .\nTo make matters worse , increasing levels of automation \u2013 a policy embraced by the present government on behalf of big corporations \u2013 is threatening to wipe out not just jobs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank research paper , \u201c Automation threatens 69 per cent of the jobs in India , and 77 per cent in China \u201d .\nAutomation threatens even those areas where backward communities have recently found employment , such as industrial manufacturing .\nAs for those sectors where automation poses no significant threat , the government \u2019 s new labour code ensures that workers will be reduced to the status of slaves .\nFor backward communities , these trends sound a clear warning .\nIn simple terms , privatisation means more corporatisation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small scale businesses and trades , which in turn means greater job loss .\nAfter three decades of \u2018 economic reforms , \u2019 it \u2019 s clear that who has gained from these policies and who has lost .\nThe governments in power have consistently brought in tax regimes , fiscal measures and policies such as land acquisition laws designed to favour the savarna-dominated corporate world , while the backward communities are crushed under the weight of these policies , or are locked into desperate struggles to protect their land and livelihoods from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time those community organisations , various Left groups and Gandhian organisations like Ekta Parishad who lead these struggles take stock of these policies and their impacts , and join hands to effectively mobilise against them .\nIt may be recalled that Sree Narayana Guru of Kerala , the spiritual teacher who was also one of the most influential social reformers in the state \u2019 s and the nation \u2019 s history , took the initiative to collect funds from the community so that enterprising members of the backward communities could start their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in enabling the social and economic progress made by these communities in the state in the second half of the 20th century .\nIt is time all backward communities come together pool their resources to start their own enterprises while simultaneously resisting these reforms which threaten their very existence .\nThis resistance must be two-fold : on the one hand , they must push back against savarna-dominated corporatisation in favour of small scale industries where backward communities can once again find a footing ; on the other , they must aim for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties which are championing such destructive \u2018 reforms.\n\u2019 Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article

targeted a hotel in Pakistan \u2019 s southwest Baluchistan province hosting China \u2019 s ambassador to Pakistan , Nong Rong .\nAmbassador Nong Rong was not at the hotel at the time of the bombing ,

Initiative ( BRI ) .\nThis attack killed 13 including 9 of the Chinese engineers .\nSuch attacks are not new .\nThey are merely the most recent acts of violence amid a long-standing effort by the US and armed militants it has openly supported for years to thwart China \u2019 s partnership with Pakistan and to sabotage the BRI .\nWhile US President Joe Biden had unveiled his \u201c Build Back Better World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 2021 G7 meeting as America \u2019 s answer to China \u2019 s BRI , it was clearly a smokescreen behind which the US would continue a campaign of global destabilization and militancy aimed at nations cooperating with Beijing and hosting various BRI projects .\nPakistan is among many nations now facing America \u2019 s true answer to the BRI \u2013 state-sponsored terrorism , militancy , and political subversion .\nJoining Pakistan is also Southeast Asian nations like Thailand and Myanmar which have both suffered from US-sponsored anti-government protests in recent years \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform into now ongoing armed conflict .\nThe US has also targeted China internally , focusing its efforts on radicalizing Uyghur separatists in China \u2019 s western Xinjiang region , then undermining Beijing \u2019 s efforts to contain the resulting terrorism .\nXinjiang serves , without coincidence , as a critical juncture for several BRI routes .\nMore than Mere Speculation : America \u2019 s \u201c Free Baluchistan \u201d Campaign Much of Washington \u2019 s efforts to \u201c free Baluchistan \u201d have been copied and pasted from both US efforts to carve up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Kurds defacto autonomous territory , or the US-backed push for a \u201c free East Turkestan \u201d in China \u2019 s Xinjiang region .\nThis latter effort is reflected on the US National Endowment for Democracy \u2019 s ( NED ) own official website which lists its programs for Xinjiang , China as \u201c Xinjiang/East Turkestan ( China ) , \u201d deliberately including the name given to the region by separatists .\nBeyond mere speculation , the US has openly supported armed separatists in Pakistan \u2019 s southwest Baluchistan province for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Congress discussing US support for a \u201c free Baluchistan , \u201d publicly published op-eds written by US-based corporate-funded policy think tanks , and Congressional bills specifically calling for an independent Baluchistan .\nAs early as 2011 , The National Interest would publish a piece by Selig Harrison , director of the Asia Program at the Center for International Policy , titled , \u201c Free Baluchistan.\n\u201d In it , Harrison would argue ( emphasis added ) : While doing less elsewhere in Pakistan , the United States should do more to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast .\nFirst , it should support anti-Islamist Sindhi leaders of the Sufi variant of Islam with their network of 124,000 shrines .\nMost important , it should aid the 6 million Baluch insurgents fighting for independence from Pakistan in the face of growing ISI repression .\nPakistan has given China a base at Gwadar in the heart of Baluch territory .\nSo an independent Baluchistan would serve U.S. strategic interests in addition to the immediate goal of countering Islamist forces .\nIn reality , \u201c supporting anti-Islamist forces \u201d was ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses to maintain involvement not only in Pakistan \u2019 s Baluchistan province , but also across North Africa and the Middle East .\nOften times the US is actually both sponsoring these extremist forces , while also posing as in support of those fighting them .\nThe real reason the US was and is interested in Baluchistan was stated in Harrison \u2019 s very last sentence , alluding to the fact that an independent Baluchistan would complicate or even entirely expel Chinese interests from the region .\nBaluchistan \u2019 s Gwadar Port is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRI .\nIt serves as the terminal destination of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and allows China to ship energy and goods from China to the Arabian Sea , bypassing all of Southeast Asia for shipping to and from the Middle East , Africa , and beyond .\nIn 2012 , the US House of Representatives \u2019 Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Foreign Affairs would focus specifically on supporting an \u201c independent Baluchistan.\n\u201d It would include a prepared statement from retired US Army Lt .\nColonel Ralph Peters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIt never willingly acceded to Pakistan , does not now wish to be part of Pakistan .\nIf a plebiscite or referendum were held tomorrow , it would vote to leave Pakistan , as would every province and territory west of the Indus River .\nHe would then denounce US-Pakistan cooperation and compare Pakistan to \u201c pirates , \u201d claiming : Two hundred years ago , one of our greatest Presidents faced a problem .\nThe Barbary pirates refused to let our ships pass in peace , so we paid tribute money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson put a stop to that .\nToday , we are paying tribute money again , this time to the Pakistani pirates to let our goods pass to Afghanistan .\nMr. Chairman , I am looking for a Thomas Jefferson .\nPeters \u2019 statement would reveal a US desire to carve off most , if not all of Pakistan \u2019 s territory west of the Indus River \u2013 which without coincidence is also where the entirety of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor passes through .\nA successful bid for independence by US-backed separatists would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baluchistan as a US client regime would also mean both US-occupied Afghanistan and this bordering rump state would combine into a single US-controlled region in the heart of Central Asia with access to the sea , vastly enhancing Washington \u2019 s ability to project military power \u2013 both conventional and asymmetric \u2013 throughout the region .\nAlso in 2012 , a US House of Representatives resolution titled unambiguously , \u201c Expressing the sense of Congress that the people of Baluchistan , currently divided between Pakistan , Iran , and Afghanistan , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sovereign country , \u201d would be introduced .\nEven though it did not pass , it indicates the very open and ongoing support within certain circles of US power to promote an \u201c independent Baluchistan.\n\u201d As the US has done with other ongoing separatist projects around the globe , it and its European allies cultivate a government in exile for the imagined nation of Baluchistan .\nThe favored leader of this imagined nation is the \u201c Khan of Kalat , \u201d Mir Suleman Dawood .\nIn one event hosted by \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords in 2017 , Mir Suleman Dawood would claim China \u2019 s investments and development of Baluchistan would only heighten tensions .\nOne of the main complaints made by separatists in Baluchistan is perceived neglect by Islamabad .\nHowever , it is very clear that infrastructure development driven by CPEC would alleviate this , meaning opposition to CPEC is in actuality prolonging this neglect \u2013 even actively preventing it from being addressed .\nDuring this talk in 2017 in London , it was even made clear that if CPEC projects continued toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent Baluchistan \u201d would only become more remote .\nWhile it was never stated directly why during the discussion , it is clear that a developed and more prosperous Baluchistan would undermine and overcome separatist extremism in precisely the same way development in China \u2019 s Tibet and Xinjiang regions did .\nRealistic or Not , US Will Continue Supporting Militancy While these circles of US and European power promote independence for Pakistan \u2019 s Baluchistan province , they also admit the separatist groups themselves are unlikely to achieve independence and would \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fractured failed state .\nRalph Peters himself was included in a 2012 Huffington Post article titled , \u201c Serious Internal Issues Undermining Baloch Insurgency And Independence Movement , \u201d where he depicted the independence movement in less than optimistic terms .\nAccording to Peters , one of the most serious issues with the Baloch independence movement is \u201c deeply troubling \u201d infighting .\nIn fact , he is emphatic in his condemnation of such bickering ; going so far as to assert : \u201c they are quickly becoming their own worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baloch simply don \u2019 t understand that their personal feuding undermines the larger movement : \u201c Certain Baloch fail to understand that their only hope in gaining independence is if they put their own egos and vanity aside and work together .\nThis is the cold hard fact .\nThey are already outgunned and outmanned .\nPakistan will continue to to exploit their differences until they realize this.\n\u201d So long as the Baloch continue to engage in \u201c petty infighting , \u201d including \u201c savaging each other in emails , \u201d Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West .\nIn fact , he warns that such infighting could eventually put off even their staunchest supporters .\nUltimately , however , whether or not the US can achieve their primary objective of carving off Pakistani territory and outright stopping CPEC , the US will continue supporting militancy in Baluchistan and elsewhere west of the Indus River .\nJust as we \u2019 ve seen this year with attacks targeting Chinese engineers working on CPEC or an assassination attempt on the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan himself \u2013 the militancy will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing CPEC and utilizing it to its maximum potential .\nPresident Biden \u2019 s B3W proposal was , at face value , an empty proposition lacking even the most basic details \u2013 because just like a screen of smoke \u2013 it is not meant to do anything except obfuscate .\nIn this case , B3W is obfuscating a campaign of state-sponsored terrorism used by the West as its actual answer to China \u2019 s BRI \u2013 using armed militants to block or destroy BRI projects rather than present to the world a compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Does the Future Hold for CPEC ?\nChina has demonstrated a significantly compelling solution to US-sponsored separatism in both Tibet and Xinjiang where Chinese security measures coupled with infrastructure projects , job programs , and other means of addressing the root causes of extremism effectively smothered the long-burning fires lit by Washington .\nA similar plan for addressing security , poverty , and perceived neglect in Baluchistan would stand the best chance of succeeding there as well .\nWe can anticipate any security operation or economic program implemented by Pakistan with China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West \u2019 s industrialized \u201c human rights \u201d complex and Western media campaigns to depict it in the same nefarious manner China \u2019 s efforts in Tibet and Xinjiang have been depicted \u2013 as \u201c genocide.\n\u201d The foundations have already been laid , with US NED programs focused specifically on Baluchistan province for years to build up fronts posing as human rights monitoring groups apt at fabricating reports regarding Islamabad \u2019 s \u201c abuses \u201d in the region .\nThis localized propaganda campaign could \u2013 just as it was in Xinjiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are deemed right .\nIt will be a race between Beijing and Islamabad \u2019 s ability to develop Baluchistan faster than the US and its allies can undermine and destabilize it , but it is a race that has already clearly begun , and a race that is both dangerous and deadly .\nThe US \u201c withdrawal \u201d from Afghanistan means that covert operations can be run out of Afghanistan \u2019 s territory by US contractors or special operations forces with a better sense of plausible deniability .\nThe UK has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for \u201c higher risk \u201d tasks against \u201c big state adversaries \u201d \u2013 clearly meaning China ( as well as Russia ) .\nWhether or not US and British operators will be plucked by local security forces from covert activities in western Pakistan remains to be seen , but the long-standing support by the West of armed extremists in this region is well established \u2013 support that still benefits and fulfills Western foreign policy objectives \u2013 so support that will undoubtedly continue well into the foreseeable future .\nNote to

domestic product .\nThe costs total at least A $ 390 billion in the past 60 years .\nOur analysis found feral cats have been the most economically costly species since 1960 .\nTheir A $ 18.7 billion bill is mainly associated with attempts to control their abundance and access , such as fencing , trapping , baiting and shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extinctions in Australia , and so perhaps investment to limit their damage is worth the price tag .\nAs a group , the management and control of invasive plants proved the worst of all , collectively costing about A $ 200 billion .\nOf these , annual ryegrass , parthenium and ragwort were the costliest culprits because of the great effort needed to eradicate them from croplands .\nInvasive mammals were the next biggest burdens , costing Australia

.\nIn the Northern Territory , the dothideomycete fungus that causes banana freckle disease brings the greatest economic burden , whereas cats and foxes are the costliest species in the ACT and NSW

and ambitions have alarmed all the states which border with this giant .\nHowever , among these countries , there are those with which the PRC has a particularly complicated relationship .\nFor example , Japan is one of them .\nOn the one hand , China and Japan , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not help but cooperate .\nOn the other hand , there is competition between the countries , territorial issues , and a heavy memory of the events of World War II , dubbed the Nanjing Massacre when the Japanese military seized part of the Chinese territory and showed incredible cruelty to the civilian population there .\nNevertheless , cooperation between the countries is ongoing and very active .\nFor example , in 2019 , before the economic crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the world , Sino-Japanese trade was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the PRC is currently Japan \u2019 s second trading partner after its main ally , the United States .\nToday \u2019 s primary role in all of Beijing \u2019 s economic policy is played by One Belt , One Road Initiative ( OBOR ) , which aims to connect China with as many countries as possible through a single transport infrastructure .\nThis will allow Beijing to maximize its commodity flows worldwide and bring its global economic influence to unprecedented heights .\nThat is why the PRC is now particularly eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector .\nAround the world , the Celestial Empire supports the construction of roads , ports , and the development of international routes to incorporate them into the OBOR system .\nChina also has joint transportation projects with Japan .\nFor example , a new water route between the two states began operating in 2019 .\nAfter reaching the east coast of China , cargo ships from Japan sail up China \u2019 s largest river , the Yangtze , until they reach the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province , PRC , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important transport hubs in Central China .\nIn the first five months of 2021 alone , 36 flights were made , and 2,799 containers were delivered from Japan to Wuhan .\nAt the end of June 2021 , another cargo ship sailed from the Port of Nagoya in Japan to Wuhan .\nHe brought a shipment of cars in his containers for onward shipment to Mongolia .\nAt the same time , another ship was dispatched from Japan with the same cargo , also for shipment to Mongolia , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese media reported on the launch of a new cargo route to connect Japan and Mongolia via PRC territory .\nThe route with a total length of more than 5,000 km includes the above-described water route from Japan along the Yangtze to Wuhan .\nWuhan will begin the overland railroad section of the route , ending in the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar .\nThe cars from both ships are expected to arrive at their destination in the second half of July 2021 .\nAt this point , the Japan-Wuhan-Mongolia route can be considered fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery time from Japan to Mongolia will now be only 20 days .\nFrom a purely economic point of view , the new route seems convenient and profitable for all three countries united by it .\nHowever , it should be remembered that the underlying differences between Japan and China and general tensions throughout the region have not gone away .\nAs mentioned above , there is a territorial dispute between the Land of the Rising Sun and the PRC .\nThe subject of the dispute is the Senkaku Islands in the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these eight small islands are worth fighting for because they are considered to have oil and gas reserves in their area .\nWhile politicians in Beijing think about territory and resources , the memory of the Nanjing Massacre and its tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of innocent victims ( the exact number of victims is still unknown ) is still alive among ordinary Chinese .\nAlthough no serious conflict between China and Japan has yet been portended , if it does occur , the Chinese people and the Chinese army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in size and equipment , may perceive such development with great enthusiasm .\nIn turn , Japan is trying to remove references to Nanjing from its history textbooks .\nJapanese ruling circles are increasingly raising the question of repealing Article Nine of the Japanese Constitution , which prohibits the country from having a full-fledged army and navy , limiting its military potential to self-defense forces .\nIn addition , Japan continues to cling to its military alliance with the United States and has not removed American military bases from its territory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe USA , which is also one of China \u2019 s main competitors , is also doing everything to secure Japan \u2019 s place in the anti-China axis that Washington is trying to build with India and Australia .\nThus , despite the enormous mutual benefits that Japan and the PRC derive from their economic cooperation , the long-term prospects of their relationship remain unclear .\nIn addition , it should be noted that China \u2019 s relations with Mongolia are also ambiguous .\nOn the one hand , Mongolia is greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even many essential positions in the country are held by ethnic Chinese .\nOn the other hand , there are also forces in Mongolia that want more independence from the PRC .\nIt should be recalled that Mongolia was dependent on the Chinese Empire until the beginning of the twentieth century .\nThe Mongolian Revolution occurred in 1911 , due to which Mongolia tried to become an independent state .\nThis was only partially successful : most of the population in the southern part of the country were ethnic Chinese who wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , Mongolia split into two parts : southern Inner Mongolia and northern Outer Mongolia .\nOuter Mongolia became the independent state of Mongolia , while Inner Mongolia remained part of the Chinese Empire , later becoming part of the PRC .\nIn 1949 , the PRC and Mongolia officially recognized each other .\nHowever , there were people on both sides of the border who were dissatisfied with the situation .\nSome Chinese believe that Mongolia should be part of the PRC , and some Mongolians feel that Chinese Inner Mongolia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ground for a Sino-Mongolian conflict exists .\nWhether it is destined to develop depends on the socio-economic situation in the two countries , politicians \u2019 interests , and the international climate .\nOf course , all well-meaning forces in the region are in favor of maintaining good-neighborly relations .\nHowever , conducting mutually beneficial cooperation , states should keep in mind the differences mentioned above and be prepared for various surprises .\nThe Japan-China-Mongolia route is convenient and vital for these countries , but it will instantly stop working in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlocked and sandwiched between two neighbors : China and Russia , could be particularly affected .\nIn principle , Japan is also a somewhat isolated country , from which it is relatively easy to reach China , Korea , and Russia by water or air .\nAt the same time , the other parts of the world are not short trips across the ocean .\nBoth Japan and Mongolia need overland connections to Eurasia , and if they lose the ability to do so through China , then the most logical option is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for several years has been gradually mastering the Russian Trans-Siberian railroad , which connects the Russian Far East to the western part of the country , where it connects to the railroads going to Europe .\nIn May 2019 , a ceremony was held in the Japanese port city of Yokohama to mark the start of shipments to Europe via Russia : having crossed the sea leg between Japan and Russia , goods from the Land of the Rising Sun are heading west along the Trans-Siberian Railway .\nAs for Russian-Mongolian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far rarely appeared in the media .\nHowever , due to Mongolia \u2019 s geographic location and the growing power of the PRC , the conclusion can be drawn that strengthening cooperation with Russia is the only way for the country to balance China \u2019 s influence .\nThus , even though China \u2019 s global adversary is the United States and its regional rivals are Japan , India , and others , Russia , which has good relations with China , should play the role of mediator and

been an eye-opener in many ways .\nIt highlighted how much India has changed through the searing pain and suffering it underwent in the past one-year period and how that tumultuous period also led to a reset in the government \u2019 s calculus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became inevitable .\nThe \u2018 body language \u2019 of the joint press conference by Blinken and his Indian host External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Wednesday testifies to it .\nThe US-Indian relationship remains fundamentally strong insofar it enjoys bipartisan support in both countries that it is a consequential relationship .\nBut beneath that threshold , fault lines have appeared .\nFirst and foremost , the Biden administration \u2019 s neoconservative ideology obliges it to adopt intrusive policies on issues of democracy , human rights and rule of law , which grates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradoxically , some of the most pro-American sections of Indian opinion also happen to be the harshest critics of the Modi government today .\nTheir alienation is so deep that they won \u2019 t even mind joining hands with the Indian left in berating the Modi government .\nBlinken \u2019 s move to hold a \u2018 civil society roundtable \u2019 discussion with a group of Indians conveyed a powerful message to the Modi Government that things may not be as bad as in Belarus or Myanmar , but India is being perceived by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way as Recep Erdogan \u2019 s Turkey \u2014 an ally who is straying toward post-modern authoritarianism .\nAn AFP dispatch from Delhi reported that at the discussion , Blinken \u201c issued a veiled warning\u2026 about Indian democracy backsliding.\n\u201d read more No amount of wordplay by Blinken could cover up the reality that he had no word of praise for the Modi Government .\nNor did Jaishankar appear particularly perturbed by that .\nEstimating correctly that the Biden Administration is unlikely to easily abandon the goals it has been pursuing , Jaishankar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either .\nAnd at one point , he interjected at the press conference to defiantly point out that \u201c the quest for a more perfect union applies as much to the Indian democracy as it does to the American one.\n\u201d Jaishankar asserted that \u201c it is the moral obligation of all polities to right wrongs when they have been done , including historically .\nAnd many of the decisions and policies you \u2019 ve seen in the last few years fall in that category.\n\u201d He held the ground that \u201c freedoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never equate freedom with non-governance or lack of governance or poor governance .\nThey are two completely different things.\n\u201d It is difficult to recall an Indian minister in modern times pushing back at the US publicly .\nread more The press conference also highlighted the deep disillusionment in Delhi over the irresponsible manner in which the US cut loose and exited Afghanistan , leaving that country in shambles and jeopardising regional security \u2014 and stability and billions of dollars worth Indian investment in that country , both in financial support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaishankar noted bitterly that outcomes are being decided in the battlefield in Afghanistan and alluded to continuing Pakistani interference .\nHe didn \u2019 t take Blinken \u2019 s easy route to put the blame on the Taliban and instead underscored the \u201c broad consensus , deep consensus \u201d among most of the neighbours of Afghanistan that there should be a political settlement .\nCertainly , Washington \u2019 s clumsy rearguard action to create another QUAD ( Quadrilateral Diplomatic Platform ) comprising the US , Uzbekistan , Afghanistan and Pakistan with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humiliating defeat in the 20-year war would have come as a nasty surprise to Delhi and prompted it to slam the door shut on any form of bandwagoning with America in the Hindu Kush .\nThe dryness in Jaishankar \u2019 s tone had a tinge of contempt .\nAs regards the all-important Covid-19 vaccines , Blinken didn \u2019 t say a word about TRIPS waiver , which was an Indian initiative .\nQuite obviously , Biden who initially supported the initiative since quietly backtracked under pressure from the powerful Pharma companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their argument that the real solution lies in quickly relieving the global COVID-19 vaccine imbalance by pushing a package of interventions , including limiting export restrictions , improving vaccine manufacturing in the global south , and issuing voluntary licenses that would allow specific manufacturers to avoid intellectual property restrictions , but without instituting a universal waiver .\nSo , at the end of the day , Blinken made a grand announcement that US will supply 25 million doses of vaccine to India !\nFrom past experience , India is unsure whether even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise .\nJaishankar didn \u2019 t react .\nBlinken also avoided making any assurances to give India full access to the raw materials for vaccine production .\nDid Blinken make any trade concessions to ease India \u2019 s post-pandemic economy recovery ?\nWill the US help us to avoid another apocalyptic scenario when the 3rd Wave arrives ?\nDid he promise to invest in India to create jobs ?\nDid he have any advice how Indian Army can resume patrolling on Depsang Plains ?\nNo , none of that .\nBlinken \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India from drifting away from the US-led anti-China coalition .\nThe Biden Administration is worried that without India , the QUAD would unravel and the containment strategy against China wouldn \u2019 t gain traction in Asia .\nThus , in the typical American way to hustle difficult partners , Blinken began with a bang by meeting Tibetan representatives \u2014 the first of its kind in India or in a third country by US officials \u2014 which was a calculated move to create misleading optics that would queer the pitch of India-China tensions .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitable friend \u2014 undercutting his standing while enjoying his hospitality at his home .\nIt only shows how testy the Blinken administration is nowadays when it comes to China .\nBut Blinken underestimated the fault lines in the US-Indian relationship and the widening chasm between the two countries over the range of issues concerning Afghanistan , vaccine distribution and human rights issues .\nThis was a rare India-US high-level exchange where there was hardly any rhetoric directed against China .\nHaving said that , the strong likelihood is that India may take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which President Biden plans to convene .\nThat will be a defining moment , as the US intention is to create a regional mechanism to strategically contain and exert pressure on China \u2014 simply put , to institutionalise the QUAD , where all four countries have their own reasons to address the perceived pressures and challenges posed by China \u2019 s rise .\nThe Quad \u2019 s record so far is dismal \u2014 be it on Covid vaccines , supply chains on rare earths or as counter to China \u2019 s Belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in US-China relations is expected to be rocky and the Biden Administration hopes to suppress China .\nIndeed , the strategic contradictions are self-evident insofar as all the QUAD countries , including the US , also have need for bilateral economic cooperation and even regional cooperation with China .\nWhen the top dog in the QUAD slyly keeps the door open for cooperation , the choice for the three subalterns couldn \u2019 t be clearer .\nIndia needs to continue to walk the fine line both to avoid collateral damage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China as well as to keep its own autonomy to negotiate with China bilaterally .\nBiden is a highly experienced politician and if he gets to realise the futility of trying to suppress China , a pattern of co-existence may well emerge .\nNote to readers : Please click the share

the most important conditions for consolidating the military \u2019 s power and influence in civil society .\nTherefore , Duterte \u2019 s decision is a compromise with the military \u2019 s elite ahead of the 2022 presidential election .\nAccording to the Philippine constitution , a person who is elected president can not be re-elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe current president can not be re-elected in 2022 , but most local observers point out that his daughter , Sara Duterte , is a leading candidate to succeed him .\nInterestingly however , the day Duterte held talks with the U.S.

congestion on major highways in Greater Manila and should contribute to the economic development of the metropolitan area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge opening ceremony coincided with the meeting between the Philippine President and Austin .\nManila could be showing that despite continuing with VFA , it wants to maintain a balance with Washington and Beijing .\nThe U.S. traditionally forces its partners in the region to make a choice \u2013 the U.S. or China .\nThis vector was particularly pursued under the previous Trump administration .\nPresident Joe Biden still implements this policy ,

animosities are in fact pushing some countries , such as Vietnam , to lean more towards the U.S. rather than China .\nHowever , even Vietnam can not completely divorce from China as it is an

that ravaged the workforce ( cholera , malaria , dysentery , beriberi , ulcers ) .\nIn February 1943 the projected construction time was cut from twelve months to eight and a \u2018 speedo \u2019 campaign was launched that forced prisoners to work longer days with less rest .\nAs the pace was stepped up , more than 12,000 Allied prisoners died , including 2646 of about 13,000 Australians , and a much greater but unknown number of romusha .\nThey died of starvation , exhaustion , illness ( cholera in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have been one death for every sleeper laid for the line .\nAt Hintok construction camp ( adjacent to the infamous Hellfire Pass and about 150 kilometres from Banpong ) , where Yi was one of six Korean civilian camp guards , about 100 of 800 prisoners died .\nOn the camp \u2019 s worst days in mid-1943 , that meant up to six each day .\nNo sooner was the line opened , in October 1943 , than it was smashed by Allied bombing .\nFew trains ever ran on @ @

returned home , war-crime trials , with their stories of forced heavy labour , beatings , general ill-treatment , hunger and disease , fed bitter , lasting negative images of Japan .\nIn 1991 , my Australian National University ( ANU ) colleague Hank Nelson , a specialist on the war experience in Australia , and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utsumi Aiko , a Japanese academic specialist on the war and Japan \u2019 s relations with its Asian neighbours , convened a conference in Canberra that sought to bring together as many survivors as possible , i.e .\nincluding formerly hostile parties , to reflect on the episode across the gulf of half a century .\nNotable former Australian POWs included Edward ( \u2018 Weary \u2019 ) Dunlop ( 1907\u201393 ) , Tom Uren ( 1921\u20132015 ) and Hugh Clarke ( 1919\u201396 ) .\nDunlop was already a distinguished surgeon and widely revered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former deputy prime minister , and Clarke a highly regarded novelist .\nFrom the \u2018 other \u2019 side just the Korean , \u2018 civilian auxiliary \u2019 or gunzoku , Yi Hak-nae , confronted and sought forgiveness from and reconciliation with his former charges .\nThe book of this conference was published in English in 1993 and in Japanese in 1994 .\nIn 1946\u201347 , Australia conducted twenty-three war-crimes trials in Singapore , with sixty-two defendants .\nIt found eighteen guilty and sentenced them to death , acquitted eleven , and sentenced an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yi was tried on 18 and 20 March 1947 .\nThe charges were that during part of the period March to August 1943 Yi had \u2018 occupied the position of Camp Commandant \u2019 and during that period : The prisoners of war lived under the most appalling conditions , shelter and accommodation were totally inadequate and most primitive .\nThey were also denied sufficient food , medical supplies , clothing and footwear\u2026 [ while being ] forced to perform heavy manual labour on the railway line for which they were totally unfit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result of this treatment sickness and disease among the prisoners of war became rife and by the end of April 43.2 % of the camp strength were in hospital\u2026out of 800 Australian prisoners of war who went into the camp over 100 of them died there , and that the accused was responsible for their death.8 Found guilty of having \u2018 inhumanely [ sic ] treated prisoners of war \u2019 \u2014in effect , guilty of mass murder\u2014Yi was sentenced to death .\nHis defence counsel petitioned the court and in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nYi \u2019 s trial was marked by multiple irregularities , but the overwhelming one was the assumption that he had been \u2018 Camp Commandant \u2019 , himself responsible for the \u2018 appalling conditions \u2019 .\nIt was a major mistake that should have been corrected at the outset .\nBecause guards such as Yi were the principal point of contact between prisoners and camp authorities they tended to be seen as responsible , but they had zero control over the conditions of the camp , their status was lower than a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses and discrimination from the Japanese military .\nTasked with forcing POWs to work on the line construction , and under tremendous pressure from the Japanese army camp command to meet daily prisoner work norms , Yi had to maximize the labour force , while Dunlop , then a 36-year-old Australian army surgeon and the senior prisoner commander , had to minimize it , doing what he could to prevent prisoners who were ill or enfeebled from starvation or disease from being allocated to work detachments .\nFor some weeks in March-April 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular Japanese authorities , Yi did indeed serve as acting camp commandant , but he was obliged to implement policy , not determine it .\nThough Yi was charged over matters to do with his having \u2018 occupied the position of Camp Superintendent \u2019 , a status that continued until August , in his account ( discussed below ) Colonel Dunlop made no such claim .\nHe referred only to the very different charge , that in April-May 1943 \u2018 while in charge of works parade arrangements ( italics added ) [ Yi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hospital to work \u2019 .\nHe was clear and specific as to time , and made no reference to any beatings or brutality , or to any act of Yi \u2019 s causing death .\nHe added the names of two other prisoners from whom details could be sought.9 Since no statement from either appears in the file it would seem either that they were not asked or that they declined to answer .\nYi \u2019 s account to the court confirmed Dunlop \u2019 s statement .\nHis spell as acting commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March-April 1943 ) .\n\u2018 After May \u2019 , he told the court ( which did not dispute the fact ) , \u2018 I was ordered to assist in the orderly room so I did not have any connection whatever with the work parade \u2019 .\nDunlop \u2019 s own diary , not published until much later but meticulous in its detail , makes clear his hatred for Yi as \u2018 a proper little bastard \u2019 ( 17 March 1943 ) , \u2018 a terrible thorn in the side \u2019 ( 6 April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical judgment , forced more sick men out to work \u2019 ( 12 April 1943 ) , but he made no reference to ever having been beaten or personally ill-treated by him.10 He also confirms that Yi \u2019 s spell as acting camp commandant ended in April .\nThe indictment was therefore fundamentally flawed by falsely charging Yi with overall responsibility for camp conditions continuing to August .\nMuch later , to the Canberra conference of 1991 and as if to settle the matter , Dunlop said : I was bashed by others\u2026but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basher .\nI didn \u2019 t regard him as a major criminal .\nI regarded him as a pawn .\nHis powers were very limited .\nMost of my real fights were with the Japanese engineers.11 Not only that but , far from being camp commandant at the time he was accused of committing the offences , Yi was an 18-year-old boy ( born 1925 ) , a fact that Colonel Dunlop and other former prisoners in the camp were shocked to learn when they re-met him in Canberra in 1991 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested and put on trial in 1947 it was on the same charges\u2014ill-treatment of prisoners\u2014over which he had been arrested and imprisoned , but then released , the previous year .\nOn 17 October 1946 , Lieutenant-Colonel Robert C. Smith , commander of 1st War Crimes section , Singapore , had minuted the Yi file : \u2018 Case not serious enough to warrant trial .\nClose file \u2019 .\nHe then wrote to headquarters , Singapore district , to say : \u2018 It is now advised that the case against the above-named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a minor nature \u2019 .\nThat should have been the end of the matter .\nCharges against him dismissed , Yi was duly released on 10 December 1946 .\nBoarding a repatriation vessel , he got only as far as Hong Kong before being removed from the ship , re-arrested , and subjected to the same charges as those Lieutenant-Colonel Smith a year earlier had thought \u2018 minor \u2019 .\nThe major difference in charges was the addition of the following words : \u2018 \u2026out of 800 Australian prisoners of war who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them died there , and that the accused was responsible for their death \u2019 .\nIn short , with Yi being found guilty in 1947 of the charge of mass murder that had been dismissed in 1946 , the trial offended against the fundamental legal principle of autrefois acquit .\nAstonishingly , the court in 1947 was unaware of those 1946 proceedings until they were brought to its attention by Yi \u2019 s counsel after the 1947 judgment and sentence .\nThe proceedings were brief , even summary in character , no small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital charge .\nThere were no witnesses to be called or cross-examined , and just eight pieces of written testimony\u2014seven sworn affidavits and one unsworn \u2018 Q \u2019 form , discussed below .\nYi estimates ( and the transcript suggests that the figure is about right ) that he confronted the tribunal for about forty minutes .\nYi understood little of the proceedings save the three heavy words with which they concluded : \u2018 death by hanging \u2019 .\nThe evidence was thin .\nOf the 600 or so former prisoners from Hintok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two captains , one lieutenant , one sergeant-major and one private ) submitted sworn affidavits .\nThree in particular made serious allegations against Yi .\nCaptain Cecil George Brettingham-Moore referred to \u2018 one classic occasion \u2019 sometime between 25 May and 14 July , when conditions at Hintok were at their worst , on which Yi had beaten Dunlop with a bamboo stick after the latter had interceded to try to prevent sick men from being assigned to work brigades .\nSergeant-Major Austen Adam Fyfe testified that Yi had often beaten him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around July 1943 on which he had seen Yi bashing Colonel Dunlop severely across the head and body .\nMajor Hector George Greiner referred in particular to an incident some days after Dunlop \u2019 s arrival in the camp ( i.e .\nApril 1943 ) in which Yi had attacked and beaten him .\nHe also referred to Yi as having been \u2018 in charge \u2019 , and described him as \u2018 one of the most brutal guards I had experiences with \u2019 , the very phrase that in 2020 Reuters stretched into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records reviewed by Reuters show prisoners [ sic ] remembered Lee ( Yi/Hiromura ) , known as the Lizard , as one of the most brutal guards on the railway \u2019 .\nAlthough the Greiner charge was plausible , the problem with the Fyfe and Brettingham-Moore testimony is that it refers to a July bashing ( Fyfe ) , and a \u2018 classic occasion \u2019 between late May and July that Brettingham-Moore remembered , neither of which could have occurred on Yi \u2019 s watch .\nThree other former prisoners made some mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Crespigny said that Colonel Dunlop suffered abuse , slapping and humiliation at Yi \u2019 s hands practically daily but had no recollection of any \u2018 severe \u2019 beating .\nCaptain Richard Hastings Allen described Yi as \u2018 no worse than most of the camp staff where beating of PW was a daily occurrence \u2019 .\nLieutenant Reginald Gilbert Houston referred to Dunlop having been frequently \u2018 ill-treated \u2019 by Hiromura/Yi , but he mentioned no specific incident .\nOne further ex-prisoner was Private Harry Ashley Hugal .\nThough present at the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only ordinary soldier to lay any complaint over his treatment there , Hugal made no mention of Yi at all in his affidavit .\nThe evidence was thus far from decisive , and Dunlop \u2019 s testimony , as senior officer in the camp and himself the subject of alleged beatings at Yi \u2019 s hands , was plainly crucial to the prosecution case .\nYet there was no sworn statement from him but simply a pencilled \u2018 Q \u2019 form ( \u2018 a piece of unsworn paper \u2019 , as defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his declining ( or refusing ) to submit any sworn accusation or to give direct evidence amounted , in this capital trial , to pointed silence .\nThe only explanation for why the trial \u2019 s \u2018 Exhibit One \u2019 was being presented in such an unsworn format would seem to be that the war was over and Dunlop had no interest in retribution.12 The court likewise gave no explanation as to why the \u2018 Q \u2019 forms of other prisoners were not before it.13 In an affidavit dated 27 June 1946 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Eiji ] , a young engineer attached to the railway corps who had been responsible for work parties , \u2018 enjoyed a reputation for ruthlessness \u2019 , and was \u2018 directly responsible for many deaths \u2019 .14 Brettingham-Moore and Hugal also mention Hirota in their depositions , and at one point in Brettingham-Moore \u2019 s deposition the letters \u2018 ta \u2019 ( of Hirota ) have been crossed out and replaced by \u2018 mura \u2019 ( of Hiromura ) , so the possibility of mistaken identity in the judicial process , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real .\nHirota , tried in September 1946 on charges of ill-treatment of prisoners , was found guilty , and executed on 21 January 1947.15 After the 1947 tribunal returned its guilty verdict ( \u2018 inhumane treatment of prisoners , causing death of more than one hundred \u2019 ) and sentence against Yi , however , both in Singapore and in Canberra doubt seems to have persisted .\nThe case lacked a decisive piece of evidence .\nExhibit One , Dunlop \u2019 s Q form , was a remarkably thin basis upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribunal referred the file to the judge advocate-general in Canberra , L. B. Simpson , for advice , Simpson on 2 June wrote an initial opinion in which he saw \u2018 no reason in the proceedings why the finding and sentence should not be legally confirmed \u2019 but then went on to add , almost as an afterthought , the following , contradictory , comment : \u2018 In comparison with the other cases , this is not a particularly bad one , and I strongly urge the confirming authority to mitigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 .\nHad Dunlop in 1947 added his voice to make serious accusations against Yi , either by a sworn deposition or by an appearance in person before the tribunal in Singapore , the death sentence would almost certainly have been confirmed and carried out .\nOn the other hand , had he appeared in person and made clear\u2014in either format\u2014that Yi had been an underling rather than camp commandant and that several of the affidavits were problematic , it is conceivable that Yi might have been found not guilty , or guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunlop \u2019 s non-cooperation meant a reprieve for Yi .\nOn 7 November 1947 , after almost eight months on death row , he was advised that his sentence had been commuted to twenty years .\nIn due course he served ten before release .\nThe Japan into which Yi and other Koreans emerged after his release in 1956 was a country that they had never known , where they had no family or friends .\nSince in Korea they were thought of as Japanese \u2018 collaborating \u2019 war criminals , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean War while they were in prison , they could not go home .\nBy a bizarre irony , very soon after Yi emerged from Tokyo \u2019 s Sugamo prison Japan came to be headed by a former A-class ( major war crimes ) prisoner , Kishi Nobusuke ( 1896\u20131987 ) .\nWhere B- and C-class Koreans at the lowest level of the Japanese military system , regularly bashed and beaten themselves , with zero power or authority to delay or block orders , were required to serve out their sentences until 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan \u2019 s militarist elite as architect of colonial policy and signatory to the declaration of war on the West in 1941 , together with other A-class prisoners , was released in December 1948 .\nEscaping the gallows and being suddenly freed on the very day that seven others of the A group were executed , Kishi went on to become prime minister in 1957 , an invaluable US asset as occupation policy shifted from punishment to recovery and incorporation of Japan into the Cold War system .\nOnce freed , Yi organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B- and C-class senpan into a mutual welfare society , setting up and running a taxi company in Tokyo .\nYi became leader of the movement to secure compensation for the Koreans equivalent to that enjoyed by regular Japanese ex-soldier senpan ( beginning in 1954 and in today \u2019 s terms around $ 41,000 a year ) , but since Japan \u2019 s claims to Korea and Taiwan had been extinguished with the San Francisco Treaty of 1951 , Koreans and Taiwanese , suddenly \u2018 non-Japanese \u2019 , were excluded from compensation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Koreans who were first mobilised and then punished as \u2018 Japanese \u2019 but then involuntarily stripped of their \u2018 Japaneseness \u2019 upon dissolution of the Japanese empire .\nHe has been seeking recognition for more than sixty years since then .\nIn 1991 , in an unforgettable scene , meeting for the first time in over fifty years on the campus of the Australian National University , Yi proffered , and Dunlop graciously accepted , an apology : From the bottom of my heart I wanted to apologise profoundly , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunlop and all the former POWs , for the bitterness and pain of the loss of so many of their comrades under such harsh circumstances .\nBefore you all , I apologise from my heart.16 Two things in retrospect are notable about the Yi apology .\nFirst , he was clear and unambiguous about his share of responsibility for the pain and suffering caused to Allied prisoners .\nSecond , he sought their understanding for the plight of the Korean senpan , powerless to influence the oppressive , violent nature of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australians , were victims .\nHe asked them to understand that he , too , as a POW of the Allied forces , especially in Singapore , had been treated cruelly .\nFormer POWs listening to Yi \u2019 s talk to the 1991 conference were left surprised and uncomfortable by his insistence on the second of these points .\nYi was so overwhelmed by the 1991 meeting that he made one further trip to Australia a year later , visiting Dunlop at his Melbourne home to present him with a gold watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More War \u2019 .17 Dunlop died shortly afterwards .\nIn November 1991 , months after the Canberra conference , a group of seven compatriot senpan , including Yi , launched a suit in the Tokyo district court seeking compensation from the government of Japan equivalent to the emoluments they would have been entitled to had they been Japanese .\nTheir suit was rejected in successive actions , but the Tokyo High Court in July 1998 added to its judgment a rider to the effect that it was up to \u2018 those in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early and proper legislative resolution of the Korean claims .\nIn December 1999 the Supreme Court again rejected their claim , but , while leaving it to the legislature , expressed understanding of their discontent at the lack of any legislative measures to resolve their grievances .\nIn 2008 , responding to the urgings of the courts and the United Nations Human Rights Commission , the ( opposition ) Democratic Party of Japan framed a bill for the economic relief of the Korean senpan , prescribing a payment of three million yen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , it failed to persuade the then governing Liberal-Democratic Party and was dropped without debate .\nAnother bill , setting a slightly lower figure of 2.6 million yen per head , was proposed by the Japan-South Korea Parliamentarians League but got nowhere .\nYi Hak-Nae , the last survivor , continues to press the B- and C-groups \u2019 case and the legislature continues to drag its feet.19 \u2018 Not a day passes \u2019 , said Yi in 2020 , \u2018 without my thinking of the pitiable fate of those B- and C-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I insist that Japan respond properly to our claims \u2019 .\nShortly before he died in 1993 , Dunlop took me aside during a function at the Australian War Memorial to ask about Yi .\nWhenever he looked at the gold watch Yi had presented to him , he said , he felt a certain \u2018 guilt \u2019 .\nSurprised at his use of the word guilt , I put it to him that , given what he and other prisoners had been through at the hands of their captors , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe gently demurred .\nLeading me to a nearby chair , he sat me down and told me the following story .\nIt is one that , it seems , he had not told before , and one that many might find shocking , as did I. I quote here from the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 July 1993 ( though I am the source of this story ) :20 Sir Edward Dunlop died with guilt in a corner of his heart .\n\u2018 Weary \u2019 , the Australian hero who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed a few months before he died\u2026that he had once hated a man so intensely that he had planned to kill him .\nOn the Burma\u2013Thailand railway 50 years ago , the Australian surgeon had fashioned a club to kill the Korean guard known as the Lizard , whom Dunlop called in his diaries \u2018 a proper little bastard \u2019 .\nDunlop planned to ambush the Lizard and \u2018 beat his brains out \u2019 .\nThe moment Dunlop planned to go to the ambush site , however , he was summoned to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an astonishing revelation .\nIt should be corrected now in just one detail .\nAs I recall the conversation , Dunlop had actually taken up a position to carry out his plan , hiding behind a rock or a tree near the camp entrance to await Yi \u2019 s return , when he was suddenly called to the camp office .\nDunlop would have known very well that the act he contemplated would , had he carried it out , have attracted savage retaliation , not just on himself but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he implied , so boiling with rage and hatred as to be temporarily blind to such consequences .\nThe moment passed , but it left a weight on his conscience .\nWorlds apart in culture , status and life experience , Dunlop and Yi were linked by fate and shared humanity , each touched by the encounter with the other .\nMeeting Yi first at Hintok in early 1943 , Dunlop conceived of a hatred for him that he could only barely contain .\nFour years later , by choosing not to cooperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared \u2019 ( or , it could be said , re-spared ) Yi , his non-cooperation mute testimony to his disquiet .\nEventually , in 1991 , the two were reconciled , with an apology offered by Yi and accepted by Dunlop .\nThe reconciliation was sealed the following year by the gold watch .\nOn learning of Dunlop \u2019 s death , Yi sent a message of condolence : \u2026I owe you my life\u2026you were gracious enough to accept those apologies\u2026and you showed understanding of the position of Koreans under Japanese imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , you shook hands with me and the warmth of your large hand still remains with me .\nFrom my heart I thank you , and I pray that you may rest in peace.21 Yi is one of a tiny minority in Japan to apologise for his role in the war and to seek out those towards whom he feels particular guilt , even though his responsibility for what happened in the camp , including the deaths of \u2018 over 100 \u2019 Australians , was at least attenuated by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-year-old discriminated-against menial at the lowest level of the Japanese military machine .\nThat he was non-Japanese should also have been taken into consideration .\nFor the Koreans , Japan \u2019 s defeat in war spelt liberation and liquidation of Japan \u2019 s colonial empire .\nYi \u2019 s defence counsel at the 1947 trial attempted to make the defence that as an allied national he should not be tried as a Japanese ( enemy ) subject,22 but the court briskly dismissed that objection .\nIt was no more interested in the oppressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was in Yi \u2019 s being a juvenile .\nToday , Weary \u2019 s statue stands in front of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra .\nSeeing his image , recollecting his grasp of history , his personal warmth and his sense of justice , I bow in respect and remembrance .\nIn 1995 the government of Australia conferred upon him the extraordinary honour of minting 16 million 50-cent coins with Queen Elizabeth on one side and Weary on the other .\nI recall him speaking to the Canberra gathering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Japanese had an excuse for getting involved in the last war .\nI think the Americans put them down as a tinpot economy and really screwed them down as a minor power .\n[ But ] As one who was quite prepared to forgive the Japanese and get on with business with them in the world , one thing has just irritated me a little : they do not seem to me to really teach history.23 On 23 April 1993 , the book of the 1991 conference was launched at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keating , who spoke memorably and movingly to the assembled former POWs of his own family \u2019 s experience of wartime loss , his uncle having been a casualty of the Sandakan Death Marches in the Philippines in early 1945 .\nOnly long after the expiry of his allocated time could his minders detach the prime minister from his intimate conversations and shared family stories with the former soldiers .\nThese were years in which Hellfire Pass was gradually taking its place alongside Gallipoli and Kokoda as a key site in the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years since that 1991 conference and the 1993 book publication , one by one the participants , especially the old soldiers , have passed away .\nThe last survivor , Yi Hak-nae , can not be far behind .\nSince the publication of the 1991 conference proceedings , at least two major books have been published ; one was subsequently turned into a film and the other , Richard Flanagan \u2019 s Narrow Road to the Deep North , won the Booker Prize.24 The most substantial ( 865-page ) tome , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia \u2019 s War Crimes Trials 1945\u20131951 .\nEnjoying the financial backing of the Australian War Memorial , the Australian Research Council and the Australian Department of Defence \u2019 s Legal Division , it might be seen as the considered opinion of official Australia on the Singapore trials , a comprehensive \u2018 not guilty \u2019 ( to any suggestion of impropriety by Australia ) verdict .\nHowever , while one might reasonably have expected that important cases such as that of Yi would be given thorough analysis , that is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no mention is made of the fact that Yi was convicted in 1947 on charges that had been dismissed in 1946 , or of the contradictions and flimsy , hearsay character of the evidence .\nOther surely significant cases pass without analysis , including the \u2018 F \u2019 Force trials over matters arising from the camps on the Burma side of the railway , which recorded the highest of all prisoner death rates ( 29 per cent , or 1060 deaths among 3600 prisoners ) ,25 in which four death sentences were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuted ) .\nAnother large trial , of Lieutenant-Colonel Nagatomo Yoshitada and others , led to the execution of three Japanese , including Nagatomo , and three Koreans , one of whom , Cho Mun-san ( Japanese name : Hirahara Moritsune ) , was the subject of a documentary film by the national broadcaster , NHK , in August 1991.26 It too escapes mention .\nPosing the question \u2018 Were the Australian trials fair ?\n\u2019 , two of the editors of this volume offer their own answer , saying : \u2018 en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair as might be expected given the particular circumstances of the immediate postwar period and in comparison to other Allied military practices \u2019 27and \u2018 There is a certain satisfaction , as we come to the end of our project on the Australian war crimes trials , in attaining our conviction that no systematic abuse occurred in these trials \u2019 .28 Such a conclusion can only be reconciled with the Yi case ( and the F Force , Nagatomo and other cases ) by putting heavy weight on the words \u2018 en masse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 , and \u2018 systematic \u2019 .\nIt is a formula for forgiving abuses that were somehow less than en masse or \u2018 systematic \u2019 , while the phrase \u2018 as might be expected \u2019 is too conveniently exculpatory and too readily allows Australian responsibility to be diminished .\nFor what is clearly intended to be the \u2018 official history \u2019 , such equivocation is not good enough .\nThe conclusion of this volume that the trials were basically fair hangs as a heavily begged question over the promised \u2018 comprehensive law report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Australia \u2019 yet to come .\nI formed the view in 1991 , after reading the available documents and talking with survivors , that the trial of Yi ( and others , especially other Koreans ) was a travesty .\nNow , thirty years later , and contrary to the 2016 Australian volume , I see nothing to make me change my mind .\nFurthermore , reflecting on Yi Hak-nae \u2019 s long struggle to gain recognition and compensation from the government of Japan , I have a further , troubling concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim of some sort against the government of Australia over the deeply flawed judicial hearings to which it subjected

American Army headquarters .\nThe documents confirmed that it was the US and its puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the other way round , with the objective of crushing the local communist forces and then attacking China .\nTheir plan failed and ended in an American rout .\nBut what did surprise me was the evidence in the documents that the Americans also had the help and advice of Japanese Army officers who had remained in Korea at the end of the war between the US and Japan that ended in 1945 .\nTwo growing empires went to war in the Pacific against each other but in the end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing American empire in its drive for world domination and Korea was the first proof of their fealty to the US , a fealty tolerated not only because of their defeat but also because American capital and Japanese capital have the same interest ; the subjugation and exploitation of China .\nOn July 6 the Japanese Deputy Prime Minister stated at a Liberal Democratic Party function , that if China acted to take control of Taiwan , as is its right to do since it is an integral part of China , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an action by China would represent an \u201c existential threat to Japan.\n\u201d \u201c If a major incident happened , it \u2019 s safe to say it would be related to a situation threatening the survival of Japan .\nIf that is the case , Japan and the US must defend Taiwan together.\n\u201d Why it would be an \u201c existential threat to Japan \u201d he did not explain .\nThat he spoke for the leadership of Japan is clear .\nThat any interference in China \u2019 s actions in Taiwan would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Japanese Constitution that prohibits Japanese Self-Defence Forces from taking any offensive actions and a violation of the UN Charter is also clear .\nIn response China has stated time and again that it is prepared to defeat both the US and Japan if they try to interfere when China retakes control of Taiwan , which every action by the Americans and Taiwanese is provoking them to do .\nThe Americans recognise that they do not have enough strength in the region to interfere alone and so have lured Britain , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ever-eager Australians , to send in naval forces to the South China Sea to support the American and Japanese plans .\nIt is more than ironic to see four nations that were bitter enemies of Imperial Japan in World War II , now colluding with Japan to once again attack China and that Germany , an ally of Japan in the Second World War , once again is attempting to throw its weight around in the world .\nThe Chinese have a long and bitter memory of the Japanese invasion and occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 \u2019 s just as the Koreans have the same bitter memories of Japanese occupation .\nBut we realise now that the defeat of the fascists and militarists in Germany and Japan in 1945 was not their final defeat , for the governments who fought those two nations also had fascist elements within who hoped that the Nazis would crush communism in the USSR and the Japanese would do the same in China .\nInstead , the elements of world capital that supported or tolerated fascism and relied on imperialism to increase their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far right in Washington , created the NATO military alliance to continue the assault on the USSR and now on Russia , China and other independent nations .\nThey wear different clothes now , but use the same lies and techniques of propaganda as the Nazis and Japanese militarists as they prepare for another war against China and Russia .\nOn July 30 the Chinese government had to warn the British government and its naval task force , led by the new British aircraft carrier , Queen Elizabeth , to keep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences .\nYet , at the same time the US and France conducted military exercise with dozens of US F22s and French Rafale aircraft near Hawaii as the French beef up their forces in Tahiti , while the Americans have dispersed their fleet of bombers and fighters including F35s from their big base on Guam , which the Chinese can destroy quickly , to smaller bases , making it more difficult for China to destroy those aircraft .\nThis type of dispersal is usually seen in war settings , when war is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the Germans announced that they will be sending a frigate to the South China Sea in support of the Americans and Japanese , while the Americans sent more ships into the Taiwan Strait this week .\nSome may see all this as sabre rattling .\nBut that is a lot of sabres , and they are doing a lot more than just rattling them .\n\u201c The intensification of western manoeuvres and their growing focus on combat missions , which are highly realistic under current circumstances , coincide with prognoses by high-ranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war between the United States and China is probable in the near future .\nFor example , recently NATO \u2019 s former Supreme Allied Commander Europe ( SACEUR ) , Ret .\nAdm. James G. Stavridis , was quoted with the prognosis that \u201c our technology , network of allies and bases in the region , still overmatch China \u201d \u2013 for now .\nHowever , \u201c by the end of the decade \u2013 if not sooner \u201d the People \u2019 s Republic \u201c will be in a position \u201d to \u201c challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South China Sea.\n\u201d Recently Stavridis published a novel in which he depicted a fictional war erupting between the USA and China in 2034 .\nIn the meantime , he considers \u201c we may not have until 2034 to prepare for this battle \u2013 it may come much sooner.\n\u201d Some of his colleagues in the military are predicting that \u201c it is not about 2034 , \u201d the Big War could come earlier \u2013 possibly even \u201c 2024 or 2026.\n\u201d But it is not China that is seeking a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nThe propaganda machines in the west , all part of the military-industrial complex , are legion .\nBut one of the worst is the Hudson Institute , founded in 1961 by Herman Khan , formerly of the Rand Institute , who was famous for playing nuclear war games and theorising on the possibilities of using nuclear weapons in war .\nIts current leadership and membership include fascists like Mike Pompeo , Seth Cropsey and many others who served in various US government regimes or the US military establishment .\n\u201c Cropsey began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Defense as assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and subsequently served as deputy undersecretary of the Navy in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W .\nBush administrations , where he was responsible for the Navy \u2019 s position on efforts to reorganize DoD , development of the maritime strategy , the Navy \u2019 s academic institutions , naval special operations , and burden-sharing with NATO allies .\nIn the Bush administration , Cropsey moved to the Office of the Secretary of Defense ( OSD ) to become acting assistant secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict .\nCropsey served as a naval officer from 1985 to 2004 .\n\u201c From 1982 to 1984 , Cropsey directed the editorial policy of the Voice of America ( VOA ) on the solidarity movement in Poland , Soviet treatment of dissidents , and other issues .\nReturning to public diplomacy in 2002 as director of the US government \u2019 s International Broadcasting Bureau , Cropsey supervised the agency as successful efforts were undertaken to increase radio and television broadcasting to the Muslim world.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time anti-socialist propagandist and war criminal .\nCropsey penned a recent article published in The Hill , a US right wing journal covering events in Washington entitled , \u201c Japan Signals An Opening for US in Countering China \u201d in which he praised the statement by Taro Aso that Japan will support Taiwan in case of China acting to take control of its island , claimed that China seeks \u201c world dominance \u201d and predicted a war with the USA in the near future .\nHe further states that the Japanese have now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign and military policy , dismisses the Japanese constitutional prohibition on Japanese offensive actions and calls for Japan to increase it military forces and support to \u201c counter \u201d China .\n\u201c Defending Taiwan is a difficult proposition .\nThe PLA is at its strongest within the First Island Chain , particularly around Taiwan , given Beijing \u2019 s concentration of naval , air , and missile forces .\nTo defend the island , the US and its allies would have to operate squarely within China \u2019 s missile range , jeopardizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power depends .\n\u201c However , Japan and the US both field significant submarine fleets \u2014 Japan \u2019 s small but quiet battery-powered boats are an effective counterpart to America \u2019 s larger nuclear-powered attack submarines .\nSubmarines are immune to the missiles upon which the PLA would rely to gain sea and air control over Taiwan .\nIf supported by a sufficient fast-boat mining effort , and a robust enough network of mobile ground-launched anti-ship and anti-air missiles , a Japanese-American submarine surge could defeat a PLA invasion of Taiwan , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which China hopes .\nHe calls for more military exercises with the US and Japan , France , and Britain and their other allies to \u201c prepare for war.\n\u201d He then adds the lie that \u201c preparing for war is essential to deterring it \u201d when what he really means is that America is preparing for war in order to wage war .\nThe forces of peace and reason in the world must denounce these war preparations as a danger to the entire world for a war on China will bring in @

sanctions regime against Tehran , but their ties might soon improve judging by Iranian President Raisi \u2019 s latest remarks about the role that they can both play in establishing security in Afghanistan .\nThe Islamic Republic \u2019 s new leader met with Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar who traveled to the Tehran to attend his inauguration .\nAccording to the English-language version of the official Twitter account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran : \u201c [ President Raisi ] stressed the importance of close cooperation and coordination between the two countries in developing peace and stability in the region , and said , \u2018 # Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region , especially Afghanistan , and Tehran welcomes the New Delhi \u2019 s role in establishment of security in # Afghanistan .\nThe fate of Afghanistan must be decided by the Afghans themselves , and we believe that if the Americans do not sabotage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly.\n\u2019 \u201d It \u2019 s noteworthy that India and Iran are voluntarily excluded from the Extended Troika on Afghanistan consisting of Russia , Pakistan , China , and the US due to the former \u2019 s unwillingness to publicly talk to the Taliban ( which Moscow requires as a precondition for participating ) and the latter \u2019 s well-known ideological and political disagreements with the US .\nThis places them in a similar strategic situation with respect to the Afghan peace process and thus sets the stage for them to work more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this conflict so long as Tehran has the political will to do so .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely that they \u2019 d be able to pull a page from the 1990s-era playbook by arming anti-Taliban groups since that organization controls a significant share of Afghanistan \u2019 s borders .\nEven so , President Raisi \u2019 s praise of India \u2019 s \u201c constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region , especially Afghanistan \u201d hints that his principalist ( \u201c conservative \u201d ) government might surprisingly allow Indian overflights through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying Kabul and its anti-Taliban allies despite Tehran previously hosting the Taliban as recently as last month for peace talks .\nAfter all , that \u2019 s the only relevant role that India is playing \u201c in ( the ) establishment of security in Afghanistan.\n\u201d At the same time , however , President Raisi also predicted that \u201c if the Americans do not sabotage the situation , this issue will be resolved quickly.\n\u201d What \u2019 s so curious about his second remark is that it can also be interpreted as suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its airspace for that purpose since the internationally recognized Afghan government is also officially an American ally .\nIn other words , that exact scenario might arguably contribute to US efforts to \u201c sabotage the situation \u201d and thus prove counterproductive .\nIn other words , Iran is employing its stereotypical strategic ambiguity honed from millennia of diplomatic practice in order to confuse its target audience , which in this case consists of the US & India on one side and Russia & Pakistan on the other .\nThe message intended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible with its foreign policy and wouldn \u2019 t mind indirectly aiding their anti-Taliban efforts in exchange for a much-needed pressure valve from Washington \u2019 s unilateral sanctions regime .\nIn practice , this could take the form of the US lifting some of those restrictions in parallel with India investing more in the North-South Transport Corridor ( NSTC ) .\nAs for second targeted pair of countries , Iran intends for them to receive this message as well so that they compete with the first pair in offering the Islamic Republic the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of action .\nIt shouldn \u2019 t be forgotten that although Iran recently hosted the Taliban , Tehran still deeply distrusts the group after it murdered nearly a dozen of its diplomats in 1998 and is accused of abusing Afghanistan \u2019 s majority-Shiite Hazara minority .\nWhereas the US and India can offer Iran economic incentives , Russia and Pakistan can perhaps counter with political and security ones connected to that conflict \u2019 s outcome .\nThe stance of Iran \u2019 s new 25-year Chinese strategic partners doesn \u2019 t seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s deliberately ambiguous messaging regarding this scenario .\nThe People \u2019 s Republic is against any perpetuation of the Afghan Civil War , especially that which is externally driven such as what India and Iran might be contemplating with a wink from the US , but it \u2019 s also unable to stop Tehran if it commits to doing this .\nChina would prefer to most directly connect with Iran via the \u201c Persian Corridor \u201d through Tajikistan and Afghanistan , but this route could just be replaced with W-CPEC+ if made unviable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China could also informally dangle certain investment incentives to encourage Iran to move away from that scenario such as promising to accelerate the start of certain projects in exchange for ignoring India \u2019 s presumably US-approved Afghan-directed security outreaches , but it \u2019 s unclear whether that \u2019 ll happen .\nFor this reason , it \u2019 s difficult at this moment to predict exactly what Iran \u2019 s new government will do since there are pros and cons to each course of action .\nIdeally , Russia and Pakistan would ensure Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-war Afghanistan , the US would lift the sanctions , and India would invest more in the NSTC .\nThat \u2019 s unrealistic to expect , though , so Iran will likely have to commit to one of those two scenarios .\nIt can either facilitate India \u2019 s presumably US-approved \u201c establishment of security in Afghanistan \u201d by approving New Delhi \u2019 s overflights through its airspace to militarily supply Kabul and its anti-Taliban allies , or it can ensure that this doesn \u2019 t happen ( or scale back and ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on like some suspect ) .\nThe second course of action is arguably the best for regional stability but Iran \u2019 s economy is really struggling right now so its new principalist ( \u201c conservative \u201d ) government might be tempted to seriously consider India \u2019 s

crisis began , but the driving forces behind them are cynically taking advantage of the current crisis to draw more people out into what were otherwise unpopular , artificial opposition movements .\nThe protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call an \u201c ASEAN Spring \u201d or \u201c Asian Spring , \u201d and have adopted symbols and slogans common across the regional protests .\nProtest leaders refer to this collective , regional movement as the \u201c Milk Tea Alliance , \u201d propped up by several common pillars .\nThe BBC in its article , \u201c Milk Tea Alliance : Twitter creates emoji for pro-democracy activists , \u201d would claim : The alliance has brought together anti-Beijing protesters in Hong Kong and Taiwan with pro-democracy campaigners in Thailand and Myanmar .\nThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements that were deliberately unmentioned by the BBC including US government funding behind each and every opposition movement .\nIt is no secret the US seeks to encircle and contain Chian \u2013 sponsoring \u201c anti-Beijing \u201d movements across Asia obviously fits into that strategy .\nThe fact that a US-based social media corporation \u2013 Twitter \u2013 has as a matter of company policy decided to endorse and promote the movement should raise immediate concern .\nTwitter , along with other US-based tech giants like Facebook and Google ( which owns YouTube ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping to advance US foreign policy objectives for over a decade now .\nThe 2011 \u201c Arab Spring \u201d provided a stark example of not only US interference and even military intervention ushered in by engineered uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) , but also an example of US-based tech giants \u2019 role in helping .\nThe New York Times in its article , \u201c U.S .\nGroups Helped Nurture Arab Uprisings , \u201d would note the role of US government funding in building up and unleashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the groups and individuals directly involved in the revolts and reforms sweeping the region , including the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt , the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and grass-roots activists like Entsar Qadhi , a youth leader in Yemen , received training and financing from groups like the International Republican Institute , the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House , a nonprofit human rights organization based in Washington , according to interviews in recent weeks and American diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks .\nThe New York Times would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in helping train , organize , and unleash unrest across MENA , stating : Some Egyptian youth leaders attended a 2008 technology meeting in New York , where they were taught to use social networking and mobile technologies to promote democracy .\nAmong those sponsoring the meeting were Facebook , Google , MTV , Columbia Law School and the State Department .\nThen US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would address the \u201c technology meetings \u201d in prerecorded messages played in front of participants .\nIn one address , recorded in 2009 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanguard of a rising generation of citizen activists who are using the latest technological tools to catalyze change , build movements , and transform lives and I hope this conference provides an opportunity for you to learn from each other and discover the tools and techniques that will open new doors for activism and empowerment when you return home all over the world .\nOf course , upon returning home to MENA \u2013 and amid regional economic turmoil \u2013 these US-funded , trained , and equipped opposition groups drew dissatisfied people into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime change across the region .\nA portent of just how far the US sought to take its \u201c Arab Spring \u201d was revealed by late US Senator John McCain .\nIn The Atlantic \u2019 s 2011 article , \u201c The Arab Spring : \u2018 A Virus That Will Attack Moscow and Beijing \u2019 , \u201d McCain would be quoted as saying : A year ago , Ben-Ali and Gaddafi were not in power .\nAssad won \u2019 t be in power this time next year .\nThis Arab Spring is a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had Russia not intervened in Syria in 2015 , the nation may have fallen .\nThe US \u2019 proxy militant force would have moved onward to Iran and then to southern Russia and into western China where US efforts were already long underway to spark violent separatism in both regions .\nThe blunting of Washington \u2019 s \u201c Arab Spring \u201d campaign meant that attempts to light additional regions on fire \u2013 Eastern Europe to Russia \u2019 s west and along China \u2019 s periphery in Southeast Asia \u2013 were slow-going .\nAttempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar , and Thailand were blunted over the years by a combination of short-term political concessions and domestic military intervention .\nToday , however , like before the \u201c Arab Spring \u201d transformed into regional war , economic crisis looms over the region and dissatisfaction among the population driven by a crisis ASEAN governments were not responsible for and have little ability to control is being eagerly exploited by US-backed opposition groups .\nASEAN governments and policies of lockdowns have caused dissatisfaction .\nBut this would not be enough to create dangerous destabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure on the information battlefield that risks making the crisis worse .\nASEAN has failed to secure its information space .\nEach individual ASEAN member save for Cambodia and Vietnam , have had their information space entirely monopolized by US-backed media platforms and US-based social media networks .\nFacebook and Twitter have openly involved themselves in the internal political affairs of both Thailand and Myanmar in recent months in support of US-backed protests .\nAfter Myanmar \u2019 s military took power in February , Twitter and Facebook swiftly moved to remove the accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example would exclaim : Today , we are banning the remaining Myanmar military ( \u201c Tatmadaw \u201d ) and military-controlled state and media entities from Facebook and Instagram , as well as ads from military-linked commercial entities .\nIn Thailand , Twitter in an official announcement would claim : Our investigation uncovered a network of accounts partaking in information operations that we can reliably link to the Royal Thai Army ( RTA ) .\nThese accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content , as well as engaging in behavior targeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the term \u201c reliably link \u201d means Twitter had no evidence .\nIn reality , it was simply purging accounts retweeting and liking posts made by official Thai military accounts .\nMeanwhile , Twitter not only allows the open abuse of its platform by the US-backed opposition to carry out actual coordinated inauthentic behavior , it also openly encourages Thai Twitter users to break Thai criminal defamation laws .\nIn an announcement made in May 2021 , Twitter would tell Thai users that its regulations did not recognize Thai defamation laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link those charged under Thai law with organizations providing free legal aid .\nThese included US government-funded \u201c Thai Lawyers for Human Rights \u201d and \u201c iLaw.\n\u201d The goal is to undermine both Thai law and the social stability Thai law seeks to maintain .\nWhile US-based social media networks have been quick to suspend accounts questioning Western COVID-19 policies or Western pharmaceutical corporations and their vaccines \u2013 these same networks allow disinformation to spread like wildfire across ASEAN especially in regards to claims involving China \u2019 s Sinovac vaccine and disinformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of the crisis .\nThe goal is to fan the flames of fear , hysteria , and more importantly , anger , to help boost attendance at wavering street protests backed by the US and to redirect national energy from overcoming the current crisis toward destabilizing the region further .\nPartly because of COVID-19 , the opportunity for an otherwise unlikely US gambit of destabilizing ASEAN and encircling China with either hostile US client regimes , or destabilized failed states now exists .\nBut it is also partly \u2013 and perhaps mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure its information space .\nA war is now raging on a battlefield ASEAN governments have no soldiers on , and it is losing .\nASEAN nations have increasingly turned to Russia and China to meet more traditional national security threats , purchasing military equipment like tanks , warplanes , helicopters , and naval vessels .\nHowever , Russia and China \u2013 who have successfully defended their

.\nIndonesia \u2019 s plan to phase out coal is a mere rebranding of an existing timeline to decommission aging plants , with no meaningful shift toward actually quitting the fossil fuel , a new report says .\nState-owned utility PLN announced in May that it would start shutting down coal-fired power plants and phasing them all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capacity , with a view to net-zero carbon emissions by 2060 .\nBut on closer scrutiny , there \u2019 s no early retirement of coal plants in sight and more than 40 new plants are still expected to be built , according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis ( IEEFA ) , a Jakarta-based think tank .\nA review of the announced numbers and the existing data and planning documents show that the plant retirement and net-zero emissions plans , though sounding \u201c very promising \u201d and looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c simply putting a new face on old plans , \u201d the IEEFA says in a report .\nThis sends a mixed signal to the world and to investors , which subsequently could deter investment in clean energy , something the country badly needs in order to transition away from dirty coal to renewable energy , experts warn .\n\u201c It looked like the net-zero [ emissions ] policy is progressive , but if you dissect it , the content doesn \u2019 t give a strong enough signal that this is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a researcher at Trend Asia , an NGO that focuses on clean energy transition .\nMongabay reached out to PLN for comment but did not receive a response .\nFor one thing , PLN \u2019 s announcement that it would retire all coal-fired power plants by 2055 gives the impression that some plants would be decommissioned earlier than their expected end of life .\nBut the retirement plan simply highlights existing plans for an orderly decommissioning of sub-scale and antiquated coal facilities , in line with diminishing returns from these plants .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been cited for retirement are those that are on track to be decommissioned anyway due to their old age .\n\u201c So this is not early retirement , \u201d IEEFA energy finance analyst Elrika Hamdi said during a webinar .\n\u201c All steam power plants will be retired in accordance with their respective ages and their contracts .\nSo this is not something new.\n\u201d The first four plants to be retired , in 2030 , will have been in service for 50 to 60 years by then ; by industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long overdue .\n\u201c Planning to retire 50- to 60-year-old units is far from being ambitious , even within a purely competitive electricity market , \u201d the IEEFA said in its report .\nElrika said PLN should be retiring those four plants well before 2030 .\nWith no early retirement in sight , all coal plants are still on track to operate for their projected economic or contractual life , with PLN saying that both existing plants and those expected to come online will operate for their \u201c natural economic life.\n\u201d Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still relatively new , this means the country \u2019 s power grid will still be dominated by coal for the foreseeable future , with coal plants typically operating for 25 to 30 years .\nIn its report , the IEEFA asked what would happen with these plants after they are retired and whether the decommissioning would include remediation of environmental impacts that the plants have caused during their operation .\nThe IEEFA also questioned whether PLN , which has a monopoly on the national grid , has the technical or financial resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international standards .\n\u201c What steps have been taken by PLN to prepare for the decommissioning [ of the plants ] ?\n\u201d Elrika said .\n\u201c Because we don \u2019 t know if PLN has experience in decommissioning or not .\nBecause it \u2019 s not only about retiring coal power plants , but also about environmental remediation.\n\u201d Eddy Soeparno , deputy chair of the national parliament \u2019 s oversight committee for energy , said PLN is carrying out a study on how to monetize retired coal plants , one option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Java and Sumatra to other parts of the country .\nThe two islands have an oversupply of electricity , given the rush to build new coal plants in recent years .\n\u201c But [ we ] have to think about this [ option ] looking ahead because coal [ consumption ] has been limited and [ planned to be ] reduced to zero , \u201d Eddy said as quoted by local media .\n\u201c How far can PLN benefit from coal plant assets ?\nBecause they \u2019 re related to financial responsibility.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal in front of a coal firing power plant in the Netherlands .\nImage by Adrem68/Wikimedia Commons .\nThen there \u2019 s also the fact that PLN still plans to build new coal plants .\nIn touting its carbon neutrality goals earlier this year , the government announced a plan to stop building new coal plants after an ongoing program to add 35 GW to the national grid \u2014 powered mostly by coal \u2014 is completed .\nThe government said only coal plants that are under construction or for which financing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Joko Widodo .\nThis prompted speculation that the government was finally reevaluating the controversial 35 GW program , according to the IEEFA report .\nHowever , PLN deputy CEO Darmawan Prasodjo said 21 GW of coal capacity will still come online , which includes planned plants for which financing has been finalized .\nAnalysis by the IEEFA , meanwhile , suggests there are at least 44 coal plants with a total capacity of nearly 16 GW in the pipeline between 2021 and 2030 , with the biggest ones planned for Java @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning because there has been overcapacity [ of electricity ] in the Java-Bali and Sumatra grids in the past few years , \u201d Elrika said .\n\u201c We have to be critical .\nWhen we \u2019 re adding more plants in already congested [ grids ] , this uses subsidy and compensation money [ from the government ] , and that \u2019 s our tax money.\n\u201d Andri of Trend Asia called the moratorium on new coal plants a \u201c half-hearted \u201d commitment to fighting climate change , given that these new coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year for decades to come .\nFrom the 44 coal plants already in the pipeline , there was around 4.1 GW of capacity that was still in the financing phase as of the end of 2020 , according to IEEFA .\nThis means that unless there \u2019 s been progress in the first six months of 2021 , these plants have not achieved financial closure and may be cancelled .\nTwo of the projects \u2014 Tanjung Jati and Indramayu \u2014 haven \u2019 t secured financing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were included in the government \u2019 s power planning program in 2010 .\nElrika said these projects should be scrapped per the president \u2019 s instruction , especially projects that have been in the pipeline for more than five years but still haven \u2019 t secured financial backing .\nThis , at least , would be a starting point , she said .\nShe added independent power producers \u2014 private sector developers that build plants and sell the electricity to PLN \u2014 must realize that it \u2019 s getting increasingly difficult to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 financial institutions around the world have adopted stricter investment policies to steer clear of coal , whether mining or power generation .\n\u201c When these financial institutions are already out [ of the coal business ] , who wants to fund \u201d these plant projects that are still in the pipeline , Elrika asked .\nCancellation , though not really Even when unfeasible projects are cancelled , that \u2019 s not necessarily a mark of progress in the move away from coal , observers say .\nThe Indonesian government recently announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said weren \u2019 t making any progress .\nHowever , the IEEFA pointed out that 10 of the 12 plants were actually cancelled two years ago in PLN \u2019 s electricity procurement plan .\nAnd since these plants , with combined capacity of 177 megawatts , are small in scale \u2014 with poor operating efficiencies and high emissions \u2014 their cancellation has limited impact on overall carbon emissions targets .\n\u201c If PLN is serious [ about achieving carbon neutrality ] , then give [ us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ that will be cancelled ] , \u201d Andri said .\n\u201c We need to know which ones will be cancelled , especially the big ones.\n\u201d The IEEFA said there are indications the government will cancel 6.8 GW of new coal power based on the draft of this year \u2019 s procurement plan .\nThese projects \u201c have either been modified and changed to renewable baseload or shifted to other sources of generation or postponed until further notice , \u201d the IEEFA said in its report .\nElrika questioned why PLN and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential cancellation of the 6.8 GW of coal power .\n\u201c This is something that should be celebrated , but it \u2019 s not being put into the spotlight , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Instead , [ the government ] focuses on small things , like the cancellation of problematic little plants of 177 MW.\n\u201d Villagers playing volleyball in the Suralaya village with the Suralaya coal power plant in the background in Cilegon city , Banten Province , Indonesia .\nImage by Ulet Ifansasti / Greenpeace .\nIsabella Suarez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research on Energy and Clean Air ( CREA ) , said an example of a big project that would have a significant impact on the country \u2019 s emissions is the Java 9 and 10 coal plants .\nThe $ 3.5 billion project , funded mainly by South Korean public financing agencies , is an expansion of the Suralaya coal-fired power plant complex , located in Banten province , Java .\nWith eight units already in operation , the industrial complex is the largest and most polluting in all of Southeast Asia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional 2 GW of installed electricity capacity in Indonesia , dwarfing other coal projects in the pipeline .\nThe project has been mired in controversy and faced opposition from local communities and environmentalists since its inception .\nThey question the need to build more polluting plants in a region that already has a surplus of electricity .\nThe power plants are located approximately 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) northwest of Jakarta , in a region that already hosts 22 coal-fired power plants .\nBanten province as a whole has 52 coal power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the environmental and health impacts of the new plants , with residents complaining that existing units have already caused problems for public health , agriculture and water .\nProponents of the project say the two plants will be built using ultra-supercritical technology , which uses less coal to generate a unit of electricity , and hence emits less carbon and other pollutants than older plants .\nOnce they \u2019 re up and running , the two plants will emit levels of nitrous oxides , sulfur oxides and dust lower than Indonesian standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 10 times as high as the similar Gangneung Eco coal-fired plant being built in South Korea , the country underwriting and building the Java 9 and 10 plants .\nModeling done by Greenpeace in 2019 on the health impacts of the project show the two plants will cause 4,700 premature deaths over their lifetime if they stay within the Indonesian government \u2019 s emission limits .\nAnd even if they were built to comply with South Korean standards , they would still cost 500 to 1,500 lives over their 30-year lifetime .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-supercritical plants , but if you look at their EIAs [ environmental impact assessments ] , that \u2019 s not going to help with the emissions that they \u2019 re going to have in the area , \u201d CREA \u2019 s Suarez said .\nShe said a more ambitious coal phaseout policy and drastic policy reform in Indonesia will send a clear signal to investors that the country is ready and eager to quit its coal addiction and develop clean renewable energy .\n\u201c PLN \u2019 s ambition is an important indicator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero goal seriously , \u201d Suarez said .\n\u201c So I agree a more ambitious PLN plan is needed to really firm up what Indonesia wants to do moving forward.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward

post-Olympics euphoria to an easy victory .\nYet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSuga \u2019 s approval rating is , at best , in the low 30s as a fourth Covid-19 wave upends the nation .\nGrowth is slowing anew as the sugar high from last year \u2019 s US $ 2 trillion of public stimulus wears off .\nAnd this is all 11-plus months under Suga proved even less productive in reforming the economy than his predecessor Shinzo Abe .\nPut these narratives together and it \u2019 s an open question whether Suga can hang on to power \u2013 although the odds are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s one saving grace is that major opposition parties that weren \u2019 t much of a threat pre-Covid seem no more emboldened today .\nAt least that is how matters look now \u2013 though ongoing pandemic fallout could , feasibly , create an opening for the LDP to lose power , as it did briefly in 2009 .\nSuga \u2019 s own hold on power could prove tenuous if the Tokyo Olympics turns out to be the super-spreader event

considerable blowback for Suga \u2019 s fragile government , for as Japan \u2019 s 126 million people experience their fourth state of emergency , Covid fatigue is setting in .\nAnd so are economic headwinds , which are sure to crimp household spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sure to depress wages and make for even less generous bonus seasons than in 2020 .\nThe financial hangover from the Olympics

holding a largely spectator-free event after a year of delays with extreme health protocols .\nEconomist Takahide Kiuchi at Nomura Research Institute reckons that the absence of spectators in the @ @

into an election .\nAt the very least it creates an opening for Suga \u2019 s LDP rivals to become prime minister in an intra-party election to be held in September .\nSuga seems to grasp that he has a popularity problem .\nIn July , he decided not to stump for LDP candidates for a Tokyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the party head .\nOther party leaders seemed emboldened by Suga \u2019 s absence .\nIn their

recent stint as minister of administrative and regulatory reform has impressed few .\nHis initial moves to reduce red tape had epic pushback from bureaucrats .\nA case in point was their stubborn championing of fax machines .\nEfforts to digitalize Japan \u2019 s ministries called for the mass phasing out of these 20th-century relics , but Kono did not manage it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-school Hanko stamps on documents is a work in progress , at best .\nNor has Kono \u2019 s role since January in spearheading Japan \u2019 s Covid-19 vaccination processwon him many kudos .\nThough Japan has

.\nShigeru Ishiba , a foreign policy hawk , also appears to be angling for a stint as prime minister .\nBut even if the LDP hangs on to power , it \u2019 s likely to have a tenuous public mandate .\nThat augurs poorly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe years are being viewed more and more as a cautionary tale in lost leadership opportunities .\nFrom December 2012 to September 2020 , Suga was there every step of the way as Abe \u2019 s chief cabinet secretary .\nAbe took office with a bold plan to end deflation by curbing bureaucracy , loosening labor markets , increasing innovation and productivity , empowering women and attracting more foreign talent .\nImportantly , Abe had three attributes no other Japanese leader did before : majorities in both houses of parliament ; high approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in office to implement a revival scheme that had strong public support .\nBut Abe largely trod water , fobbing off said economic matters to the Bank of Japan .\nAnd his failure to use nearly eight years in power to good effect left Japan highly vulnerable to Covid-19 fallout .\nThis explains why Japan is struggling to keep consumer prices out of the red while the rest of the globe faces

weaker one ?\nEconomists also find it troubling that the LDP seems more inclined to talk about defending Taiwan than a domestic economy losing altitude .\nEven Abe has pivoted back to the spotlight to join the growing chorus of LDP officials voicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolls Taipei \u2019 s government .\nMost pundits see it as a way of diverting attention away from domestic concerns .\nSome , though , can \u2019 t help but wonder if Abe is angling for a third shot at the premiership .\nAs the election looms , Suga seems to be forgetting that in the digital age , a vibrant and innovative economy

: On Aug. 10 , the village governments of Naboay and Malay publicly released resolutions opposing the hydroelectric project , citing concerns about the project \u2019 s potential impacts on the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park , municipal and agricultural water supplies , and the area \u2019 s indigenous Ati communities .\nActivists and local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at a recently announced plan to build a hydroelectric plant overlapping with a national park that \u2019 s home to rare and threatened species .\nStrategic Power Development Corporation ( SPDC ) , a subsidiary of Philippine mega conglomerate San Miguel Corporation , announced on July 13 its intention to build the $ 500 million , 300-megawatt pump-storage hydro facility in Malay municipality on the island of Panay .\nThe project would include the construction of two dams and reservoirs , 9.6 kilometers ( 6 miles ) of new roads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mi ) of existing roads .\nAccording to SPDC , the planned project near the confluence of the Nabaoy and Imbaroto rivers would consist of a 70-meter ( 230-foot ) lower dam on the Naboay , with a 10.2-million-cubic-meter ( 2.7-billion-gallon ) reservoir ; and a 74 m ( 243 ft ) upper dam with a 4.55-million-m3 ( 1.2-billion-gallon ) reservoir extending to the Imbaroto .\nThe company says the plant will provide energy to the regional grid to meet current and future peak demand , will support the local economy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s 2017-2040 Philippine Energy Plan .\nOverall , the company says the complex would cover 122.7 hectares ( 303.2 acres ) , including 97.9 hectares ( 241.9 acres ) of forest , of which 24.9 hectares ( 61.5 acres ) are nominally protected land within Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park .\nNorthwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park , which spans 12,009 hectares ( 29,676 acres ) in the provinces of Aklan and Antique , was established in 2002 via a presidential proclamation .\nHome to critically endangered Visayan warty pigs ( Sus cebifrons ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as endangered Visayan hornbills ( Penelopides panini ) , it has been locally recognized as a significant biodiversity hotspot since the 1990s .\nThe park holds some of the last remaining stands of primary lowland rainforest in the central Philippines , and serves as a key watershed providing potable water to Panay and neighboring islands .\nActivists say the hydropower project puts water supplies for local communities at risk .\n\u201c The Nabaoy River is the lone source of potable water to nearby Boracay Island and to the residents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aklan Trekkers Group .\nBoracay Island , separated from the park by a narrow strait , is a prime beach destination , recording 2 million tourist arrivals in 2019 .\n\u201c I wonder how will they supply water to the residents especially during construction phase .\nDuring construction phase , for sure , large vehicles will be damaging the forest and the company seems do not have a clear alternative on how to restore what has been damaged , \u201d Cahilig said .\nThe natural park is also home to a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish in the Nabaoy River and rely on the forests for sustenance .\nActivists have also questioned the need for additional electrical capacity in the area .\nCiting reports from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines , Melvin Purzuelo of the Green Forum-Western Visayas noted that from July 20-26 , Panay Island \u2019 s average daily electricity consumption ranged from 345-364 MW , against existing capacity of 480 MW .\n\u201c It is clear now that a huge power supply is not needed at this time especially that the world is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said during a recent webinar .\nThe Naboay River , site of a proposed dam , is the primary source of potable water for the resort island of Boracay as well as the residents of Malay , Aklan .\nImage courtesy of Richard Cahilig/Aklan Trekkers .\nSPDC \u2019 s proposal still requires approval from local governments and the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources ( DENR ) .\n\u201c The Malay [ municipal government ] have set a coordination meeting with the SPDC supposedly last August 2 to clarify issues involving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic , \u201d Purzuelo said .\nLocal officials have distanced themselves from endorsing the proposal .\nIn a phone interview , acting Malay Mayor Floribar Bautista said the SPDC had not approached him to discuss the details of the project since he assumed his post in July 2018 .\n\u201c What I know is the project was endorsed by the previous administration .\nWhen I checked the documents , it \u2019 s lacking .\nIt seems the project may have [ been ] railroaded .\nI could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I do not know how the project would affect our town .\nAll they have to do is to convince me if the hydro dam project is worth it , \u201d he said .\nThe village of Nabaoy is also reportedly set to cancel its previous endorsement of the project , activists say .\nNo official cancellation had been issued as of the time this article was published ; but just as in the case of the Malay municipal government , the previous leadership of Nabaoy village had endorsed the project in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval from the current local governments , the project can only push through with special permission from the DENR .\nRebecca Tandug , of the Philippine Initiative for Environmental Conservation ( Philincon ) , said her organization will maintain its opposition to the project and

investments the Chinese government is making in both areas .\nThese bills would pour billions into research and development in the coming years , while also pushing for more accountability on human rights abuses in China .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they \u2019 re expected to in the coming months \u2014 and they \u2019 re indicative of a renewed focus in Congress on confronting the Chinese government more directly .\nCombating the Chinese government \u2019 s economic , scientific , and technological inroads has long been a focus of both political parties .\nBut the way lawmakers have framed the importance of checking the Chinese government \u2014 from proposing sweeping legislation aimed at blocking Chinese students from studying STEM fields in the US to remarks casting the country as an \u201c existential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns from activists and foreign policy experts who worry that the rhetoric and tone of such efforts will further stoke already high anti-Asian sentiment .\nWhile there \u2019 s overwhelming agreement that a more robust focus on American scientific and technological development is needed to ensure a strong economic future for the US \u2014 and that it \u2019 s vital to hold the Chinese government accountable , especially on human rights issues like the mass internment of the Uyghur minority \u2014 lawmakers need to be extremely careful when talking about competition with China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xenophobia .\nSuch xenophobia , stoked in part by the anti-China rhetoric of former President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers at the beginning of the pandemic , has already caused a lot of harm .\nFor example , Trump \u2019 s repeated decision to use terms such as the \u201c China virus \u201d has been linked to increasing anti-Asian sentiment over the last year .\nSince spring 2020 , the organization Stop AAPI Hate has received more than 6,600 reports of anti-Asian incidents ranging from verbal abuse to physical attacks , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes clear how tension between the US government and Asian countries can lead to hostility toward Asian American people .\nThat trend was apparent in past conflicts as well , including when Chinatowns were attacked during the Korean War in the 1950s and when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps during World War II solely on the basis of their ethnicity .\n\u201c Anti-China rhetoric reinforces yellow peril fears of Asians in the US and results in exclusionary policies and racial attacks , \u201d said Russell Jeung , a professor of Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Orientalist perspective , the east is foreign , difficult , dangerous \u2014 that shapes both our foreign policy and shapes how we are treated domestically.\n\u201d Given the circumstances , it \u2019 s important for lawmakers to call out the Chinese government and bolster US resources while being sensitive to concerns about fueling racist sentiment .\nUS attempts to spur growth should not hurt Asian American people in the process .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a fine balance that you have to play in both holding China and its policies accountable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be concerned about US-China relations and domestic race relations , \u201d Jeung said .\nDemocrats and Republicans are both focused on \u201c competition with China \u201d Addressing competition with the Chinese government is among the few areas that has garnered bipartisan consensus in recent months .\nThis past spring , the Innovation and Competition Act \u2014 one of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2019 s top priorities \u2014 overwhelmingly passed the Senate and was praised by President Joe Biden , who touted the \u201c generational investments \u201d it made .\nThe measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competitive edge in general , while citing the importance of countering the technological progress and rise of China in particular .\nIt contains more than $ 200 billion in funding , including money for research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence , semiconductors , and robotics .\nWhile the focus on research and development isn \u2019 t troubling in itself , the repeated framing of pro-innovation measures like this as \u201c anti-China \u201d bills has prompted concerns \u2014 including among some Asian American lawmakers \u2014 that such rhetoric taps into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China virus \u201d previously did .\n\u201c [ Lawmakers ] calling it the China Bill is disturbing to me , \u201d said Rep. Judy Chu ( D-CA ) , the head of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus ( CAPAC ) .\n\u201c That to me is Cold War rhetoric \u2026 and it is portraying China as the sole and key enemy.\n\u201d Both parties \u2019 sweeping remarks about the legislation risk amplifying existing anti-Asian sentiments .\n\u201c If [ Biden ] decides to step up \u2014 he and his administration \u2014 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I look forward to working with him on making sure that we out-innovate , out-compete and out-grow the Chinese and also starve them of the capital that they need to continue to build their slaveholder state and their blue-water navy , \u201d Sen. Todd Young ( R-IN ) has previously said .\n\u201c I have watched China take advantage of us in ways legal and illegal over the years , \u201d Schumer ( D-NY ) said in a Washington Post interview about the Innovation and Competition Act .\nSuch statements echo a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about China in the past .\nOften , the threat facing the US is described as \u201c China \u201d or \u201c the Chinese , \u201d in an extremely broad sense , conflating the Chinese government with the Chinese people .\nSuch rhetoric makes it seem like all Chinese people \u2014 and sometimes even members of the diaspora \u2014 should be considered threats to Americans , rather than the Chinese government .\nAs a report by Justice is Global , a project by the advocacy group People \u2019 s Action , detailed , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the China government can rapidly translate to anti-Asian sentiment domestically .\nInflammatory comments about China as an economic threat , for instance , can spur anti-Asian sentiments that blame Asian Americans for an individual \u2019 s loss of employment .\nCongressional bills are only the latest measures to prompt scrutiny .\n\u201c When you see China , these are fierce people in terms of negotiation .\nThey want to take your throat out , they want to cut you apart , \u201d Trump previously said on Good Morning America in 2015 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past for describing Trump as someone who \u201c rolled over for the Chinese , \u201d in a campaign ad .\nActivists have also flagged prior comments made by FBI Director Christopher Wray , who has said that the challenges posed by China are a \u201c whole of society \u201d problem , a statement that seemed to imply that Chinese people overall were broadly to blame for national security threats .\n\u201c If we constantly evoke \u2018 China \u2019 instead of specific parties , issues , or actions , then we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Aryani Ong , co-founder of the Asian American Federal Employees for Nondiscrimination .\n\u201c What I \u2019 m concerned about is the harm to Asian Americans who are swept up by a negative public reaction to anything related to China .\nWe saw this play out during Covid with the spike in hate and violence toward Asian Americans.\n\u201d In government and in the press , leaders \u2019 policies are sometimes referred to by the country they represent .\nBut in the case of China , there is a history of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants , and the known pattern of associating US-Asia conflict with Asian Americans .\nBecause of the pervasiveness of the \u201c forever foreigner \u201d stereotype \u2014 the idea that the loyalties of all Asian people in the US lie elsewhere \u2014 anti-China sentiment can very quickly spur xenophobia domestically .\nIn guidance that the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus has released to lawmakers regarding the rhetoric about bills addressing competition , the group pointed this problem out explicitly .\n\u201c While it is common to refer to the actions of a government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of rising anti-Asian hate , doing so can stoke xenophobia and hate , \u201d they write .\n\u201c This can be construed as implying that the Chinese people and Chinese Americans are enemies of the United States who seek to harm us.\n\u201d To avoid this , CAPAC recommends specificity : for example , using terms like \u201c Chinese government , \u201d or \u201c Beijing , \u201d in lieu of \u201c China.\n\u201d Michael Swaine , the director of the East Asia program at the think tank the Quincy Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field have been discussing .\nHe adds that he \u2019 s been concerned about how often lawmakers use phrases including \u201c existential threat \u201d as broad descriptors for China , which can set up an \u201c us versus them \u201d mentality .\n\u201c Quite a few China specialists are concerned about it , \u201d he told Vox .\n\u201c They see the incidents of anti-Asian attacks and that sort of thing in the US as being stimulated or triggered by certain things being said by US officials.\n\u201d Beyond being potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric is just unnecessary .\nAs Vox \u2019 s Jerusalem Demsas has previously reported , such framing isn \u2019 t needed to garner public support for policies like the Innovation and Competition Act .\nAs Demsas noted , portraying the legislation as investments to compete with China did little to change how much the public ultimately backed it in a survey fielded by Data for Progress earlier this year .\nConflict or competition with Asian countries has historically fueled xenophobia Historically , there have been numerous instances of either conflict or competition with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US .\nIn 1982 , as manufacturing competition with Japan ramped up , two Detroit autoworkers beat and killed 27-year-old draftsman Vincent Chin , a Chinese American man , accusing him of taking their jobs .\nDuring the Korean War , when China aligned itself with North Korea , vandals went after businesses near Chinatowns across the US .\nDuring World War II , in the wake of Japan \u2019 s attack on Pearl Harbor , Japanese Americans were put into internment camps by the US government .\nAnd following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans were among those targeted for the way they looked .\nMost recently , during the pandemic , there \u2019 s been a sharp uptick of reported anti-Asian incidents tied to rhetoric used by President Trump and other Republicans who deployed phrases like \u201c China virus , \u201d and \u201c Kung Flu , \u201d which effectively scapegoated Asian Americans for the spread of the coronavirus .\n\u201c When officials express fears over China or other Asian countries , Americans immediately turn to a timeworn racial script that questions the loyalty , allegiance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d University of Maryland political science professor Janelle Wong and writer Viet Thanh Nguyen previously argued in a Washington Post op-ed .\n\u201c Most Americans are not skilled at distinguishing between people of different Asian origins or ancestries , and the result is that whenever China is attacked , so are Asian Americans as a whole.\n\u201d This conflation is a direct result of the belief that Asian Americans are perpetual foreigners , and feeds off tropes that treat all Asian people as homogenous .\n\u201c We become collateral damage every time there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ong .\nConcerns about such profiling have emerged following accusations faced by Chinese American scientists in recent decades as STEM competition between the two countries has grown .\nIn 1999 , Chinese American scientist Wen Ho Lee was arrested by the US government , only to be released once he pleaded guilty to mishandling data , and it became clear there was not sufficient evidence to support other allegations .\nIn 2014 , hydrologist Sherry Chen was apprehended for similar reasons and also saw the charges subsequently dropped .\nIt \u2019 s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual citizens , but the US government itself that still makes negative assumptions about many people of Asian descent .\n\u201c Our country \u2026 has a long and sordid history of discrimination against Chinese Americans , of targeting Chinese Americans , and this dates back to the late 19th century , when there were multiple massacres of Chinese Americans and multiple discriminatory anti-immigration laws passed that targeted the Chinese community , \u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin ( D-MD ) said at a recent roundtable reviewing the pattern of anti-Asian discrimination .\n\u201c The legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the latest chapter is unfortunately in the alleged targeting and scrutiny of Chinese American scientists.\n\u201d Lawmakers \u2014 and many other Americans \u2014 should reframe how they talk about China As both recent and more distant history has made evident , the ways that lawmakers talk about China has huge effects .\nBroadly labeling China an enemy can lead to needless marginalization , violence , and even death .\n\u201c I think the biggest advice is to not have anything that was sweeping .\nWe \u2019 re asking folks to watch their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their approach to China , \u201d said chief of staff for the Foreign Policy for America \u2019 s NextGen initiative Caroline Chang .\nStaying away from broad terms and talking about the government or specific leaders , such as President Xi Jinping , is a start .\nThe CAPAC promotes this idea of precision in its guidelines .\nCAPAC has published guidance for other lawmakers regarding rhetoric .\nA source familiar with Schumer \u2019 s office said staffers have been careful about the rhetoric used around this bill and have been focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news releases and speeches .\nThe office has also been working to encourage reporters and media not to call the legislation the \u201c China bill.\n\u201d Some activists and progressive lawmakers , including Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) , have also noted that the larger framing of America \u2019 s relationship as part of a zero-sum competition with China creates a stark and troubling binary that doesn \u2019 t reflect the cooperation that \u2019 s currently needed to address climate change and other pressing global problems .\n\u201c If the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this dangerous bipartisan push for a new Cold War with China risks empowering hardliners in both countries , fueling more violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities , and failing to confront the truly existential shared threats we face this century , \u201d a group of activists wrote in a letter this past spring .\nWhether lawmakers adopt CAPAC \u2019 s recommendations \u2014 and change their approach to describing competition with the Chinese government \u2014 remains to be seen , but confronting this problem as these bills make their way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that US leaders aren \u2019 t continuing to feed xenophobia .\n\u201c I continue to be nervous because it \u2019 s going to continue to be a challenge for the US , and we as a country need to figure out a way to talk about China , \u201d Chang said

United States as its biggest export market , with Hong Kong and Japan in second and third place .\nJapan and the US also accounted for Taiwan \u2019 s largest import partners .\nTwenty years later , the numbers tell a different tale .\nChina by far is now Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , and counting it together with a much more integrated Hong Kong , its trade nearly dwarfs all other trade Taiwan has with the entire West .\nIf money is power , the flow of trade between Taiwan and the mainland represents an increasing amount of power to shake Washington \u2019 s grip on the island territory .\nIn this context , headlines like , \u201c US government clears $ 750 million artillery sale to Taiwan , \u201d from Defense News look less like Washington making headway and more like a futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch-up.\n\u201d It is catching up in the only way the US appears able to , through a series of manufactured threats and the promise of protection through arms sales to defend against them .\nThe defense capabilities offered to Taiwan through this most recent deal would make little difference \u201c if \u201d a war ever broke out between the Chinese mainland and its Taiwan territory .\nBut that \u2019 s only \u201c if.\n\u201d In reality , the economic integration of Taiwan with the mainland is long underway and Washington \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firefighter , can only delay this inevitability .\nThe US State Department has cleared the sale of self-propelled howitzers and GPS-guided kits for artillery shells to Taiwan , marking the first such approval for the country \u2019 s self-ruling by the Biden administration .\nThe Defense Security and Cooperation Agency , or DSCA , announced the approval on Wednesday afternoon for Taiwan to acquire 40 M-109A6 Paladin 155mm self-propelled howitzers with associated equipment and support .\nThe estimated cost of the potential sale is $ 750 million .\nLarge expenditures on \u201c defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner is obviously illogical and wasteful .\nIt is the sort of policy one could expect Taiwan \u2019 s politicians to pursue in support of US foreign policy objectives , rather than in support of Taiwan \u2019 s actual own best interests .\nThe arms deal has only created pressure between both Washington and Beijing , and the Chinese mainland with its Taiwan territory .\nEven the US Doesn \u2019 t Recognize Taiwan as

China .\nLittle to no regard at all is given to what is actually best for Taiwan .\nThis is why US policy toward Taiwan continues to focus on undermining positive communication between Taiwan and its

the opposition .\nThe same process is happening in Taipei regarding pro-independence politicians .\nThe island is much larger than Hong Kong , possessing many of its own institutions including a

, small-scale agriculture , and infrastructure development .\nNow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 military coup , it appears that deforestation is ramping up in Tanintharyi , echoing wider patterns across Myanmar .\nNew satellite data from the University of Maryland , visualized on Global Forest Watch ( GFW ) , show a wave of forest loss in northern Dawei district , where a large portion of the land is designated as Tanintharyi Nature Reserve .\nAccording to a 2020 study published in The European Journal of Development Research , most of the remaining intact natural forest in Dawei district is within the nature reserve .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the second-highest level of primary forest loss within the reserve since measurements began in 2002 .\nOver those 18 years , 60 square kilometers ( 23 square miles ) of forest was leveled , representing a loss of 4.5 % of its primary forest cover .\nWhile preliminary data for 2021 indicate deforestation in the reserve is down overall so far this year , forest loss is still expanding along existing fronts as well as in areas that were previously undisturbed .\nSatellite data show expanding areas of tree cover loss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2021 .\nMost of the recent deforestation is taking place just inside the southern boundary of the reserve , where forest loss patterns are consistent with the expansion of clearings that were burned during

often unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tanintharyi .\nConcessions may not even be intended to grow crops at all , according to researchers and activists who say that companies are clearing forest under

and civil society organizations say they fear violence and arrests over their environmental activism .\nAs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation programs have shut down , said Esther Wah , an Indigenous Karen activist whose fight for customary land rights predates the current regime .\nThe situation threatens to undo much of the progress made in land rights and environmental conservation over the past

amid rising security risks to its in-country nationals , interests and investments .\nIn a surprise and still unexplained move , Prime Minister Imran Khan announced last week that businessman Khalid Mansoor would be the nation \u2019 s new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) infrastructure-building program .\nThe announcement said Lieutenant General Asim Saleem Bajwa will step down as head of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority ( CPECA ) , ending the military \u2019 s de facto two-year control over a scheme that has been riddled with delays and wobbled by militant attacks .\nKhan \u2019 s statement came soon after the July 16 bomb attack on a bus that killed nine Chinese nationals including engineers working on a CPEC-related hydropower dam project .\nPakistani officials have since indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , a Uighur militant group bent on targeting Chinese interests both in Xinjiang and abroad , and other militant groups .\nThe lethal attack came at an especially delicate , if not strategic , juncture as China tries to lobby Afghanistan \u2019 s Taliban into clamping down on its aligned militant and terror groups in quid pro quo exchange for infrastructure investments that would link the country with the CPEC and further afield into Central Asia if and when , as widely anticipated , the militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s not immediately clear if Bajwa \u2019 s removal as the CPECA \u2019 s chairperson only halfway through his four-year appointment was directly related to the security lapse .\nPrime Minister \u2019 s Khan announcement fell short of stating any specific reason for his removal , though the military \u2019 s outsized role in steering the scheme was aimed in large part to guarantee project security in a region riddled with militants .\nSignificantly , too , the announcement did not name a replacement for the CPECA \u2019 s top post .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has worked in top positions with a CPEC-related China-Pakistan coal-mining syndicate in Sindh province and who has a history of liaising with Chinese companies and financial institutions , was named as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on CPEC affairs .\nThe role has no mandatory power under Pakistan \u2019 s constitution and may not attend government cabinet meetings without special invitations .\nSignificantly , Mansoor was not and will not clearly in future be appointed as the CPECA \u2019 s chairman , a statutory position under the CPEC Authority Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s removal could have been influenced by recent scandals .\nIn August 2020 , journalist Ahmed Noorani published an investigative story online claiming that Bajwa had abused his military authority to establish various offshore businesses in the name of his wife , sons and brothers \u2013 alleged sprawling commercial interests that became known as his \u201c pizza empire \u201d in recognition of his investments in the US .\nA few weeks after the bombshell story was published , Bajwa rubbished the allegations and claimed to possess all the relevant documents about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests were all above board .\nBut opposition parties remained adamant in their calls for a judicial inquiry into his family \u2019 s offshore assets and his resignation as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting , which he finally did in October 2020 .\nHowever , Bajwa retained his position as CPECA chairperson despite unanswered questions about his personal wealth , which some suspect was derived in part from the CPEC .\nNow , some observers believe Bajwa was likely removed at Beijing \u2019 s behest .\nThey note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow execution of CPEC projects in recent months .\nThe bus attack , they suggest , was likely the straw that broke the camel \u2019 s back , as the top brass general couldn \u2019 t even guarantee the security of CPEC projects from rising militant attacks .\nSignificantly , Bajwa \u2019 s removal came just days after Pakistan \u2019 s Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Inter-Service Intelligence ( ISI ) chief Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed flew to Beijing to reassure their Chinese hosts that the military would provide full security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , there is widespread speculation on social media that Khan \u2019 s decision not to immediately appoint a new CPECA head is a signal that Beijing intends to take more control over CPEC projects and related personnel decisions .\nThey believe Mansoor \u2019 s appointment as special assistant to the premier was likely requested by Beijing .\nEither way , the CPEC \u2019 s power dynamics are discernably shifting .\nLast year \u2019 s promulgation of the CPEC Authority Act ( 2020 ) , aimed to expedite the scheme \u2019 s many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPECA near-absolute power to plan , facilitate , coordinate , enforce , monitor and evaluate CPEC-related activities .\nThat gave Bajwa unrivaled authority over the multi-billion dollar scheme , allowing him to sideline parliament and the planning ministry in the process .\nAhsan Iqbal , a former federal minister for planning and secretary-general of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) party , told Asia Times that he had earlier taken strong exception to the formation of the CPECA and its carte blanche authority during a Standing Committee on Planning , Development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technopolitical person with the full backing of the parliament to efficiently run CPEC affairs .\nDuring my tenure as planning minister , more than $ 29 billion investment was channelized by the planning ministry without any authority or a superfluous overhead structure .\nThe same model , which worked successfully in the past , should have continued , \u201d Ahsan said .\nHe claims that Khan \u2019 s government undermined the momentum and initiative of line ministries by imposing an unnecessary command structure that ultimately complicated the CPEC \u2019 s implementation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ snail \u2019 s pace due to the Covid-19 pandemic , administrative red tape and a deteriorating security situation , witnessed most recently in last month \u2019 s bomb attack .\nThe CPEC has also been slowed by Islambad \u2019 s now twice-made request to Beijing for debt relief on loans and take-or-pay contracts coming due .\nTo date , China has declined to engage in any debt rescheduling discussions , according to local sources familiar with the situation .\nThe CPEC \u2019 s official website shows that over a dozen energy , communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion deadlines .\nFive CPEC power projects with a cumulative generation capacity of 3,600 megawatts have not started commercial operation

issuing statements in social and mainstream media to wrongfully influence the public against the use of Ivermectin despite the existence of large amounts of clinical data showing its profound effectiveness in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 .\nIn particular , the Indian Bar brief referenced the peer-reviewed publications and evidence compiled by the ten-member Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance ( FLCCC ) group and the 65-member British Ivermectin Recommendation Development ( BIRD ) panel headed by WHO consultant and meta-analysis expert Dr. Tess Lawrie .\nThe brief cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital cases in New York where court orders were required for dying COVID patients to receive the Ivermectin .\nIn multiple instances of such comatose patients , following the court-ordered Ivermectin , the patients recovered .\nIn addition , the Indian Bar Association cited previous articles published in this forum , The Desert Review .\nAdvocate Ojha accused the WHO and

robust oversight of the nuclear industry .\nIn Japan , the failure of the major national news media to scrutinize the industry and hold it accountable was particularly glaring .\nDespite their own claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major media have instead covered Japan \u2019 s powerful nuclear industry with a mix of silent complicity and outright boosterism .\nThis is true both before and after the Fukushima disaster .\nIn the decades after World War II , when the nuclear industry was established , media played an active role in overcoming public resistance to atomic energy and winning at least passive acceptance of it as a science-based means for Japan to secure energy autonomy .\nDuring the Fukushima disaster , the media served government objectives such as preservation of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident and severity of radiological releases , resulting in widely divergent coverage from serious overseas media .\nWhile a short-lived proliferation of more critical and independent coverage followed the disaster , the old patterns returned with a vengeance after the installment of the pro-nuclear administration of Abe Shinz\u014d .\nThis article will examine the roots of the Japanese media \u2019 s failure to challenge or scrutinize the nuclear industry , and how this complicity has played out in the post-Fukushima era .\nIt will use a historical analysis to look at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually established in the immediate postwar period , and the formation of public support for civilian nuclear power .\nDuring my 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Tokyo , including a six-year stint as Tokyo bureau chief of The New York Times ( 2009-2015 ) , I often covered the same news events as Japanese journalists , standing shoulder-to-shoulder at more press conferences than we \u2019 d care to count .\nWhile I admire many Japanese colleagues individually as journalists , I was frequently struck by the shortcomings of Japan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution .\nBut never did I feel these structural weaknesses as keenly as I did in the tense weeks that followed the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station .\nIn Minami-soma , a city 25 kilometers north of the stricken plant , where some 20,000 remaining residents were cut off from supplies of food , fuel and medicines , I discovered that journalists from major Japanese media were nowhere to be seen .\nThey had withdrawn from Minami-soma , forbidden by their editors in Tokyo from approaching within 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By doing so , they had essentially abandoned the already isolated residents .\nBut you would never know that from the media \u2019 s stories , which made no mention of their own pull out or the perceived risks that had prompted this retreat .\nInstead , the main newspaper articles uniformly repeated official reassurances that there was no cause for alarm because the radiation posed \u201c no immediate danger to human health , \u201d as the chief cabinet secretary at the time , Edano Yukio , so famously put it.1 The mismatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were telling their audiences and what they were actually doing to protect their own journalists\u2014was glaring .\nIt turned out that this was only the first of several instances during the Fukushima disaster where I witnessed Japan \u2019 s major media adhering to the official narrative regardless of the facts on the ground .\nI refer to this phenomenon as \u201c media capture , \u201d borrowing from the more widely used term \u201c regulatory capture , \u201d which is used to describe a similar failure of government oversight of the nuclear industry .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meltdowns , I saw numerous instances of national media refusing to take a critical or distanced stance in their coverage of the nuclear industry and its government regulators .\nInstead , they repeatedly chose to internalize the official narratives and even adhere to the government-approved language .\nWe saw this is the widely diverging narratives that started appearing in the serious foreign press versus the major domestic media as the accident worsened .\nTo cite a straightforward example , we started using the word \u201c meltdown \u201d within hours of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting the almost unanimous view of outside experts that a melting fuel core was the only realistic source of the hydrogen that caused the blast .\nHowever , the domestic national dailies and NHK avoided the word \u201c meltdown \u201d ( in Japanese , merutodaun ) for months , following the insistence of the Ministry of Economics , Trade and Industry ( METI ) , the powerful government agency that both promoted and regulated Japan \u2019 s nuclear industry , that a meltdown had not been confirmed .\nThe big Japanese media used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c explosion-like event \u201d to describe the massive blast at the Unit 3 reactor building , which blew chunks of concrete hundreds of feet into the air .\nIn fact , I even had Japanese journalists calling me to berate me and my newspaper for using the M-word without METI \u2019 s permission .\nReaders of the Japanese national dailies didn \u2019 t see the M-word until mid-May , when METI and the plant \u2019 s operator , Tokyo Electric Power Co. or TEPCO , conceded in public that Fukushima Daiichi had indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact .\nIn the chapter that I wrote for Legacies of Fukushima : 3.11 in Context , I tried to explain some of the reasons why the civilian nuclear power industry could have such a peculiarly strong grip on the media and their narratives .\nThe nuclear industry was a national project that was promoted by the powerful central ministries as a silver bullet for resource-poor Japan \u2019 s dependence on imported energy .\nThis gave it an elevated status as the elite bureaucrats guided Japan \u2019 s postwar recovery and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s dependence on Tokyo \u2019 s powerful central ministries , which takes its most visible form in the so-called kisha kurabu , or \u201c press clubs.\n\u201d These are arrangements that allow national media to station their journalists inside the ministries and agencies , where they are given their own room and exclusive access to officials .\nMuch of the reporting by the major Japanese media starts in the kisha kurabu , where journalists gather to wait for the next press conference or off-record briefing from officials .\nThe kisha kurabu system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which reporters become dependent on the ministry within which they are embedded .\nIn pursuit of a scoop that can make or break a career , the journalists compete for handouts from ministry officials .\nAll too often , they enter a Faustian bargain in which the journalists swap narrative control in exchange for exclusive access to information .\nThe result is a passive form of access journalism that ends up repeating spoon-fed official narratives .\nI also looked to the past at the emergence of newspapers like the Asahi Shimbun during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national priority was to protect autonomy by finding a way to catch the industrialized West .\nI argued that this history baked into the mindset of Japanese journalists a feeling of responsibility for the fate of their nation , including its vital energy needs .\nIt also led to an identification with the government , and particularly the elite officialdom , as protectors of Japan and its people from predatory foreign powers .\nThis inclination to side with the state has continued in the postwar period , when journalists have clearly seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to a broader bureaucratic-led system .\nOne point that I wanted to underscore was that this media capture was not something so simple or venal as corruption .\nThis is how it is often portrayed by critical Japanese writers , usually freelancers and book authors , who focus on the so-called Nuclear Village , a nexus of business , government , labor unions , academia and news media linked by the cash flowing out of the highly profitable nuclear plants .\nWhile money doubtlessly plays a role in many of these relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasters , I see no direct evidence that it sways the coverage of the national newspapers .\nThese are privately held companies for whom advertising is a much less important revenue source than subscriptions ( or the rent from their valuable real estate holdings in central Tokyo and Osaka ) .\nRegardless of the cause , the result has been generations of postwar journalists who have consistently failed to serve as watchdogs on one of the nation \u2019 s most politically powerful industries.2 Starting in the 1990s , public scandals started plaguing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2002 , government inspectors announced that TEPCO had been routinely falsifying safety reports to hide minor incidents and equipment problems at reactors including several at Fukushima Daiichi .\nTEPCO eventually admitted to more than 200 such violations stretching back to 1977 .\nFive years later , TEPCO revealed even more cover-ups of safety issues , which the company had failed to report in the previous inquiry .\nDespite what was clearly a chronic and systemic failure of both internal compliance and government oversight , no one was arrested or charged , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The media could have played a role of holding the regulators \u2019 feet to the fire by exposing the structural problems behind this abysmal record of obfuscation and cover-ups .\nInstead , the watchdogs chose to remain largely silent , reporting on the government \u2019 s revelations , but making few efforts at independent investigative reporting .\nOf course , such criticisms enjoy the benefits of hindsight , with the accident in 2011 making it easier to see these failures as part of a broader narrative that leads inevitably to Fukushima .\nBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity of the disaster led to numerous calls for reform ?\nDuring that time , the national media have also been held up to uncomfortable scrutiny by a jaded and distrustful public , who felt betrayed by their early coverage of the accident .\nUnfortunately , ten years later , nothing seems to have changed .\nThis was apparent in mid-April of 2021 , when the Japanese government announced a decision to release into the Pacific Ocean more than 1.2 million tons of radioactive water that has been building up in hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fukushima Daiichi plant .\n( The accumulation of contaminated water has plagued the plant from the early days of the disaster .\nTEPCO has resorted to some high-tech solutions with mixed results , including a mile-long \u201c ice wall \u201d of frozen dirt that failed to fully block the water , much of which flows into the plant from underground . )\nThe water stored in these tanks contains tritium , a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that is best known for its military use as the fuel for thermonuclear warheads ( hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nOn the spectrum of radioactive substances , tritium emits relatively low levels of radiation in form of beta particles .\nBut it is a radioactive substance nonetheless , a fact that major media played down or even omitted by choosing , once again , to adopt the industry and government \u2019 s language to describe the dump .\nThe main news stories in the major national newspapers and TV broadcasts used the official term for this water , which is shorisui , or \u201c treated water.\n\u201d While technically correct , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the same as , say , treated sewage water .\nNor does treated water convey the fact that this water still contains a radionuclide that emits beta radiation .\nOne result was an interesting battle of words that pitted the mainstream media , which used the approved \u201c treated water , \u201d against journalists who were outside the press club \u2019 s inner circle .\nThese publications and web sites chose to use clearer terms such as osensui , or \u201c contaminated water.\n\u201d The leftist daily Tokyo Shimbun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for its more critical coverage of the nuclear disaster , compromised by calling the water osenshorisui , or \u201c contaminated treated water.\n\u201d 3 More eye-opening was the fact that there were actually efforts to enforce use of the officially approved term .\nAs many journalists discovered , there was an army of social media trolls at ready to pile onto anyone with the temerity to use more critical terminology , and particularly \u201c contaminated water.\n\u201d TEPCO and the government mobilized university experts and PR professionals to police the public sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c unscientific \u201d and \u201c ideological.\n\u201d Of course , the choice of the word \u201c treated \u201d is itself also highly political .\nIt buttressed the larger message put forth by the government and the plant \u2019 s operator that the release of this water was no cause for alarm , but something very common and normal that nuclear plants around the world do all the time .\nBy accepting the official terminology , the media were implicitly adopting this framing of the issue , which focused on the claim that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being harmless when dumped into the Pacific .\nScientifically , this is a valid claim .\nMy point here is not to take sides .\nRather , I am criticizing the large domestic media for failing to do the same : i.e.\n, not take sides .\nBy adopting the official narrative , the media were complicit in the government \u2019 s and TEPCO \u2019 s exclusion of other , also valid counterarguments .\nOne of the biggest is the fact that this release is anything but normal .\nNo nuclear plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a huge quantity of tritium-laden water .\n( At the time of writing , the amount , 1.2 million tons , is enough to fill almost 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools . )\nWorse , the release is to be carried out in the same closed , opaque manner as the rest of Japan \u2019 s decade-long response to the disaster .\nUnless TEPCO and METI break with past precedent to allow full international oversight to verify that the water is as clean as they claim it is , we are left once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violated public faith .\nJust as importantly , there are valid reasons to at least question whether the water is as clean as TEPCO says it is .\nThe company has been telling us for years that it has installed state-of-the-art treatment and filtration technologies that scrub the water of every radioactive particle except tritium .\nHowever , in 2018 , the plant operator suddenly revealed that 75 % of the treated water at the plant still contained excessive amounts of other , more radioactive substances including strontium 90 , a dangerous isotope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue of human bones.4 To be fair , TEPCO may be right in its assessment of the water \u2019 s safety .\nEven so , it is the job of conscientious journalists to take a skeptical attitude toward such claims until they can be independently verified .\nThe media also need to remind why this is necessary , given the company \u2019 s and the industry \u2019 s history of cover-ups .\nMy goal here is to fault the major domestic media for once again failing to do this , despite the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of METI and TEPCO privileges the official perspective over others .\nIt shows that the journalists are internalizing the official framing of the event and how it should be discussed and understood .\nOfficialdom is thus allowed to set the boundaries of public debate , excluding more critical perspectives as \u201c political , \u201d \u201c unscientific \u201d or even \u201c foreign.\n\u201d The last characterization reflects the fact that the Chinese and South Korean governments raised some of the loudest objections to the release .\nThe media have tended to frame these as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints by Asian rivals that like to accuse Japan of failing to apologize for World War II-era atrocities .\nWhile Beijing and Seoul may have political motives for seizing on the water issue , this shouldn \u2019 t be a reason for journalists to avoid taking up more substantive criticisms about the release .\nOpposition has appeared in many other countries and reflects the failure of Japan to consult with other nations that share the Pacific Ocean , which will be the site of the mass water dump .\nThis is a failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform their readers of the existence of alternative narratives that take a dimmer view of the actions taken by Japan \u2019 s officialdom , or that point out where government interests diverge from those of Japan \u2019 s public .\nThis is also a failure of a different sort : of media to protect their own intellectual independence .\nBy uncritically adopting the official narratives , the journalists are relinquishing the right to frame in their issues .\nThis surrendering of agency is the central fact of the media capture that I described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unique in suffering from the problem of media capture .\nThe press in other democratic countries face similar challenges .\nIn the United States , we use the term \u201c access journalism \u201d to describe the pitfalls of journalists , often in Washington , who trade autonomy for exclusive access to official sources .\nHowever , Japan \u2019 s version of access journalism is more extreme , producing a uniformly monolithic coverage closer to that in non-democratic societies .\nThe most apt American equivalent may be the period of extreme patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrorist attacks and the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , when U.S. media failed to adequately challenge the erroneous claims of the Bush administration that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction .\nIn Japan \u2019 s ongoing Fukushima disaster , this lack of agency manifests itself as a failure to not only set the narrative , but even to decide what is newsworthy .\nMost of the coverage is essentially an act of regurgitating the information that was distributed at the ministry \u2019 s kisha kurabu .\nSince the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ministry officials , not surprisingly they usually showcase the actions of those officials .\nBoth the pages of Japan \u2019 s national dailies and the evening news broadcasts of NHK are filled with stories of Japanese officialdom in action , solving some problem or punishing some wrongdoer .\nMost news reports are mini-dramas in which officials play the starring role .\nAs such , they serve as demonstrations that agency lies in the elite bureaucracies at the center of the postwar Japanese state , and not the major media , which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when critical stories appear , they are rarely the work of enterprising reporters unearthing facts that the powerful would rather keep covered .\nRather , the revelations tend to come from official actors when they have decided to take action against malfeasance .\nOne example was TEPCO \u2019 s cover-ups , mentioned earlier , which were exposed by nuclear regulators , not investigative reporters .\nA more recent example is revelations that started to become public in March 2021 of years of security lapses at the huge Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next two months , news stories dribbled out about workers who were able to access the sensitive areas around the plant \u2019 s nuclear reactors without proper ID .\nIn one case in 2015 , a man entered the reactor area using the ID of his father , who also worked at the plant .\nOnce again , there lapses were not exposed by intrepid reporters but regulators themselves , who leaked them to prepare the public for their decision to reject TEPCO \u2019 s request to restart the plant.5 The lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring because there have been very notable exceptions .\nJapan \u2019 s journalists have shown that they are capable of true investigative reporting that can define and drive the public narrative .\nFor a brief window of time during the early years of the Fukushima disaster , some major Japanese media experimented with more autonomous journalism .\nThis began in the late summer of 2011 , as public disillusionment in the domestic press \u2019 s compliant coverage grew .\nThis prompted some media to try to re-engage readers with more hard-hitting reports that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable of these efforts was launched by the Asahi Shimbun , Japan \u2019 s second-largest daily , which beefed up a new reporting group dedicated to investigative journalism .\n( By investigative journalism , I mean journalists taking the initiative to pry out hidden truths and assemble these into original , factual narratives that challenge the versions of reality put forth by the powerful . )\nThe Asahi \u2019 s investigative division got off to a strong start by winning Japan \u2019 s most prestigious press award two years in a row .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest coup in May 2014 , when two of its reporters wrote a front-page story that exposed the dangerously poor crisis management at the plant as it teetered on the brink of catastrophe .\nThe story revealed that the government had hidden testimony by the Fukushima Daiichi plant \u2019 s manager during the accident , Yoshida Masao , who later died of cancer .\nIt also recounted what it said was the most explosive revelation of this secret testimony : that hundreds of workers and staff had fled the crippled plant at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that Yoshida never gave them the order to leave .\nHowever , the Asahi erred by giving the story a misleading headline , which left readers with the impression that the workers had fled in defiance of Yoshida \u2019 s order to stay .\n( In fact , Yoshida himself says in the testimony that his order didn \u2019 t reach these workers\u2014a stunning breakdown in command and control that was lost in the subsequent blow up over the article . )\nThis misstep gave critics the opening that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and by extension the newspaper \u2019 s proactive coverage of the disaster .\nA host of critics , including the prime minister himself and the rest of the mainstream media , set upon the Asahi with unusual ferocity .\nAfter weeks of withering attacks , which essentially accused the newspaper of lacking patriotism and of belittling the heroic plant workers , the Asahi \u2019 s president made a dramatic surrender in September 2014 , retracting the entire article , gutting the investigative team and resigning his own job to take responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Asahi \u2019 s short-lived foray into investigative journalism , which I have described in more detail in this journal.7 Suffice it to say here that when forced to make a choice , the Asahi , the nation \u2019 s leading liberal voice favored by the intelligentsia , chose to remain on the boat .\nTo preserve the privileged insider status as a member of the kisha kurabu media , the newspaper chose to sacrifice not only its biggest reporting accomplishment of the disaster , but also the journalists who produced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile .\nFor years afterward , the newspaper shunned proactive reporting on Fukushima , staying within safe confines of the official storyline .\nThe Asahi \u2019 s biggest mistake was its failure to stand behind its journalists .\nInvestigative reporting is by nature a highly risky undertaking , and one that pits a handful of underpaid journalists against some of the most powerful members of society .\nBy not only failing to stand up for its investigative reporters but trying to scapegoat them by punishing them for the mistakes in coverage , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream journalists : Newspapers don \u2019 t have your back .\nIn such an environment , what journalists in their right mind would want to challenge the powers that be ?\nAdmirably , some of the Asahi \u2019 s investigative reporters did stand their ground even at the cost of their careers at the newspaper .\nSoon after the debacle , two of the investigative group \u2019 s top reporters quit to launch Japan \u2019 s first NGO dedicated to investigative journalism , which in 2021 was renamed Tokyo Investigative Newsroom Tansa.8 Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine dedicated to investigative coverage ( and offering stories that can not be found in the large national newspapers ) .\nThese decisions to place principle over company and career underscore my broader point : The sources of Japan \u2019 s media capture are bigger than the individual reporters and embedded in the structure of media institutions and the practice in Japan of journalism itself .\nThe Asahi \u2019 s capitulation in 2014 marked the end of not just the Asahi \u2019 s but all the mainstream media \u2019 s efforts to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fukushima disaster .\nThese days , most reporting tends to fall into one of a few prepackaged , safely uncontroversial storylines .\nThere is the Fukushima 50 narrative of successfully overcoming Japan \u2019 s biggest trial since World War II .\nAnother is the \u201c baseless rumors \u201d ( fuhy\u014d higai ) narrative , which casts fears of radiation as over-exaggerated , and usually the creation of women , leftists and foreigners .\nJournalists have told me that the Asahi \u2019 s surrender created a powerful prohibition on critical coverage .\nHaving seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal newspaper , and the star reporters there who lost their careers , few journalists have the stomach to challenge the status quo .\nThe result is a grim new conformity .\nAdding to the pressure to toe the line has been the appearance post-Fukushima of another new , problem-plagued national project : the Tokyo Summer Olympics , originally scheduled for 2020 .\nCoverage of the Olympics has again tended to adhere to official narratives , even as public misgivings grew in Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide \u2019 s decision to go forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2021 , in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic .\nFrom the start , the government has used the Olympics to divert attention from Fukushima while proclaiming that the disaster is now in the past .\nWhile there has been critical coverage , it has been the exception and not the rule .\nIndeed , the media \u2019 s silence was deafening when the previous prime minister , Abe Shinz\u014d , told the International Olympic Committee in Buenos Aires in September 2013 that the plant \u2019 s \u201c situation was under control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bleeding into the Pacific .\nBy failing to take the initiative in Fukushima , the media have ended up supporting official efforts to use the Games to put the lid back on the nuclear disaster .\nThe Olympics have become yet one more means for Japan \u2019 s elites to regain control of the public sphere , or at least the part of it controlled by the big legacy media .\n( They have had less success asserting control over the much more anarchic and anonymous world of social media . )\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has also been apparent during the Covid-19 pandemic .\nI \u2019 m still waiting for the investigative articles that expose the truth behind Tokyo \u2019 s biggest failures during the pandemic .\nThe major media emitted barely a peep in response to the government \u2019 s blatantly discriminatory decision during the first six months of the pandemic to close Japan \u2019 s borders to all foreign nationals , including long-term residents , while allowing Japanese nationals to come and go .\nMore importantly , I would be the first in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed the roll out of vaccines in Japan .\nAll too often , coverage of COVID-19 ended up repeating the pattern that we saw in Fukushima .\nThe media once again surrendered their biggest public asset : their power to challenge the official narrative and expose the facts that officials don \u2019 t want us to know .\nInstead , the major domestic media once again show themselves more interested in preserving their privileged insider status .\nBy doing so , they once again do a disservice of their readers .\nThe need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent and critical voice should have been the media \u2019 s biggest takeaway from Fukushima .\nInstead , they appear to be merely repeating the mistakes of a

get the impression that Australia is really dealing with an existential crisis .\nWhile that may be true with regards to obesity , drug abuse and homelessness , it seems to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAfter all , while evidence of the above mentioned scourges is visible everywhere in the country , the only place the coronavirus seems to exist in Australia is on the nightly news channels ( which , by the way , have done a very poor job of keeping their audiences up to date on latest developments .\nSources in New Zealand , for example , have informed that the media there has largely ignored the story of anti-lockdown protests happening just across the Tasman Sea ) .\nFor example , New South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to portray the pandemic as enemy number one , expressed from the boob tube her \u201c deepest , deepest sympathies \u201d to the families of three people who died overnight from/with the coronavirus .\nWho were these fatalities ?\nThe public was not informed of their identities , but Berejiklian described them as \u201c a man in his 80s , and a man in his 90s , and a female in her 90s.\n\u201d It \u2019 s just a hunch , but could the comorbidity in each of those \u201c tragic

prevention ?\nThat would certainly be the height of irony if true considering that the effort is killing just about everyone .\nIn fact , it seems that the real pandemic attacking the Australian people is government-sponsored fear .\nMeanwhile , Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews added insult to injury when he commanded from his bully pulpit that citizens , now deprived of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jobless hours , were forbidden from removing their masks to drink alcohol in the great outdoors .\nAs to whether the consumption of a non-alcoholic beverage outdoors would also fall within the tight confines of the mask regime , dear leader did not say .\nHowever , the answer seems pretty clear since the state is actually using police helicopters to shoo away sunbathers from the nation \u2019 s

approaches used by both global powers regarding foreign policy .\nAnother recent example on stark display is the US and China \u2019 s respective approaches to Vietnam \u2013 a nation both countries have had rocky and even hostile relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waged armed conflict on Vietnam last century .\nThe nearly 20 year-long US war with Vietnam was decidedly much more catastrophic than the month-long failed invasion launched by China .\nThe US only normalized its relations with Vietnam in 1997 , China having done so a few years earlier in 1991 .\nSince then Vietnam \u2019 s main benefits from both nations have been economic .\nIn 1997 , according to Harvard University \u2019 s Atlas of Economic Complexity , Japan stood as Vietnam \u2019 s largest export market accounting for 24.22 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US and China accounting for 4.15 % and 4.48 % respectively ( Hong Kong accounting for an additional 3.23 % in China \u2019 s favor ) .\nAlso in 1997 , 9.5 % of Vietnam \u2019 s imports came from China versus 2.45 % from the United States .\nIn 2019 , the numbers told a very different story .\nChina is now Vietnam \u2019 s largest export market standing at 21.45 % versus the United States at 19.26 % .\nChina is also Vietnam \u2019 s largest source of imports at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % .\nBetween 1997 and 2019 Europe has slipped from Vietnam \u2019 s second largest regional export market to third , behind Asia and North America ( primarily the US ) .\nTrade with China is vastly important to Vietnam \u2019 s economy .\nAccess to additional markets is also a priority for Vietnam .\nConsidering this very important fact , what is it that Beijing and Washington bring to the table to address this primary concern and how will this play out in the near and long-term regarding current US-China tensions ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table During Her Recent Visit to Vietnam ?\nAP News in its August 2021 article , \u201c Harris urges Vietnam to join US in opposing China \u2018 bullying , \u2019 \u201d lays out the bleak proposition offered to Hanoi by Washington \u2013 to join the US in a growing conflict against Vietnam \u2019 s largest trading partner .\n\u201c We need to find ways to pressure and raise the pressure , frankly , on Beijing to abide by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , and to challenge its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said in remarks at the opening of a meeting with Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc .\nObviously , by joining the US in \u201c pressuring \u201d China regarding the South China Sea , Vietnam would endanger its diplomatic and economic ties with China .\nIt could also potentially trigger a security crisis with China \u2013 a nation it shares a 1,297 km long border with .\nIt should be noted that despite Washington \u2019 s oversimplification and exaggeration of the South China Sea situation , the reality is much more complicated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global stability .\nDisputes are between not only Southeast Asian nations and China , but also among Southeast Asian states themselves .\nFor example Vietnam , the Philippines , and Malaysia all have overlapping claims within the South China Sea with each other in addition to with China , resulting in minor incidents that are often resolved quickly and bilaterally .\nThe US has deliberately injected itself into these disputes in an attempt to transform them into a regional or even international crisis it can leverage against China .\nIn essence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imaginary and absolutely needless conflict that would ensnare Hanoi in a security alliance with the US at the expense of constructive ties with China .\nIt would also risk destabilizing the region in which Vietnam resides \u2013 endangering political and economic stability required for its peace and prosperity .\nThen there is what the US offers in return \u2013 aid \u2013 with AP noting : The new US aid to Vietnam includes investments to help the country transition to cleaner energy systems and expand the use of electric vehicles , and millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from the Vietnam War .\nRegarding \u201c cleaner energy , \u201d this may refer to US pressure on Vietnam to avoid construction of cheaper coal-fired power plants built in cooperation with China in favor of more expensive liquid natural gas ( LNG ) plants built through US financing and fired with US-delivered LNG .\nUS LNG will also be more expensive and can only be \u201c competitive \u201d through a constant and ever-expanding regime of sanctions and conflicts used to make cheaper alternatives inaccessible .\nAlso noted was the US elevating its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive partnership \u201d to a \u201c strategic partnership , \u201d although this is clearly being done as a means for Washington to use Vietnam amid its current regional confrontation \u2013 even as it provides token \u201c investments \u201d to clean up unexploded ordnance ( UXO ) from its last confrontation in the region \u2013 with Vietnam itself .\nIn essence , the US promise to Vietnam is to enlist it as a pawn in a Washington-engineered confrontation with Vietnam \u2019 s geographical neighbor and its largest trading partner .\nLittle was indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from \u201c signing up \u201d beyond the token \u201c investments \u201d offered in areas like pharmaceuticals and UXO removal or its coercive \u201c cleaner energy \u201d plans involving overpriced US-delivered LNG .\nCompare US Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 trip to Vietnam and the token aid and promises of ensnaring conflict offered by Washington to recent news regarding Vietnam-China relations .\nXinhua reported the first China-Europe freight train connection between Hanoi , Vietnam-Zhengzhou , China-Liege , Belgium .\nVietnam \u2019 s inclusion into China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been long in the making with several rail routes explored to connect Vietnam more readily with China and then to extend Vietnam \u2019 s reach into international markets through China \u2019 s China-Europe railway .\nWith the first Vietnamese goods now reaching Belgium , the tangible economic benefits of good ties with China are demonstrated rather than pontificated .\nViet Nam News in its article , \u201c Vietnam Railways launches freight train service to Belgium , \u201d would report : Vietnam Railways ( VNR ) on July 20 added a new rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the first train departing from Y\u00ean Vi\u00ean station , H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i , and expected to arrive at Liege City in Belgium .\nIt would also note : VNR said the train carried 23 containers with such goods as textile , leather and footwear .\nDuring its journey , the train will stop at Zhenzhou City of China \u2019 s Henan Province and connect to the Asia-Europe train to reach its destination .\nAs the service gains popularity with companies both in Europe and in Vietnam and as China continues expanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines in between , this trade will only further expand , competing with maritime shipping in terms of economics and shipping time , as well as in terms of circumventing maritime security threats and bottlenecks .\nVietnam will have the opportunity to expand its trade with Europe by diversifying its exports thanks to new options available to ship them .\nThe New Silk Road also passes through Russia and Central Asia with new routes being planned .\nVietnamese exports and thus the Vietnamese economy stands to gain thanks to China and the access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BRI the US is committed to not only \u201c countering \u201d through proposed \u201c alternatives , \u201d but also and perhaps primarily through physically cutting it off using state-sponsored terrorism as observed in Baluchistan , Pakistan and across Myanmar currently .\nVietnam , like many nations in Southeast Asia seeks to diversify its diplomatic and economic relations to avoid overdependence .\nWhile this presents a huge opportunity for the US , Washington lacks the tools to properly exploit it .\nInstead , it uses the smokescreen of providing an alternative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always done , seek political and economic control over other nations , impeding their growth to both deny them as prosperous partners for adversaires like Russia and China , but to also prevent them from independently competing against US interests in the region and around the globe .\nUltimately and regardless of Beijing and Washington \u2019 s past relations with Vietnam , the question must be asked ; today , who stands most to benefit from a prosperous Vietnam and why ?\nFor Beijing , it stands to benefit from Vietnam as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from the growth of Vietnamese exports flowing over its New Silk Road .\nFor Washington , it benefits only as far as it can use Vietnam to encircle and contain China \u2013 a proposition that benefits the peace and prosperity neither of Vietnam nor the region it resides in .\nChina is offering Vietnam continued opportunities to expand trade and economic prosperity .\nThe US seems to be offering the very opposite \u2013 courses of action aimed at restraining or even endangering trade and prosperity .\nNote to readers : Please click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to your email lists

sort of bellwether for a multitude of trends from economics to geopolitics .\nThe Singaporean government is able to quickly and flexibly adapt to changing trends , more so than anywhere else , because of its small size \u2013 an advantage that Singapore enjoys and which compensates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city-state of only 5.7 million people .\nThe most recent example of Singapore \u2019 s role as an economic and geopolitical bellwether was during US Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 tour of several Southeast Asian nations including Singapore .\nThe visit itself , as well as how Western and Chinese media covered it , speaks volumes to the changes we are seeing in the Indo-Pacific region and how well or poorly America \u2019 s strategy of encircling and containing China is going .\nLet \u2019 s first look at how the Western media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore .\nAP in its article , \u201c Harris meets with Singapore officials to begin Asia visit , \u201d would begin by claiming : The White House on Monday announced a series of new agreements with Singapore aimed at combating cyberthreats , tackling climate change , addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and alleviating supply chain issues .\nThe announcements coincide with Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 visit to the region , as part of the Biden administration \u2019 s efforts to counter Chinese influence there .\nThe article spends several paragraphs describing otherwise ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , made , or deepened during the visit and then doubled down on emphasizing \u201c countering China , \u201d saying : Harris \u2019 Southeast Asian trip , which brings Harris to Singapore and then later to Vietnam this week , is aimed at broadening cooperation with both nations to offer a counterweight to China \u2019 s growing influence in the region .\nThe article notes that Singapore hosts a US naval presence but that it also seeks to maintain strong ties with China .\nThis is not surprising as over 70 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese citizens have been coming to Singapore for years to study and work and more importantly , learn from Singapore \u2019 s technocratic and meritocratic style of governance .\nBeijing \u2019 s non-interference approach to foreign policy and its business-first emphasis provides it an advantage over Washington \u2019 s insistence on injecting itself into everything from domestic politics under the guise of \u201c human rights \u201d advocacy , to pressuring nations in the region , including Singapore , to join it in transforming ordinary maritime disputes in the South China Sea into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore \u2019 s small size means that it must bend with the geopolitical wind in terms of both strength and direction .\nDuring the ongoing COVID-19 crisis , Singapore \u2019 s policies reflected America \u2019 s still very strong grip on global pharmaceutical production and distribution .\nIn other fields , however , especially in terms of economics and geopolitics , the US is faltering , and as it does , Singapore \u2019 s stance has begun to increasingly reflect this .\nBuried deep within AP \u2019 s article , almost toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in a recent interview that Singapore will \u201c be useful but we will not be made use of \u201d in its relations with both countries , and the nation \u2019 s prime minister previously warned the US against pursuing an aggressive approach to China .\nSoutheast Asia counts China as its largest trade partner , investor , source of tourism , an increasingly important military and infrastructure partner , and \u2013 in general \u2013 the engine of growth and development for the entire region .\nSingapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seek nor desires America \u2019 s \u201c counterweight \u201d to what Singapore itself sees as constructive ties it will benefit from by expanding further .\nNext , let \u2019 s take a look at how Chinese state media presented US Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 visit to Singapore and the notion of the US providing a \u201c counterweight \u201d to Singapore-Chinese ties .\nThe Global Times in its article , \u201c Singapore draws line between \u2018 being useful \u2019 and \u2018 being made use of \u2019 , \u201d in title alone skips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus on in its article , and gets directly to the heart of Washington \u2019 s true purpose in sending Vice President Harris to Southeast Asia \u2013 recruiting nations into its encirclement and containment policy versus China .\nThe article \u2019 s first paragraph says it all : As a quasi-ally of the US , Singapore \u2019 s stance toward the US and China is telling .\nSingapore \u2019 s Channel News Asia released on Sunday an interview with Vivian Balakrishnan , the country \u2019 s foreign minister who said Singapore will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made use of \u201d in its relations with both China and the US .\nHe also said Singapore will not become \u201c one or the other \u2019 s stalking horse to advance negative agendas.\n\u201d The article distills the matter further by stating : The US has ratcheted up efforts to win over Southeast Asian countries , manifested by Harris \u2019 visit to Singapore and Vietnam and other senior US officials \u2019 tours to the region in the past two months .\nYet it will only enable Southeast Asian countries to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation and only focusing on its own interests .\nWashington does not view them as real partners , but as tools it can exploit to serve its strategies .\nThe US debacle in Afghanistan is the very example that when the US finds it not cost-effective , it will only abandon its allies or partners without hesitation .\nAnd it is very difficult to argue against this very important point .\nThe US spent two-decades occupying and running Afghanistan .\nAfter twenty years , what the US \u201c built \u201d in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those it had promised to back as American allies found themselves clinging to US aircraft attempting to escape a country the US used , abused , and is now in the process of discarding .\nWorse still for Washington \u2019 s reputation as a \u201c reliable partner , \u201d China has already begun real reconstruction in Afghanistan \u2013 even before the US has completed its withdrawal .\nRoads , rail , and factories are already in use and standing-by for a greater commitment and expansion from Beijing and Chinese enterprises both state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe difference between US contractors and Chinese enterprises is that US contractors came to Afghanistan to fulfill specific projects and would then leave to spend their money back home .\nLittle concern was given to whether or not these projects succeeded \u2013 and in reality \u2013 if they failed it would only mean more lucrative contracts in the future to try again .\nFor Chinese enterprises , the idea is to do business in Afghanistan .\nPeace , stability , and well-developed infrastructure , and a well-developed , prosperous market among Afghans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus we see a perfect example of how the outcomes of partnerships with either the US or China are designed into the actual processes involved in these partnerships .\nThe US pursues a purely exploitative model which could not even really be accurately described as a \u201c partnership.\n\u201d China , on the other hand , depends on actual partnership \u2013 on win-win outcomes between China and its partners to facilitate profits and progress for its own interests .\nOne of these models over the past twenty years has revealed itself an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this failure and provides an alternative for nations faced with picking the former .\nThere is no reason to believe US foreign policy changes at its core when its focus moves from Central Asia to Southeast Asia .\nIn fact , it is very obvious that it hasn \u2019 t .\nThe exact same \u201c development \u201d mechanisms used to loot and abuse Afghans are presented to ASEAN as a \u201c counterweight \u201d to China in the Indo-Pacific region .\nThese include an overemphasis on military alliances , dependence on USAID , and @

tested could give Pyongyang another way to evade its neighbors \u2019 missile defenses , say analysts .\nThe \u201c newly-developed long-range cruise missiles \u201d flew 1,500 kilometers over North Korean territory before successfully hitting their targets , North Korean state media reported Monday .\nThe article would also note Washington \u2019 s reaction , claiming : In a statement , the US military said it was aware of the reported launches and is monitoring and consulting closely with its allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPRK \u2019 s continuing focus on developing its military program and the threats that poses to its neighbors and the international community , \u201d the statement read .\nNorth Korea has not fought a war since hostilities ended during the Korean War .\nThe United States , on the other hand , has since waged multiple wars of aggression including the highly destructive Vietnam War ravaging all of Indochina , and in the 21st Century , the illegal invasions of Iraq , Afghanistan , and Syria , the US-led military campaign against Libya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has waged through its allies including the destructive , still ongoing conflict in Yemen all but fought by America itself through its Saudi allies .\nConsidering America \u2019 s track record , North Korea having 30,000 US troops sitting on its border with South Korea is clearly justification enough to pursue a wide scale defense program aimed at preventing Pyongyang from joining the long and always growing list of victims of US military aggression .\nThe US has no genuine concern regarding the \u201c threat \u201d North Korea poses to its neighbors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US itself has created a persistent threat against North Korea on its borders , then presents North Korea \u2019 s continued arms programs in reaction to this threat as a pretext to maintain a US military presence on the Korean Peninsula \u2013 not necessarily to invade and topple the North Korean government \u2013 although that is certainly a secondary objective \u2013 but instead to contribute toward Washington \u2019 s long-standing efforts to encircle and contain China .\nAccording to the US State Department \u2019 s own Office of the Historian in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Secretary of Defense McNamara to President Johnson , \u201d the Vietnam War at the time was viewed as necessary only if it was \u201c in support of a long-run United States policy to contain Communist China.\n\u201d The document identified Korea specifically as part of one of three fronts along which the US would contain China : There are three fronts to a long-run effort to contain China ( realizing that the USSR \u201c contains \u201d China on the north and northwest ) : ( a ) the Japan-Korea front ; ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) the Southeast Asia front .\nMore recently , the deployment of US-built Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) systems to South Korea was allegedly done to protect South Korea from North Korean missiles , but is quite clearly the continuation of Washington \u2019 s long-standing policy of containing China today .\nNorth Korea has had the means of striking South Korea for decades including with ballistic missiles , yet never has .\nThe sudden \u201c need \u201d for anti-missile systems to counter missiles that were unlikely to ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted by governments and pundits in both Beijing and Washington \u2019 s orbits as ultimately cover for systems intended for conflict with China instead .\nTHAAD missiles are not intended to protect South Korea at all \u2013 they are intended to protect US forces stationed in South Korea in the event China launches retaliation strikes amid a US-provoked conflict in the Pacific .\nFar from mere speculation , the scenario and obvious motives for the US provoking such a conflict with China sooner rather than later is laid out in precise detail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c War with China : Thinking Through the Unthinkable.\n\u201d The paper looks at a hypothetical conflict fought anywhere between 2015 and 2025 noting that as more time goes by , the stronger China \u2019 s economic and military capabilities become , and the less likely the US will be able to wage and win a war against China .\nThe obvious implication is that once a US victory over China of any sort becomes impossible , China will have irreversibly surpassed the United States and the \u201c international order \u201d it presumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than later is expected to be limited and confined to conventional weapons , fought primarily in the Pacific with targets in Chinese territory attacked by US forces .\nThe paper notes that China \u2019 s military is concentrated in Chinese territory and that China lacks conventional weapon systems capable of striking the US homeland .\nThe paper all but admits that any conflict between China and the United States would require the US military to be in close proximity to Chinese territory , thousands of miles from America \u2019 s own shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nVirtually every scenario presented by RAND authors regarding the triggering of such a conflict is rooted in ongoing tensions deliberately and continuously stoked by US interference everywhere from the South China Sea to the strait separating the Chinese mainland from Taiwan .\nIn such a conflict , the US fears most of all the targeting of its bases in both Japan and South Korea from where it would be launching military strikes against Chinese targets .\nTHAAD defense systems are there specifically to defend those bases and nothing else .\nAny collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korean populations by a retaliatory attack by China on US bases in the region is admittedly part of a plan to drag at least one or both nations into the conflict alongside the US .\nJapan \u2019 s entry would be likely if the nation were party to the underlying dispute and almost certain if its territory ( where US bases are ) were attacked .\nTHAAD missiles and other defensive systems placed in either Japan or South Korea , predicated on the alleged threat North Korea poses to both nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to fit into the RAND Corporation \u2019 s optimal timeframe for a successful US-led limited conflict with China .\nThe net result will of course be economic ruin for all of Asia , not just China .\nThe region will be set back decades by even a short conflict the RAND Corporation predicts will be \u201c intensely violent.\n\u201d Even if the US \u201c lost \u201d such a conflict militarily , the economic damage would still present Washington with a strategic victory .\nThis would fulfill US foreign policy objectives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for decades to come \u2013 not because it out-competed China , but because it knocked the entire region down faster than the US itself is declining , and knocked the entire region down lower than the current state of American social , political , economic , and military deterioration .\nThe ultimate irony is that American accusations against North Korea of being a regional and global threat are part of the US \u2019 s own attempts to continue preparing the battleground for a sought-after

does not get any messier or more chaotic than this .\nSince 2009 , when Australia \u2019 s Future Submarine Program ( FSP ) known as Project SEA 1000 , began to take shape , strategists and policy makers have been keen to pursue the next big White Elephant of defence spending .\nAnd few areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure are more costly \u2013 often mindlessly so \u2013 than submarines .\nThe Australian effort here is particularly impressive .\nPick a real winner by signing a contract for a yet to be designed attack class submarine , supposedly necessary in an increasingly dangerous region .\nEnsure that this design is based on a nuclear model and remove that attribute , aptly described as \u201c dumbing down a nuclear submarine by removing the whole basis of its superior capability , and then charging at least twice as much for a far less capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure the order is for 12 of these yet to be designed and built creatures .\nMake sure , as well , that they are only ready sometime in the 2030s , by which time they risk being obsolete in a field of other contending submarines with superior capabilities .\nThe dubious honour for this monumentally foolish contract , with an initial cost of AU $ 50 billion , fell to the French submarine company DCNS ( now called Naval Group ) .\nIt nudged out German and Japanese contenders with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d a government announcement in April 2016 explained , \u201c was driven by DCNS \u2019 s ability to best meet all of the Australian Government requirements .\nThese included superior sensor performance and stealth characteristics , as well as range and endurance similar to the Collins class submarine .\nThe Government \u2019 s considerations also included cost , schedule , program execution , through-life support and Australian industry involvement.\n\u201d The contract warmed the French military establishment .\nIt was praised as the \u201c contract of the century \u201d .\nLe Parisien \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs .\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande could say that he was also capable of pulling off a contract to aid the French military industrial complex , despite being a socialist

to concede in an estimates hearing before Australian senators that another AU $ 50 billion would be required to sustain the submarines for the duration of their operating life .\n\u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sustainment will be determined during the design process through choices made but at this point early estimation of the sustainment costs for the fleet are of the order of up to $ 50 billion on a constant price basis.\n\u201d Tiffs and disagreements over distribution of labour and further costs started to bite .\nHow much of the work would actually be undertaken by labour based in Australia ?\nWould the French company be keeping the lion \u2019 s share ?\nWith such problems , and the pace of development , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls of defence : a competing , cheaper design , based on a rejigged version of Australia \u2019 s existing Collins Class submarine , might be a suitable alternative .\nIn the meantime , perhaps a German alternative might also figure , namely the Type 214 diesel electric submarine developed by Howaldtswerker-Deutsche Werft GmbH ( HDW ) .\nIn May , Naval Group \u2019 s Transfer of Technology program manager Fabrice Leduc solemnly told his staff that the submarine project had been subjected to a \u201c political timeline \u201d following a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new occupant , Peter Dutton , was biding his time because \u201c he wanted to have some strong warranties from the industry and especially Naval Group in terms of cost and schedule.\n\u201d The marriage had truly soured .\nOn September 15 , the press gallery in Canberra was awash with rumours that a divorce was being proposed .\nIn the early hours of the following day , the question as to whether Australia would be dissolving its union with Naval Group was answered .\nIn place of that union would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and United Kingdom , a security three-way with Australia as the subordinate partner .\nThe glue that will hold this union together is a common suspicion : China .\nIn place of the Attack Class submarine : a nuclear powered alternative with Anglo-American blessing , based on the US Virginia class or UK Astute class .\nIn their joint statement announcing the creation of AUKUS , a name deserving a place in a science fiction glossary , the joint leaders of the three countries \u201c guided \u201d by their \u201c enduring ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order

\u201c interoperability , commonality , and mutual benefit.\n\u201d Australia \u2019 s submarine policy has previously eschewed nuclear propulsion .\nNow , as a dowry for receiving such largesse ,

mainstream media sources like the network SBS .\nFor example , Kim Woo-gyeong , a lawyer representing the student Hong Ye-young , filed an emergency request to stop mandatory vaccines for third-year high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 at the Cheongju local court\u2013where the Disease Control and Prevention Agency ( DCPA ) is located .\nThe request was but part of a legal effort to block the dangerous

become the default government of South Korea over the last year , working together with corrupt elements in the National Intelligence Service and in the corporate world to force-feed the vaccine regime to the Korean people .\nIn most likelihood , the sudden change of the judge was the result of the use of classified directives within DCPA that make it impossible for the government to reveal the nature of internal governance .\nThe fight against bio-fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific , is clearly growing in Korea .\nAlthough traditionally Koreans tend to have a high level of trust in the government , as opposed to Americans and Europeans , now that the official numbers of dead as result of vaccines have surpassed 700 ( which is just a fraction of the actual number killed ) an unspoken unease is creeping into conversations .\nWhereas friends asked each other whether they had been vaccinated as a new greeting , and donned that cute \u201c I was vaccinated \u201d buttons given out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands for the execution of public officials on the internet are increasing .\nYou would never guess if you looked at the television news .\nHalf of content is people lining up for vaccines , discussions of the merits of different brands of vaccines , and interviews with happy children who tell us how great they feel after their jabs .\nIt is only right-wing media sources , like the Epoch Times ( run by the Falungong cult ) , that are permitted to report on the dangers of the vaccines in depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not represent the high quality of journalism at the Epoch Times , a far-right anti-communist journal funded by a handful of rich patrons in Taiwan and elsewhere , but is rather the product of an intentional political game wherein only the most virulent anti-Chinese

claims in the South China Sea and other maritime theaters .\nThe nuclear submarines will tilt the region \u2019 s strategic balance and potentially cause China to concentrate more of its security energies closer to home and less so on far-flung theaters .\nFrom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a coordinated encirclement strategy that Beijing will certainly view as a threat to its plans to increase and strengthen its presence in the Indian Ocean region .\nMeanwhile , the US and India signed a new agreement on July 30 to jointly develop Air-Launched Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( ALUAV ) .\nThe deal is the latest under the Research , Development , Testing and Evaluation Memorandum Agreement between India \u2019 s Ministry of Defense and the US Defense Department first signed in 2006 and renewed in 2015 .\nA September 3 statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards \u201c deepening defense technology collaboration between the two nations through co-development of defense equipment.\n\u201d Needless to say , the target of the deal is China .\nJust as provocatively , US ally Japan is now staging its largest military drills since 1993 , separately but hardly by coincidence at the same time Taiwan has launched a new major military exercise known as Han Kuang to strengthen combat readiness in the event of a Chinese attack .\nChina considers self-governing Taiwan a renegade province that must be \u201c reunified \u201d with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jinping has indicated is a near-term priority .\nTaiwan \u2019 s incorporation into the mainland would undermine the US \u2019 strategic advantage in the Indo-Pacific , making the island a strategic center point of the new Cold War .\nChina was not explicitly mentioned as a target in any of the recent deals , tie-ups and exercises .\nIndeed , Biden administration officials who briefed reporters after the nuclear sub announcement said specifically that the new trilateral partnership \u201c was not aimed at countering Beijing.\n\u201d The US-India deal was likewise announced without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaking that Biden is actualizing his vow to build alliances of so-called like-minded powers to tackle and confront China \u2019 s rise .\nThat alliance-building will be underscored at Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , or Quad , meeting at the White House in Washington on September 24 .\nThe Quad , a strategic tie-up of the US , Australia , Japan and India , is in China \u2019 s crosshairs .\nThe Global Times , a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece , ran a September 15 editorial headlined \u201c Quad summit will see limited concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Australia are \u2018 four ward mates with different illnesses \u2019 : experts.\n\u201d The commentary said , \u201c the summit will make no big chance [ SIC ] in its hostility against China , though the statement released by the White House about the summit didn \u2019 t mention China.\n\u201d L\u00fc Xiang , a specialist in US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and one of the Global Times \u2019 cited \u201c experts \u201d , spoke to contradictions and weaknesses in the Quad : \u201c The US hasty pull-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Australia refused to make promise on coal mining for the climate change issue ; Japan is now facing a chaotic political situation , and is being unwisely provocative toward China due to the Taiwan question.\n\u201d The Global Times has it right from one perspective : \u201c hostility against China \u201d is rising precisely due to Beijing \u2019 s increasingly assertive moves in the Indian and Pacific Oceans , an outward thrust that the Biden administration and its allies are broadly countering in the name of maintaining a \u201c free and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective from fighting terrorism to countering China is open and clear .\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris renewed that pledge during a visit to Singapore and Vietnam in late August literally coincident with America \u2019 s withdrawal from Afghanistan , where she said the US \u201c will pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific that promotes our interests and those of our partners and allies.\n\u201d Like the Global Times , Harris did not mince words when she said \u201c In the South China Sea , we know that Beijing continues to coerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of the South China Sea \u201d [ and ] \u201c Beijing \u2019 s actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations.\n\u201d After four years of what many viewed as four years of neglect , mixed messaging and miscues under former president Donald Trump , the US under Biden is making clear the US \u2019 renewed commitment to the region .\nUS ally Britain is also back in the region in a muscular manner not seen in decades .\nA strike group led by aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China Sea in route to Japan in July , a freedom of navigation flex that elicited a strong response from China .\nBritain \u201c is still living in its colonial days \u201d , fumed Global Times \u2019 columnist Lin Lan on July 26 while taking shots at issues unrelated to the aircraft carrier \u2019 s voyage in China \u2019 s nearby waters .\n\u201c While Britain is trying to show off its strength , its own problems are acute .\nOn July 14 , a Covid-19 outbreak was reported on the HMS Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the UK \u2019 s economy has fallen into recession and about one-fifth of UK pensioners are living in poverty , according to an analysis of government figures in June.\n\u201d The Global Times also shot at Japan \u2019 s recent military exercise .\nColumnists Yang Sheng and Liu Xuanzun wrote on September 15 : \u201c Right-wing political forces in Japan have been lying to the Japanese public about the essence of the Diaoyu Islands issue [ disputed islands in the East China Sea ] and Taiwan question .\n\u201c Now the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , and this is why the massive drills targeting China could win support for Japanese politicians.\n\u201d Their comments were punctuated with what could be construed as a veiled warning from Beijing : \u201c But to what extent Japan would intervene militarily , the US has the final say \u2026 China is prepared for the worst-case scenario \u2014 the US and its allies , including Japan , launch an all-out military intervention to interrupt China \u2019 s national reunification.\n\u201d But China \u2019 s leadership has been doing more than printing provocative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences .\nIn a sign of China \u2019 s wider global ambitions , Beijing recently built a 330-meter-long pier large enough to accommodate an aircraft carrier at its naval base in Djibouti , China \u2019 s only foreign military base strategically located at the southern entrance of the Red Sea .\nChina \u2019 s first domestically made aircraft carrier , the Shandong , has completed regular testing and training missions at sea that focused on actual combat after serving in the People \u2019 s Liberation Army Navy for 10 months , China Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From there , China \u2019 s navy can readily monitor traffic to and from the Suez Canal \u2014 and collect vital intelligence from the entire region .\nAt least 2,000 Chinese navy personnel are present at the Djibouti base , which has been expanded gradually since it was opened in August 2017 .\nTo be sure , China \u2019 s move into the Indian Ocean makes strategic sense .\nChristopher Colley , a security analyst writing in the Washington-based War on the Rocks , recently noted : \u201c Roughly 80 % of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Ocean and Malacca Strait \u201d and that \u201c in addition , 95 % of China \u2019 s trade with the Middle East , Africa , and Europe passes through the Indian Ocean .\nMore importantly from Beijing \u2019 s perspective , this region is controlled by Chinese rivals : the United States and India.\n\u201d Japan and Australia , which also see less benign motives behind China \u2019 s interest in the Indian Ocean , could be added to that list .\nIts newly established presence has unmistakably shifted the huge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their mutual detriment , particularly as China projects power through two aircraft carriers , the Liaoning and Shandong , with a third under development .\nChina \u2019 s increasing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean has been seen in the growing presence of Chinese survey ships and submarines .\nIn January , the Paris-based Naval News website reported that Chinese ships \u201c have been carrying out a systematic mapping of the [ Indian Ocean \u2019 s ] seafloor .\nThis may relate to submarine warfare.\n\u201d That echoes a 2020 US Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have an Indian Ocean fleet \u201c in the near future.\n\u201d Image on the right : The 16th installment of the China

over Australia \u2019 s scrapping of a major submarine deal with a French company , few countries were as surprised as Australia \u2019 s neighbours to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , Indonesia and Malaysia have come out strongly against Australia \u2019 s plan to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines with the help of the US and UK .\nEven Singapore , Australia \u2019 s most reliable ally in the region , has expressed concern .\nThe Afghanistan debacle has left a bad taste among many Indo-Pacific countries , and some are wondering if the timing of the AUKUS announcement was intended as a show of US power in the region to reassure jittery partners .\nTo understand the deep anxiety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals requires some context on where they are coming from .\nFirst , many of them think there is no such thing as acquiring nuclear-powered submarines without the prospect of acquiring nuclear weapons in the future .\nAustralia has not joined the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , which requires parties to agree not to develop , test , produce , acquire , possess , stockpile or threaten to use nuclear weapons .\nThe Morrison government says the treaty would be inconsistent with its alliance with the US , a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1973 and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1998 .\nAnd Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last week Australia has \u201c no plans \u201d to pursue nuclear weapons .\nYet , some ASEAN countries are worried the AUKUS agreement is a clear signal the West will take a more aggressive stand towards China by admitting Australia to the nuclear club .\nBoth Indonesia ( the unofficial leader of ASEAN ) and Malaysia fear AUKUS will also lead to a major arms race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for conflict in South China Sea The new agreement also signals that the US , Australia and UK view the South China Sea as a key venue for this contest against China .\nThe ASEAN nations have always preached maintaining southeast Asia as a \u201c zone of peace , freedom and neutrality \u201d , free from interference by any outside powers .\nIn 1995 , the member states also signed the Treaty of Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone , which committed to keep nuclear weapons out of the region .\nNot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nAlthough everyone knows China , the US , Britain and France have ignored these protocols by manoeuvring armed warshipsthrough the South China Sea \u2014 not to mention China \u2019 s building of military bases on disputed islands there \u2014 ASEAN does not want to see this number grow .\nAustralian nuclear-powered submarines have the potential to change the dynamics in the South China Sea and make the Chinese much more nervous .\nThere have already been plenty of \u201c close encounter \u201d incidents between the Chinese and US navies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese navy and ships belonging to ASEAN members .\nThe region doesn \u2019 t need yet another potential \u201c close encounter \u201d to worry about .\nThe ASEAN states are already very worried about the China-US rivalry playing out in its backyard .\nAnd the new AUKUS agreement reinforces the idea that the opinions of the ASEAN members matter little when it comes to the superpowers and how they operate in the region .\nThe region has always insisted on the idea of \u201c ASEAN centrality \u201d in their relations with the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best for Southeast Asia \u2014 but as AUKUS shows , nuclear nations play a different game .\nIndonesia is especially unhappy with Australia given the new agreement will affect it directly , given their common maritime border .\nMorrison had already been forced to cancel his upcoming trip to Jakarta after Prime Minister Joko Widodo said he would be unavailable to meet \u2014 a decision that was made before the AUKUS announcement .\nThis will add another layer to the strained relationship .\nIs there anyone happy about the deal ?\nWhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expressed uneasiness with AUKUS , there is a school of thought that says the more hawkish voices in the region will probably accept the agreement in the long term , as it will help keep China \u2019 s aggression in check .\nFor those in the \u201c hawk \u201d camp , the number one long-term threat to regional security is China .\nMany think the strategic balance of power has been tilting too much in Beijing \u2019 s favour in the past decade , especially after China started rushing to build military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using its navy to protect Chinese fishing vessels in disputed waters .\nSo , they believe any moves to remind China it does not have a carte blanche to do what it wants in Southeast Asia is a good thing .\nJapan and South Korea are clearly in this camp and their muted reaction to AUKUS suggests they are in favour of a \u201c re-balancing \u201d in the region .\nTaiwan and Vietnam are probably on this side , as well .\nThe only downside is that Australia may use its nuclear-powered submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses its nuclear submarines as a bargaining chip , it will simply turn public opinion in the region against Australia .\nIf anything , the AUKUS move reinforced the widely held perception that Australia \u2019 s mantra of being \u201c part of the region \u201d is , in fact , \u201c empty talk \u201d .\nAustralia has firmly signalled its intentions to put its Anglo allies in the US and UK first .\nAUKUS also reinforces the view that Australia can not be accepted as a regional partner or player .\nThis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For years , the ASEAN bloc has seen Australia as \u201c deputy sheriff \u201d to the US , though this view would not necessarily be shared in public .\nSo , while AUKUS came as a surprise to many in the region , an alliance of this sort was probably bound to happen .\nIt \u2019 s just that nobody expected it to happen so soon .\nNote to

.\nVisit and follow us on Instagram at @ crg_globalresearch .\nIt seems utterly beyond debate but acknowledging legal rights to clean hair has assumed the makings of a slow march over the years .\nThe 1956 Clean Air Act in Britain arose from the lethal effects of London \u2019 s 1952 killer smog , which is said to have taken some 12,000 lives .\nThe Act granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ householders to shift to the use of cleaner fuels ( gas , electricity , smokeless solid fuel ) .\nThere is certainly no shortage of advocates for the self-evident point that clean air is vital .\nSome of this has been reduced \u2013 at least historically \u2013 to an issue about the non-smoker \u2019 s wish not to have the air clouded by the selfish actions of a smoker .\nBut this is small beer when compared to the general levels of global pollution that keeps the Grim Reaper busy on an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization , air pollution kills 7 million or so people each year , with 9 out of 10 people breathing air \u201c that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants , with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.\n\u201d In 2019 , the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment David R. Boyd noted approvingly that a majority of States had , be it through their constitutions , statutes and regional treaties , recognised the right to a healthy environment .\nBut recognition for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfulfilled object .\nThe UN General Assembly , for instance , may have adopted a range of resolutions on the right to clean water , but never on the right to clean air .\nThis is despite such a right being , according to Boyd , \u201c implicit in a number of international human rights instruments , including the Universal Declaration to Human Rights ( right to adequate standard of living ) , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( right to life ) and the International Covenant on Economic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health ) .\n\u201d This month , a flutter of interest was caused by a ruling in the Central Jakarta District Court on a lawsuit lodged two years before accusing the Indonesian government of unlawfully permitting air pollution in the capital to exceed permissible , healthy limits .\nCitizens such as Istu Prayogi , who had never so much as touched a cigarette in their lives , joined the suit after his lungs revealed the sort of lung damage that would arise from being a heroic , persistent smoker .\nThe unanimous decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven officials concerned , including President Joko Widodo , three cabinet ministers and the governors of Jakarta , Banten and West Java were negligent in not upholding environmental standards .\nAs Duta Baskara , one of the panel members observed , \u201c They have been negligent in fulfilling the rights of citizens to a good and healthy environment.\n\u201d The judges , however , dismissed the applicants \u2019 submission claiming that the president had violated human rights .\nThe court directed that the seven officials take serious action to guarantee the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations and implementing measures to protect human health , the environment and ecosystems informed by science and technology .\nEnvironmental laws would also have to be policed more rigorously , along with the imposition of sanctions for offenders .\nThe scale of this effort is hard to exaggerate .\nOn June 4 , 2019 , Jakarta registered the worst air quality in the world , if one takes the readings of the air quality monitoring app AirVisual as accurate .\nAt 210 on the Air Quality Index ( AQI ) , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluters such as New Delhi , Beijing and Dubai .\nRapporteur Boyd also offered his services to the 32 applicants , writing in his supporting brief that , \u201c Protecting human rights from the harmful effects of air pollution is a constitutional and legislative obligation for governments in Indonesia , not an option.\n\u201d The director of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment , Nur Hidayati , affirmed this view to The Jakarta Post in early June that breathing \u201c clean air is our right that the government has to fulfil.\n\u201d These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative realm of legal reasoning .\nThe right to clean air in Indonesia is guaranteed by such legal documents as the country \u2019 s 1945 Constitution and the 1999 Law on Environmental Protection and Management .\nBut the writ of law is not always a guarantee of its policing .\nBefore the September decision , Jakarta \u2019 s governor , Anies Baswedan , did not feel that a ruling against the authorities would cause much fuss .\nAs the governor \u2019 s climate change envoy Irvan Pulunga explained , \u201c The governor doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance to the government \u2019 s work but a vehicle for collaboration.\n\u201d Pulungan also insisted that improvements had been made to the city \u2019 s air quality over the course of two years .\nThis tune coming from the office of president has been somewhat different , more a case of fleeing rather than addressing a problem .\nIn part , this is understandable , given that Jakarta has become a city of nightmares for policy makers , urban planners and the authorities .\nFew such concentrations of humanity on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To debilitating air pollution can be added flooding , regular seismic activity and gradual subsidence .\nOnly a month after the lawsuit was filed , the president proposed relocating the capital to another spot to be built in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo .\n\u201c The burden Jakarta is holding right now , \u201d he claimed at the time , \u201c is too heavy as the centre of governance , business , finance , trade and services.\n\u201d Such moves promise to abandon one problem by creating another , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalimantan .\nShowing a spirit not exactly collaborative in nature , an appeal against the ruling is expected by the government .\nJakarta \u2019 s governor , in particular , finds himself facing a range of orders from the court , including designing environmental \u201c strategies \u201d and policies to mitigate the air pollution \u201d under the direction of the supervision of the Home Affairs Minister .\nModest as it is , the victory for the applicants in the Central Jakarta District Court shows , at the very least , that that courts @ @ @ @

defense alliance.\n\u201d Despite claims that the alliance is aimed at no particular country ( and no particular country was mentioned during its announcement ) , the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and China \u2013 the obvious target of this \u201c AUKUS \u201d alliance \u2013 doesn \u2019 t perceive it as such .\nThe Guardian in its article , \u201c Alliance with Australia and US a \u2018 downpayment on global Britain \u2019 , \u201d would explicitly state : Britain \u2019 s post-Brexit foreign policy is taking shape , and the early moves are hardly very surprising : a tripartite defence alliance with the US and Australia \u2013 handily compressed to Aukus \u2013 clearly designed to send a message to Beijing .\nChinese state media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly clear that China understood this with a headline reading , \u201c AUKUS another hostile signal to China , worsens Asia-Pacific security.\n\u201d AUKUS begins with the three nations announcing plans to design , develop , and deliver nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia , which currently has 6 Collins-class diesel electric submarines delivered between the late 1990 \u2019 s and early 2000 \u2019 s .\nThe abovementioned Guardian article noted that Rolls Royce and BAE Systems would likely win contracts as part of this deal .\nConsidering the 18 month period the Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process and the several years it takes for BAE Systems to build and commission nuclear-powered submarines , Australia may put these new submarines into service around 2030 .\nThe Price of this New Alliance As an extra caveat , and perhaps warning to Australia , the new deal is likely to result in a French-Australian submarine deal falling through .\nWorth 65.6 billion US dollars , this will not be the first time US machinations have cost Paris dearly .\nIn 2015 France was forced to reimburse Russia when it failed to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pressured to cancel the deal by Washington .\nThe adage , \u201c no honor among thieves , \u201d comes to mind .\nFrance , an eager accomplice in Washington \u2019 s various wars of aggression since the turn of the century now finds itself on the receiving end of American exceptionalism .\nFrance \u2019 s misfortunes today will almost certainly be Australia \u2019 s tomorrow as \u201c AUKUS \u201d runs its course .\nIn many ways , Australia has already begun paying its own price .\nAustralia \u2019 s largest trade partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to China outmatched all Australian exports to North America and Europe combined .\nPrompted by the US to pressure China across a range of fabricated accusations , Chinese-Australian trade dropped significantly , with ABC Australia itself claiming by as much as 40 % .\nWhile Australia says it is working to compensate for these losses by expanding into alternative markets , such effort could have been used to double Australian trade rather than merely recover from politically-motivated and very much self-inflicted economic damage in its trade row with China .\nThe \u201c security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include two obvious flashpoints , both the product of persistent US provocations .\nThe first is centered around Taiwan where the current , US-backed ruling government in Taipei continues to inch toward independence .\nIt should be remembered that Taiwan is recognized by virtually all nations ( including the United States ) as part of China under the \u201c One China \u201d policy .\nTo illustrate this , the US itself does not have an official embassy in Taipei .\nBut while the US officially recognizes Taiwan \u2019 s status under international law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by supporting pro-independence political groups in Taiwan .\nThe other flashpoint is in the South China Sea where the US accuses China of \u201c bullying \u201d other nations by making \u201c excessive \u201d maritime claims .\nThe US regularly conducts \u201c Freedom of Navigation Operations \u201d ( FNOPs ) throughout the region .\nThe official US Navy website in a statement titled , \u201c 7th Fleet conducts Freedom of Navigation Operation \u201d ( July 12 , 2021 ) , for example , would claim : The United States challenges excessive maritime claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the claimant .\nThe international law of the sea as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention provides for certain rights and freedoms and other lawful uses of the sea to all nations .\nNot mentioned is the fact that the US itself is not actually a signatory of the 1982 Law of the Sea of Conventions and is in fact one of only a few nations not to sign it .\nThe US Navy also makes another telling admission when it claimed : China , Taiwan , and Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis reveals that it is not China \u201c bullying \u201d nations in the region over the South China Sea , but instead a series of overlapping claims .\nNations in the region have disputes not only with China , but also with each other .\nThis is revealed in headlines like the Wall Street Journal \u2019 s 2016 article , \u201c Indonesia Blows Up 23 Foreign Fishing Boats to Send a Message , \u201d in which the Indonesian government destroyed captured Malaysian and Vietnamese fishing boats .\nVietnamese news portal Binh Duong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizes Vietnamese fishing boats , \u201d and Bangkok Post \u2019 s article , \u201c 3 Malaysian trawlers seized near Satun , \u201d also help illustrate many nations in the region are engaged in heated maritime disputes with often theatrical results \u2013 but always avoid actual conflict and are eventually resolved bilaterally .\nThis is not unlike maritime disputes taking place anywhere else in the world , including in Europe , where just this year the New York Times reported on the mobilization of British and French naval vessels over contesting fishing waters near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved peacefully .\nThe South China Sea \u2019 s various overlapping disputes have been exploited by the US .\nWashington has injected itself into the middle of what would be commonplace and long-standing maritime disputes to depict them as one-sided bullying by China to justify America \u2019 s large and growing naval presence in the region and to recruit nations into belligerent alliances precisely like AUKUS .\nThe US even went as far as initiating a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration ( PCA ) at the Hague , the Netherlands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippines .\nIt was American lawyer Paul Reichler and the Western law firm Foley Hoag \u2013 not Filipino lawyers \u2013 who led the effort .\nThe non-binding politically-motivated ruling was not even used by the Philippines who instead opted for bilateral talks with Beijing to establish a mechanism to ease tensions in the South China Sea and even cooperate in contested waters , according to the Philippines \u2019 own Department of Foreign Affairs website .\nFor added irony and to further illustrate how these disputes are not one-sided Chinese \u201c bullying , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s ruling , not only did Beijing reject it , Taiwan did too .\nAccording to a 2016 New York Times article , Taiwan also then sent a patrol ship to the contested waters .\nTogether , with the Taiwan issue , these two flashpoints are clearly artificial , kept in motion by a constant investment by Washington in terms of political pressure and propaganda as well as a steady stream of military provocations .\nThese flashpoints are cultivated specifically to rally nations against China , to isolate and contain the rising nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension to what it itself calls its \u201c primacy \u201d over Asia .\nHowever , they may also serve as impetus for a limited US-initiated war with China , a war the US would prefer to fight sooner rather than later .\nIn a 2016 RAND Corporation paper ( PDF ) commissioned by the US Army and titled , \u201c War with China : Thinking Through the Unthinkable , \u201d a compelling argument is made for the preservation of American hegemony through a limited war predicted to remain conventional and confined to East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be regional and conventional .\nIt would be waged mainly by ships on and beneath the sea , by aircraft and missiles of many sorts , and in space ( against satellites ) and cyberspace ( against computer systems ) .\nWe assume that fighting would start and remain in East Asia , where potential Sino-US flash points and nearly all Chinese forces are located .\nIt \u2019 s worth emphasizing that US planners admit that China \u2019 s forces are confined to Chinese territory and that the only way a conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in close proximity to them and provoked into conflict where \u201c potential Sino-US flash points \u201d are located , e.g .\nthe South China Sea , or Taiwan .\nThe paper notes that the time frame studied stretched from 2015 to 2025 .\nThe paper also describes the obvious benefits of , and thus motive for the US provoking such a conflict .\nIt states : The prospect of a military standoff means that war could eventually be decided by nonmilitary factors .\nThese should favor the United States now and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both economies , damage to China \u2019 s could be catastrophic and lasting : on the order of a 25\u201335 percent reduction in Chinese gross domestic product ( GDP ) in a yearlong war , compared with a reduction in US GDP on the order of 5\u201310 percent .\nEven a mild conflict , unless ended promptly , could weaken China \u2019 s economy .\nA long and severe war could ravage China \u2019 s economy , stall its hard-earned development , and cause widespread hardship and dislocation .\nSuch economic damage could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separatists in China .\nThe US is clearly preparing the grounds for such a conflict , cultivating the very \u201c separatists \u201d the paper notes the conflict would \u201c embolden , \u201d while attacking and attempting to block China \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) which is currently diversifying away from China \u2019 s dependency on vulnerable Asia-Pacific maritime trade routes .\nThrough the creation of what are clearly military alliances like AUKUS , the US is ensuring it has the military muscle before , during , and after any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before then doubling down on a containment strategy to ensure Western hegemony over the Indo-Pacific region for decades to come .\nThe current status quo all but guarantees China \u2019 s economy ( as well as military and political influence ) will irreversibly surpass the US \u2019 within a decade .\nThe closing window of opportunity the US has to prevent China \u2019 s as well as Asia \u2019 s surpassing of the West in a transfer of primacy from West to East that has not occurred in centuries , almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only time will tell whether or not \u201c AUKUS \u201d will simply buy the US time before being surpassed by China , or if it is one of several final pieces being put in place before the hypothetical conflict RAND Corporation described in the pages of its 2016 paper is turned into a bloody reality .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below

surprise September 16 announcement that Australia was in a new security alliance with the United States , Britain and Australia \u2014 AUKUS \u2014 formalises its war drive against China .\nThe

cost , Australia is to be given US and British technology to build nuclear-powered submarines in Adelaide .\nThe two nuclear armed and powered countries will exploit a loophole in the international non-proliferation treaty : International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards allow for nuclear material to be used for \u201c non-proscribed military activity \u201d .\nAustralia is now setting a precedent for other non-nuclear weapons \u2019 states to do the same .\nWe now know that discussions have been underway between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn \u2019 t bother to inform the Australian public .\nThanks to the organising efforts of the anti-nuclear movement in the 1970s and early 1980s ( a large part in Labor \u2019 s ranks ) , Labor held the line against uranium mining and nuclear weapons .\nHuge annual marches against nuclear weapons and nuclear ships visiting Australian ports also stopped the uranium industry from gaining a bigger foothold .\nHowever , before taking office in 1983 Labor ditched its anti-uranium and anti-nuclear policies .\nNot surprisingly , Anthony Albanese said Labor \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interoperability of our defence and security arrangements \u201d .\nHe said a \u201c calm and measured approach \u201d is needed .\n\u201c A US alliance is our most important .\nAnd the UK , of course , is our old friend \u201d , Albanese said .\n\u201c So , it makes sense in terms of efficiency and in terms of maximising the positive output that we engage across our three nations to make sure that there is maximum interoperability available.\n\u201d Albanese said the conditions for Labor to support the nuclear-powered submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil nuclear industry ; no acquisition of nuclear weapons ; and that the agreement would be compatible with the non-proliferation treaty .\nHowever , as critics ( and even some supporters ) have said , the submarine deal is likely to become the launching pad for the pro-nuclear lobby to renew its push to open up uranium mining .\nAfter all , Australia has the third largest reserves of the mineral in the world .\nAustralia signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty in 1973 and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force .\nThe Morrison government has refused to sign the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , which came into force in January and now has 55 signatories , although none with nuclear capability .\nAustralia is , however , a party to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty of Rarotonga , which established a nuclear weapon-free zone in the South Pacific .\nThe new submarines will also not be welcome in New Zealand , which has maintained a ban on such potentially hazardous vessels entering its ports .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent Senator who supports Australia acquiring submarines , expressed concern at the government \u2019 s secretive decision .\nHe called for parliamentary scrutiny before the next election .\nGiven the secrecy surrounding this announcement , along with the anti-China red scare campaign , it is perhaps not too surprising that Roy Morgan \u2019 s snap poll on September 16 had 57 % agreeing with the purchase of nuclear submarines .\nPatrick agreed it would be \u201c difficult \u201d for Australia to have nuclear-powered submarines \u201c without a domestic nuclear power capability \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuclear submarine fleet without a domestic nuclear power industry is a challenge that must not be underestimated.\n\u201d Dr Vince Scappatura , spokesperson for the Independent and Peaceful Australia Network , said AUKUS would \u201c undermine Australia \u2019 s sovereign defence capabilities \u201d and will contribute to the greater militarisation of the region .\nAdam Bandt MP said the Greens would oppose the nuclear submarine deal , and called on the Labor Party to follow Paul Keating \u2019 s lead against \u201c locking in \u201d Australia \u2019 s military equipment \u201c and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US .\nSam Wainwright , a national co-convenor of the Socialist Alliance , told Green Left the new military pact was about formalising an old alliance to put

reserves.\n\u201d Australia is the only G20 country with a ban on nuclear energy , leaving uranium as an export-only commodity .\nThe value of uranium sales last year was estimated at $ 2.5 billion .\nMeanwhile , the French government has withdrawn its ambassadors from the US and Australia over being \u201c stabbed in the back \u201d .\n\u201c This is not just sour grapes over losing \u2018 the

recent debacle in Afghanistan showed , however , American influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuttal after another .\nWith the possible exception of Japan , United States influence in the region is rapidly fading , notwithstanding its provocative sailings in the South China Sea and its overt support for the island of Taiwan .\nIt is conveniently forgotten by Western commentators that from 1949 to 1972 the island of Taiwan held China \u2019 s seat on the United Nations Security Council .\nThere was no suggestion then that Taiwan was a separate country .\nIt could hardly have claimed to be , yet retaining China \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taiwan is making noises about becoming an independent country , something that the Beijing government has declared to be totally unacceptable , and which they

spectacular barbecue .\nMorale suffered , so the command gave the nod to hold a barbecue on April 10th near a large hangar for the esprit de corps of the Marines .\nHeat from the barbecue equipment triggered the hangar fire suppression system , releasing massive amounts of toxic firefighting foam containing Perfluoro octane sulfonic acid , ( PFOS ) .\nIt ruined the barbecue .\nFutenma Flightline

suppression systems unleash their foams , the military may either send the foam into storm water sewers , sanitary sewers , or underground storage tanks .\nSending the carcinogens into the storm water sewers causes the materials to run directly into the rivers .\nDischarging the foams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxins are sent to wastewater treatment facilities where they are eventually discharged , untreated , into the rivers .\nFoams captured in underground storage tanks can be sent to either of the sewer systems or removed from the site to be dumped elsewhere or incinerated .\nBecause the chemicals don

by these substances , \u201d said Schneider .\nThis is a boilerplate response used worldwide to placate the locals , whether they \u2019 re in Maryland , Germany , or Japan .\nThe military knew immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ releases will continue to occur and imperil human health .\nThe Americans rely on subservient host governments .\nFor instance , a report by the Okinawa Defense Bureau , the local branch of the Japanese Ministry of Defense , said that the foam releases at Futenma \u201c had almost no effect on humans.\n\u201d However , the Ryuko Shimpo newspaper sampled river water near the Futenma base and found 247.2 parts per trillion ( ppt ) of PFOS/PFOA in the Uchidomari River .\nSeawater from Makiminato fishing port contained 41.0 ng/l of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PFAS that are contained in the military \u2019 s aqueous film-forming foam ( AFFF ) .\nTo put these numbers into perspective , the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources says surface water levels that exceed 2

was outraged .\nHe said , \u201c I truly have no words , \u201d when he learned that a barbecue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early 2021 , the Okinawan government announced that groundwater in the area around the

Afghan civilians we recently witnessed .\nAbout 56 percent of Americans surveyed earlier this year said they have \u201c a great deal of trust and confidence \u201d in the military , down from 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness this trend accelerate while news outlets are forced to cover the military \u2019 s poisoning of America and the world .\nThere \u2019 s a deep irony in all of this .\nThe antiwar movement and mainstream environmental groups in the United States have generally been slow to embrace the issue .\nInstead , the insurgency will arise from farmers in middle America .\nA new chapter of American imperial arrogance in Okinawa unfolded on August 26 , 2021 .\nNeither the U.S. nor the Japanese have developed standards regarding the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitary sewer systems .\nIt seems both nations are fixated on the drinking water while the science is clear and irrefutable that most of the PFAS consumed by humans is through the food we eat , especially seafood from contaminated waters .\nThe military command at Futenma met with Japanese central government and Okinawan prefectural officials on July 19 , 2021 to collect samples of treated water from the base to conduct separate tests .\nA followup meeting was set for August 26th to discuss plans to release the results of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August 26th , the Marines unilaterally and maliciously dumped 64,000 liters of the poisoned water into the municipal sewer system .\nThe water came from the underground tanks that contained the spilled firefighting foam .\nThe Marines still have approximately 360,000 liters of contaminated water remaining on base , according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper .\nOkinawan officials say they received an email at 9:05 a.m. on Aug. 26 from the Marines saying water containing the toxins would be released at 9:30 a.m .\nThe U.S. military said the water released contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water .\nThe U.S. military had expressed concern that the storage tanks could overflow due to heavy rain brought by typhoons , while the Japanese Ministry of Defense stated that the transfer of the water is \u201c an emergency interim measure due to the typhoon problem.\n\u201d Ginowan city officials reacted immediately .\nJust two hours after the discharge began , the Ginowan Sewage Facility Division took wastewater samples from a manhole in the Isa area , where MCAS Futenma \u2019 s wastewater meets the public system .\nThe sample showed the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.7 ppt of PFAS in the sewer water .\nThe Okinawans say they found 739 ppt .\nAlthough routine testing of PFAS in various media can detect 36 analytes , only the three above have been reported by the Okinawans .\nThe Marines simply reported \u201c 2.7 ppt of PFOS.\n\u201d It is likely the overall totals of all PFAS concentrations would be twice the 739 ppt if the other varieties of PFAS had been tested .\nThe Okinawa prefectural ( state ) and Ginowan municipal governments immediately lodged protests with the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the U.S. military unilaterally dumped the water even while they knew that discussions were proceeding between Japan and the United States on how to handle the contaminated water , \u201d Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki said later that day .\n.\nIt is instructive to compare the responses of the Ginowan City Council , The Okinawan prefecture , the Marine Corps Installations Pacific , Okinawa , and the government of Japan .\nOn September 8th , the Ginowan City Council adopted a resolution saying it was \u201d furious \u201d with the U.S. military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe city had previously asked the Marines not to dump the poisons into the sanitary sewer system .\nThe resolution called on the U.S. military to switch to firefighting foams that do not contain PFAS and demanded the U.S. military incinerate the materials .\nThe city \u2019 s resolution said the release of chemicals \u201c shows a complete disregard for the people of this city.\n\u201d Ginowan Mayor Masanori Matsugawa said , \u201c It is extremely regrettable because the release of the water lacked any consideration for local residents who still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year \u2019 s incident .\nOkinawa \u2019 s Governor , Denny Tamaki says he wants access to the Futenma base to conduct independent testing .\nThe U.S. military responded to the city council \u2019 s resolution the next day by circulating a misleading press release with the following headline : The text of the military propaganda piece says the Marine Corps has \u201c completed the removal of all legacy Aqueous Film Forming Foam ( AFFF ) from Marine Corps camps and installations on Okinawa.\n\u201d The Marines explained that the foams containing PFOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan to be incinerated .\nThe foams have been replaced \u201c with a new foam which meets Department of Defense requirements and which still provides the same life-saving benefits in the event of a fire .\nThis action significantly reduces the environmental risk posed by PFOS and PFOA on Okinawa and is another concrete demonstration of MCIPAC \u2019 s transparency and its strong commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\u201d The DOD removed firefighting foams containing PFOS and PFOA from its U.S. bases several years ago while they \u2019 re only doing so now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new PFAS foams likely include the PFHxS found in Okinawa \u2019 s water , are also toxic .\nThe DOD refuses to disclose exactly what PFAS chemicals are present in its firefighting foams , because \u201c the chemicals are the proprietary information of the manufacturer.\n\u201d PFHxS is known to induce neuronal cell death and has been associated with early onset menopause and with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children .\nThe Okinawans are outraged ; the Marines are lying , while the Japanese government is complacent .\nYoshihide Suga , Prime Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out a thorough investigation of the incident .\nHe said the government of Japan is urging U.S. forces to replace firefighting foams containing PFOS .\nNothing more .\nTo recap , the Americans reported 2.7 ppt of PFAS in the sewage effluent while the Okinawans found 274 times that amount in the sewer water .\nThe Okinawans are caught between a rock and a hard place .\nStars and Stripes reported on September 20th that the Japanese government has agreed to take over \u201c disposal \u201d of Futenma \u2019 s contaminated wastewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 825,000 to incinerate the materials .\nThe U.S. military escapes justice .\nIncineration is not a step forward !\nThe Japanese government and Okinawan officials are apparently unaware of the dangers inherent in incinerating PFAS .\nThere is no scientific evidence that incineration destroys the deadly chemicals in the firefighting foam .\nMost incinerators are incapable of reaching the temperatures necessary to destroy the fluorine-carbon bond characteristic of PFAS .\nThese are , after all , firefighting foams .\nThe EPA says it \u2019 s not sure if PFAS is destroyed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compounds exceed the temperatures reached by almost all incinerators .\nOn September 22nd the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act that establishes a moratorium on the incineration of PFAS .\nThe measure will be voted on by the Senate as it considers the massive funding package .\nGovernor Tamaki , you \u2019 ve been great on this !\nPlease correct the record .\nThe incinerators will sprinkle a silent death over Japanese homes and farms .\nProtesters in Okinawa play a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states , the mainstream press seriously reports their message .\nThey

\u2019 s announcement of the U.S.\u2013Australia nuclear-powered submarine deal is the fact that the U.S. government plans to build new U.S. military bases Down Under .\nIn a September 16 press conference , Australia Defence Minister Peter Dutton announced plans to establish new facilities for naval , air , and ground forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and capability for maintenance to support our enhanced activities , including\u2026for our submarines and surface combatants \u201d and \u201c rotational deployments of all types of U.S. military aircraft to Australia.\n\u201d The U.S. military already has at least seven installations in Australia .\nWhile mainstream media outlets frequently raise fears of China \u2019 s \u201c escalating military presence in the South China Sea , \u201d the U.S. military has hundreds of bases throughout the Asia Pacific region , surrounding China \u2019 s borders .\nWorldwide , despite the recent withdrawal from Afghanistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military bases abroad in 80 foreign countries and colonies , according to a new , exhaustive list of U.S. overseas military installations that I helped compile for the Quincy Institute and World BEYOND War .\nThat the Biden administration intends to expand the already massive collection of bases in Australia and elsewhere in the Pacific is deeply troubling .\nAcross the political spectrum and even within the U.S. military there is growing recognition that the country has , as retired four-star U.S. Air Force General Roger Brady put it simply , \u201c too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank analysts , scholars , politicians , and other observers conclude that many bases abroad should have closed decades ago and are undermining U.S. and global security .\n\u201c I think we have too much infrastructure overseas , \u201d said the highest-ranking officer in the U.S. military , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Mark Milley , in December 2020 .\nEarlier this year President Biden announced a Global Posture Review to examine and ensure the deployment of U.S. military forces around the world is \u201c appropriately aligned with our foreign policy and national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t announced the results of the review , a military buildup Down Under would be a dangerous step in the wrong direction when base closures , not base construction , are what \u2019 s needed .\nSince World War II , the United States has maintained hundreds upon hundreds of bases in foreign lands .\nMore than 75 years after that war \u2019 s end , there are still 119 base sites in both Germany and Japan , according to the Pentagon .\nLocated on every continent except Antarctica , U.S. bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America \u201d installations with tens of thousands of military personnel and family members to small surveillance facilities and drone airfields .\nFor decades most in the United States haven \u2019 t questioned the presence of these bases .\nToo many have assumed that if a base exists it must have a reason to be there .\nToo many have assumed that more bases mean more security .\nUnfortunately , the opposite has often been the case : more bases abroad has meant less security for the United States and the world .\nMaintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of tax dollars annually at a time when domestic infrastructure is crumbling , and trillions are urgently needed to respond to pandemics , global warming , and other pressing health , education , housing , and environmental needs .\nI conservatively estimate the annual cost of building , operating , and maintaining bases abroad at $ 55 billion \u2014 larger than the State Department \u2019 s entire budget .\nBases are the face of the United States globally far more than diplomats , reflecting the dangerous , longstanding militarization of foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times the number ( 276 ) of U.S. embassies , consulates , and missions worldwide .\nWhile a few other countries maintain foreign bases on other nations \u2019 lands , the United States controls the vast majority .\nThe United Kingdom , France , Russia , Turkey , and a few other countries likely have around 200 foreign bases combined .\nChina has five foreign installations ( plus bases in Tibet ) .\nBases abroad also raise geopolitical and military tensions , encouraging countries like China , Russia , Iran , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending ( and foreign base construction ) when encircled by U.S. bases .\nHow would U.S. leaders respond if China or Russia were to build a single base near a U.S. border ?\nAs our new QI report and bases list show , U.S. installations are blocking the spread of democracy in at least 38 non-democratic countries and colonies .\nBases in the U.S. colonies ( \u201c territories \u201d ) of Puerto Rico , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands , American Samoa , and the U.S. Virgin Islands have helped perpetuate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States .\nBases abroad frequently cause significant environmental damage , harming and angering locals .\nDeadly accidents and crimes by U.S. military personnel , including rapes and murders , coupled with occupying other people \u2019 s lands also contribute to generating understandable protestand damaging the reputation of the United States .\nWhile the vast majority of protest is nonviolent , one of Osama bin Laden \u2019 s justifications for al Qaeda \u2019 s 9/11 attacks was the U.S. military presence in the Muslim holy land of Saudi Arabia .\nSome will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases overseas to keep the peace and make the United States and the world safer by deterring enemies .\nTo that I say : Prove it .\nThey can \u2019 t .\nThere is no conclusive evidence showing that U.S. bases overseas are an effective and strategically useful deterrent .\nMeanwhile , the last 20 years of endless war show how foreign bases have made it easier for U.S. leaders to launch and wage disastrous wars of aggression , like those in Afghanistan , Iraq , Yemen , Somalia , Libya , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deployed into combat .\nThe Biden administration can still reverse course to close bases abroad and abandon plans to build new ones in places like Australia .\nPresidents George H.W .\nBush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush closed hundreds of unnecessary bases in Europe and Asia in the 1990s and 2000s .\nCongress doesn \u2019 t need to be involved in overseas closures given the absence of a Base Realignment and Closure ( BRAC ) process abroad ; however , members should support closing installations overseas to return thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their paychecks \u2014 to their districts and states .\nThere is

Japan \u2019 s firebombed cities during World War II .\nInformed by interviews conducted by the United States Strategic Bombing Survey with Japanese citizens immediately after surrender , this analysis establishes a new vantage point from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final months of the war .\nBetween February 1944 and August 1945 more than ten million Japanese citizens , one-seventh of the total population of Japan \u2019 s home islands , evacuated from the country \u2019 s cities .\nThe population in rural Japan as a result rose from 42 million to 52.5 million in that timeframe.2 Tokyo alone declined from 6.8 million to 2.8 million .\nSuch a large-scale exodus across the country affected all levels of Japanese society.3 Primarily via an analysis of the testimonies of civilian evacuees from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , this article suggests that this wide-scale disruption of the urban population merits greater attention than it has received.4 In the fall of 1945 , the United States Strategic Bombing Survey ( USSBS ) surveyed several thousand evacuees in 57 cities .\nThe first-hand accounts of evacuees detail the complicated reality of the wartime civilian experience , one shaped by ever-changing civil defense policies , air raids and their aftermath , and government efforts to shape refugees \u2019 perceptions of the war through its policies and propaganda .\nThe accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives during the war : anxieties over the impact of air raids ; the logistics of evacuating ; negative social situations in the rural areas to which they evacuated ; and a lack of food , shelter , clothing , and medical supplies.5 Examined collectively , the accounts and other related sources also suggest that wartime evacuees became a source of potential societal unrest .\nThe Morale Division of the USSBS described Japanese wartime evacuees in this way : \u201c not only was their own morale affected by their experiences , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of \u2018 dangerous thoughts \u2019 with which to infect their hosts.\n\u201d 6 As evidenced by the postwar USSBS interviews , most evacuation in Japan occurred \u201c outside the state \u2019 s disaster planning.\n\u201d 7 While it is possible to detail some commonalities among many evacuees , reasons for leaving , experiences , and interpretations of events by the evacuees varied wildly .\nIn spite of this , the incredible degree of government incompetence in dealing with evacuees is a testament to the increasingly desperate state of Japanese society in the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , were told to flee for their lives and then penalized for evacuating .\nThey were forced from their homes in order to create firebreaks in anticipation of air raids , yet given nowhere to which to evacuate .\nThey were lauded by the media for their patriotism and then berated by their hosts in the rural villages for being traitors .\nThese contradictions led many evacuees to give voice to experiences \u2013 which the government sought to dismiss as rumors \u2013 that directly contradicted the official narrative on their situation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise that many citizens came to their own conclusions about the actual state of the war and that evacuees turned into a potential force for unrest throughout the country\u2014functioning , in the very least , as alternatives to Japan \u2019 s state-controlled news outlets .\nAs one 17-year-old aviator from Yokosuka put it immediately after the war , \u201c The radios and newspapers never reported [ anything ] accurately .\nThey said [ damage ] was [ \u2018 minor \u2019 ] when it was considerable .\nI knew this because I heard so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 It wasn \u2019 t until September 1943 that the government first acknowledged urban evacuation as a possible course of action .\nThat December the Japanese Cabinet enacted its \u201c Outline for Carrying out Urban Evacuation \u201d ( toshi sokai jisshi y\u014dk\u014d ) , which encouraged the evacuation of all people nonessential to industrial work.9 Suggestive of the significance of this policy reversal of course was the fact that these laws clashed with wartime regulations that \u201c gave the state powerful legal weapons against those residents who fled their neighborhoods without permission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prison with heavy labor or a maximum fine of 1,000 yen.\n\u201d 10 The campaign of \u201c de-housing \u201d or \u201c structure evacuation \u201d ( tatemono sokai ) , in which homes were destroyed en masse to create firebreaks in major cities , began in January 1944 and likewise reveals a lack of effective implementation of civil defense policies .\nCitizens who lived in houses near public transit lines and areas in which firebreaks were planned often had no more than a week to vacate their properties .\nAs a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses ( one-fifth of all housing destroyed over the course of the war ) were demolished , forcefully evacuating more than 3.5 million people , many of whom were not provided alternative accommodations.11 This defensive measure destroyed not just houses but the morale of many Japanese citizens .\nOne evacuee , for example , in a letter to the editor of the Asahi Shimbun in the wake of Japan \u2019 s surrender , remembered that all the structures , including her own , had been destroyed to create firebreaks for 200 meters surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c We were suddenly told , \u201d she recalled , \u201c that a week later our house would be demolished by the military\u2026 .\nI was caring for a three-and-a-half-year-old child and a fourteen-month-old infant while my husband was away.\n\u201d A series of tragic mishaps followed , and she lost all of her belongings as well as her home .\nShe concluded : \u201c Ordinary people were defeated by those on our own side rather than by the enemy .\nIn order to protect the prime minister \u2019 s residence , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A teacher who evacuated from Tokyo to Shiga Prefecture received \u201c no help whatsoever \u201d from the government in moving and became \u201c totally sick of war \u201d after having his family forcefully separated by de-housing .\nAnd a worker at a war plant who also evacuated to Shiga prefecture said of his own de-housing experience : \u201c I was very much against evacuating , but what could I do against an order ?\n\u201d 13 The campaign of \u201c de-housing \u201d added to evacuees \u2019 growing doubts about the government \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to the large scale firebombing beginning in March 1945 , government strategy for dealing with air raids involved four categories : \u201c factory dispersal , creating firebreaks [ de-housing ] , strengthening air defense activities in the neighborhoods , and evacuating as many people as possible to the countryside.\n\u201d 14 Evacuation measures tended to be encouraged rather than compulsory .\nThis changed following the loss of the Mariana Islands , when in June 1944 the government published its \u201c Outline for Encouraging the Evacuation of Schoolchildren , \u201d the only compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By March 1945 , 446,200 urban schoolchildren ( first through sixth grade ) were evacuated with their classmates and teachers to the countryside .\nAnother 800,000 were sent to live with relatives .\nOne village in Nagano prefecture , for example , had a prewar population of 6,500 .\nIt was pushed to its limits when it received over 4,300 schoolchildren from various wards in Tokyo , and the memoirs of evacuated schoolchildren sent to Nagano reveal the large number of evacuating students , the lack of food and supplies , and resourcefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuees not only encountered , but seemingly compounded , the widespread material shortages affecting most of Japan in 1945.17 Some rural districts , already lacking sufficient housing , food , and the manpower necessary to accommodate their suddenly expanding populations , found a convenient scapegoat in the untimely arrival of evacuating citizens .\nDaily life was heavily regimented for the schoolchildren in a fashion reminiscent of strict military training .\nChildren woke at 5:30 A.M. and had their day strictly controlled until 8:00 P.M. , with the largest segments of the day devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 The written experiences of these evacuated schoolchildren emphasized homesickness , bullying , tensions between evacuee children and their hosts , agricultural work , and hunger above all else.19 One child remembered : \u201c All we thought about was eating ; all we talked about was what we ate in the past.\n\u201d 20 These harsh conditions often led to dark circumstances , including instances of sexual assault and attempted suicide .\nAnd near the end of the war , teachers , directed by the state , had children rehearse mass suicide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evacuee as Agent of Social Unrest In the last year of the war , while the government strongly encouraged evacuation of the general public engaged in nonessential activities , it provided little financial assistance .\nOne housewife who fled to Fukuoka prefecture noted : I footed all the expenses myself .\nI had heard that the government would give us a subsidy , but it was so uncertain as to when we would receive it , and since we couldn \u2019 t wait , I took care of everything myself .\nI spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe could not wait for ordinary means , so I paid everything according to black market prices .\nFinally , six months later , I received 200 yen from the government.\n\u201d 22 Another , a bank clerk from Kobe , received compensation for her travel but , like most evacuees , received no help upon arriving in the countryside .\n\u201c The government paid our train fare and took care of our baggage .\nThey made no arrangement for our living here.\n\u201d 23 Tokyo station immediately after the war .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , National Archives at College Park , Maryland , Microfilm Locator M1655 , Roll 138 .\nWhile some evacuation did occur prior to the Great Tokyo Air Raid of March 9-10 , 1945\u2014including the mandatory evacuation of elementary school children\u2014the first major firebombing of Japan \u2019 s capital both increased the impetus to evacuate for the general populace and highlighted the disarray of official civil defense measures .\nAs one official at the Police Affairs Bureau of the Home Ministry reflected , after the March 9-10 air raid on Tokyo \u201c the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural conclusion reached by the people too\u2014that all raid preparations were hopeless and it was best to avoid injury and death by fleeing.\n\u201d 24 Immediately after the first major firebombing of Tokyo , an emergency cabinet meeting concluded with the bleak official pronouncement that \u201c every city must manage for itself.\n\u201d 25 Official policy regarding evacuation from cities remained haphazard .\nPoet and novelist It\u014d Sei wrote in his diary in May 1945 that : \u201c Until a few days ago I nearly decided to evacuate\u2026then , in yesterday \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision to evacuation guidelines .\nIt said we were no longer permitted to evacuate.\n\u201d 26 In a postwar letter to the editor of the Asahi Shimbun , one evacuated woman remembered that she \u201c devotedly believed in the country and the news \u201d until her husband was sent away after the March 9-10 air raid on Tokyo destroyed his company \u2019 s building .\nThat same evening , she was notified that her house was to be immediately demolished .\nThe next morning a tank came and pulled down her house .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ war grew worse , \u201d she wrote .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing as miserable as the cruelty of war .\nIt robbed me of my husband .\nIt robbed me of my home .\nIn a single moment I lost what little happiness I had left.\n\u201d 27 In the absence of an effective or cohesive government approach to fire defense , the Japanese government transferred the burden of civil defense to ward authorities , who then handed off those responsibilities to neighborhood associations and local groups.28 These local authorities\u2014contradicting limited government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpatriotic late into 1945 when air raids had greatly intensified.29 Even as the state began to reverse course and encourage evacuation in the wake of the March 9-10 firebombing of Tokyo , some local associations maintained intense pressure on their citizens\u2014especially those who attempted to flee .\nThe denial of food rations to evacuees was one of the most effective measures the neighborhood associations employed .\nIn response to leaflets rained down from B-29s announcing an imminent attack on the city of Aomori , residents fled en masse , only to be coerced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant them food rations until they did .\n( After most returned , Aomori was heavily bombed . )\n30 One evacuee\u2014a baker who fled early in January 1944\u2014remembered being treated like a deserter by the police in the countryside , who said to him \u201c Are you Japanese or not ?\n\u201d Evacuees were jeered by locals as \u201c traitors \u201d and \u201c hangers-on \u201d for even the slightest of offenses.31 One spoke about the tenuous connection with rural hosts : Relations between the evacuees and the natives of the area to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong the evacuees and sufferers from damage and the people who have not suffered\u2026 there is great discrimination.\n\u201d 32 Ignoring increasing friction between evacuees and rural citizens in the countryside , the Japanese government issued propaganda claiming that mass evacuation was part of its plans .\nA March 1945 article in the Nippon Times , for instance , discussed government mobilization of evacuees to the countryside for the purpose of \u201c convert [ ing ] the entire nation into a veritable fortress against which the invader will be smashed to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception of a few government measures beginning in mid-1945 such as specialized trains for evacuees , inconsistent federal assistance with relocation costs , and , above all , mandatory student relocation ( gakud\u014d sokai ) \u2014was that most wartime evacuation took place spontaneously and independent of the government.33 That is not to say that the state had not been attempting to integrate evacuation into official narratives since earlier in the war .\nIn December 1943 , for example , the Cabinet Board of Information officially defined evacuation as follows : Urban evacuation does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , but rather that every citizen must take an active part in the war effort and that the evacuation must be made an element which strengthens our fighting power .\nEvacuation is not just a flight from the cities but is a positive contribution toward strengthening our fighting power.\n\u201d 34 Newspapers portrayed evacuees as fleeing not of their own accord ( and certainly not because Japan was losing the war ) , but in accord with government directives to aid wartime production .\nEven after the March 9-10 air raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaringly irreconcilable with state narratives , newspaper articles detailed elaborate , government initiatives to put evacuees to work producing food in the countryside.35 Others offered the evacuees as examplars of the Yamato Spirit : The victims of the raids who have lost their homes and material belongings , instead of bemoaning their losses , invariably feel the stronger and freer to devote their services to the nation for having been relieved of the encumbrances and responsibilities engendered by material possessions .\n\u2026 .\nThey discover an extraordinary elation in being able now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State.36 References to well-known people peppered such propaganda to lend it credibility .\nA June 1945 article titled \u201c Well-Known Figures to Take up Rural Duties : Evacuees from Metropolis Shoulder the Hoe , Turn Efforts Towards Self Sufficiency \u201d consisted simply of a long list of notable politicians and businessmen who had evacuated.37 Often such lists were accompanied by testimonies from readily recognized figures .\nFormer ambassador to the United States , Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo , for example , whose house was destroyed by incendiaries , commented : The greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere spirit of work\u2014a spirit that can be fostered only by living in the country in close contact with Mother Nature .\nThe true strength of Japan lies in that spirit , the spirit that will prevail in the end and assure final victory.\n\u201d 38 Cracks , however , appeared in the government \u2019 s propaganda campaign of appropriating evacuees into its narrative of certain victory.39 As city after city burned , discussion of evacuees became accusatory .\nOne article bemoaned a \u201c dark side \u201d of the situation by describing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for their \u201c simplicity and sincerity.\n\u201d 40 The challenge of newcomers was compounded by nation-wide shortages of food and commodities .\nOne rikshaw driver in Akita city remembered immediately after the war , for example , that \u201c when the evacuees came , the food problems worsened .\nBefore the evacuees came , Akita was already short of commodities , so\u2026they made the situation worse.\n\u201d 41 Even the Vice-Chief of the Cabinet Information Bureau in Tokyo reported in October of 1945 that \u201c farm produce prices soared due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unsurprisingly , evacuees found life in the countryside extremely difficult .\nSome evacuated families were forced to return to their ruined cities after abortive attempts to join distant relatives or find a place in the countryside .\nTo others it increasingly appeared that they were not welcome anywhere .\nThe evacuees \u2019 presence , in fact directly contradicted the government \u2019 s propaganda : The abandoning of the cities heralded Japan \u2019 s imminent defeat .\nOne mechanic from a rural village summarized the view of many : \u201c Before the evacuees came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and had a chance of winning [ the war ] , but when the evacuees came I realized that we were losing the war.\n\u201d 43 Others , such as a 34-year-old school teacher in Wakayama , saw a direct correlation between the arrival of evacuees and their fear of air raids : \u201c Before the evacuees came I didn \u2019 t think about the war so much , but after they came\u2026I became afraid of the air raids.\n\u201d 44 A 56-year-old farmer in Akita prefecture explained the transformation simply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war at all before the evacuees came.\n\u201d 45 Imminent defeat was perhaps more obvious to the evacuees than to the rest of the population .\nBy the spring of 1945 most able-bodied men were deployed overseas ; the Japanese home front was overwhelmed by American airpower ; and its vital imports severely curtailed by both aerial mining operations and naval blockades.46 Though the exact number of casualties remains difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to precisely calculate , the air raids on over 60 Japanese cities , combined with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese citizens and rendered over a million homeless.47 Central to the government \u2019 s response was its attempt to mobilize and control Japan \u2019 s remaining manpower\u2014primarily women , the elderly , and children.48 In the face of emphasis on control , as shown by Special Higher Police documents , reports of \u201c anti-war \u201d gossip and rumor-mongering increased dramatically near the end of the war , causing the Home Ministry to condemn the \u201c hateful , unpatriotic act \u201d of disseminating rumors as antithetical to victory.49 Simultaneously , air raid defense measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters , air raid drills , and even \u201c air defense \u201d songs and board games attempted to normalize civil defense in the lives of civilians as the war situation deteriorated.50 In mid-1945 the cabinet\u2014facing the prospect of an impending Allied invasion\u2014even organized and trained women and children to fight off invaders with bamboo spears as \u201c home-front equivalents to the Kamikaze pilots.\n\u201d 51 Consequently , the futility of air raid defense and preparations became increasingly obvious to many .\nAs one 25-year-old evacuee from Sendai recalled immediately after the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set up cisterns of water , built fire breaks , and had air raid drills\u2026I thought it was only a matter of [ maintaining ] outward appearance.\n\u201d 52 The idea of fighting off an Allied invasion with nothing but bamboo spears , in the face of incredible destruction was met with derision .\nOne 64-year-old farmer from Shimonoseki , for example , recalled receiving \u201c a command to drill with bamboo spears \u201d in April of 1945 and although \u201c everybody began to participate in the drills , I considered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare.\n\u201d 53 An evacuee in Kure called the whole exercise \u201c useless , \u201d and a 29-year-old clerk in the Finance Ministry\u2014who recalled hearing rumors directly from evacuees\u2014recalled : As the war progressed , even some soldiers were unable to get their guns and other war equipment .\nWe , too , drilled for the approaching battle for the homeland with bamboo spears .\n.\n.How can a man fight a mechanized army with bamboo spears ?\nWe were deceived by the army leaders who constantly told the people that Japan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With their firsthand experiences , the main culprits for the increased spreading of rumors , according to wartime reports by the Domei News Agency , were the evacuees themselves.55 The agency categorized rumors spread by evacuees into several categories , such as \u201c scope of damage , \u201d \u201c neighborhood associations , \u201d \u201c espionage activities , \u201d \u201c economic conspiracies , \u201d and \u201c disposal of the dead \u201d ( among others ) .\nFor example : \u2022 \u201c When the alert sounds\u2026most people flee to the mountains instead of taking refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2022 \u201c Many student workers in Nagoya are dead .\nAlthough they attempted to seek cover , they were ordered to stay at their posts to guard the factory .\nBecause of that they died.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c The enemy bombings are accurate .\nMight there not be some spies among the Japanese ?\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c Since Osaka is the black-market center , the enemy is attempting to foster it in order to undermine economic life .\nConsequently , the enemy employs discretion in his bombings against the city.\n\u201d 56 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immaterial , however , when compared to the fact that evacuees were evidently vehicles for communication , information ( accurate or not ) , and wartime anxiety for home front citizens .\nThis uncontrolled spread of information heightened government concerns about evacuees .\nCitizens living in tin huts in a bombed-out area .\nUnited States Strategic Bombing Survey Morale Division , National Archives at College Park , Maryland , Microfilm Locator M1655 , Roll 138 .\nWhile the range and variety of rumors was extensive , a prevalent theme involved criticizing the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trouble \u201c enjoying all the luxuries of living \u201d while \u201c hardships increased \u201d for people like them.57 The government \u2019 s drives to track and curtail so-called subversive behavior reveal a legitimate fear of societal unrest emerging from the millions of evacuees across the country.58 This demarcates a pivotal moment in which the state \u2019 s view of evacuees \u2013 and that of elite circles \u2013 shifted .\nKido K\u014dichi , one of the closest advisors to emperor Hirohito , noted that \u201c conditions inside the country were indeed \u2018 quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were even signs of anti-militar [ y ] sentiment.\n\u201d 59 In one of the most powerful statements acknowledging the significance of social unrest among the people , former Prime Minister Yonai Mitsumasa noted : I think the term is perhaps inappropriate , but the atomic bombs and the Soviet entry into the war are , in a sense , gifts from the gods [ tenyu \u2018 heaven sent blessings \u2019 ] .\nThis way we don \u2019 t have to say that we surrendered because of domestic circumstances .\nI long held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enemy attack nor because of the atomic bombs and the Soviet entry into the war .\nMy main anxiety is over the domestic situation.60 While a number of factors led to Japan \u2019 s decision to surrender , it is clear that fear of internal social upheaval was a considerable concern for officials .\nMillions of evacuees constituted a central aspect of such unrest .\nThe evacuees\u2014as a community\u2014present an important picture of the devastating impact of the war , the challenges to the cohesiveness of the Japanese social order , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the shifting of public opinion as the war progressed .\nAs such , greater attention to

get a rounded view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u2019 s visit to the United States and his meeting with President Biden .\nSo much has changed since Modi last visited America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , America has changed and the world has changed .\nModi himself has had a makeover .\nThis is not the boisterous politician we saw who electrified the Madison Square Garden or went on a victory lap with Trump at Houston .\nIt has been a sobering two years .\nIndia \u2019 s economy crashed and it can not be the magnet anymore for investors in Silicon Valley .\n\u2018 Make in India \u2019 withered away .\nThe current pitch for a spot in the global supply chain is unconvincing .\nIndians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the pandemic .\nThe emblematic images of the castaway corpses on the banks of the Ganges tarnished the Indian narrative .\nAmerica too witnessed cataclysmic events that shook the very foundations of its democratic superstructure and exposed the deep cracks in its society and polity .\nThere is extreme polarisation .\nThe trajectory of transition remains uncertain and might even return back to Trump by 2024 or someone of his ilk .\nMeanwhile , the world situation has transformed phenomenally .\nThe overall trends accelerated thanks to the pandemic \u2014 principally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , America \u2019 s decline as world hegemon and the consequent shift in the world order .\nThe \u2018 unipolar moment \u2019 has become a footnote in current history and there is an extremely high degree of volatility in the international system due to the US \u2019 reluctance to concede the inexorable shift in the global power dynamic .\nIt is against such a dramatic backdrop that Modi \u2019 s return to the US after an epochal gap of two years needs to be assessed .\nThis has been a challenging visit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the way Biden sized him up .\nBiden is a far more experienced statesman than Modi , and his diplomatic track record is manifold Modi \u2019 s \u2014nearly half a century old .\nWhat made this occasion particularly challenging was that there was no scope for \u201c hug diplomacy.\n\u201d Aside the photo-ups , you could entrap the victim in a tight ring of bonhomie and mellow him somewhat before sitting down to hard talk .\nBut coronavirus disallows wanton \u201c huggery \u201d .\nWhich meant , diplomacy had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , exchange of views , explanations and discussions , consensus-making and so on .\nThe spin doctors in the Indian establishment claim that Modi-Biden \u2018 bilateral \u2019 lasted for 90 minutes ( which was , by the way , the exact duration of Biden \u2019 s phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jining on September 9 . )\nBut Biden is at a point in his chequered political career where he will roll up sleeves and get down to the nitty-gritty with only two world leaders \u2014 Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age ( 79 ) .\nModi possibly couldn \u2019 t have had talking points to engage Biden \u2019 s attention span for 90 minutes .\nThere \u2019 s hardly anything happening in the US-Indian relationship .\nAccording to RT , Biden expressly advised Modi against answering questions from American media , which he noted wryly , is not as cooperative and well-behaved as the Indian media .\nTherefore , all we \u2019 re left with is the document on the White House website titled U.S.-India Joint Leaders \u2019 Statement : A Partnership for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint statement nor the stuff of media briefing , but more of a declaratory nature of the sort that world leaders resort to for projecting their \u201c visionary \u201d outlook when they have little to announce as concrete outcome of their parleys .\nSo , we get more of the same \u2014 Covid-19 , public health , vaccine , climate change , UN reform , NSG , cyber security , space , etc .\nThe only point where Biden appears to have bestirred himself to say something was in regard of US-Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of the defence relationship\u2026 and the unwavering commitment to India as a Major Defense Partner through close defence engagements in information sharing , sharing of logistics and military-to-military interactions , strengthening cooperation in advanced military technologies , and expanding engagements in a multilateral framework including with regional partners.\n\u201d The reference to \u201c expanding engagements in a multilateral framework \u201d is worrisome .\nBiden can spring nasty surprises .\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron would know .\nThe salience of the Joint Leaders \u2019 Statement is , of course , that the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cart apropos the Taliban government .\nIt goes to the credit of Secretary of State Blinken that so soon after leaving Delhi in the lurch to write off its $ 3 billion investments in Afghanistan , he got EAM Jaishankar to sheepishly get back into the American cart .\nBasically , the two foreign ministers are desperately in need of each other \u2019 s company , facing stark isolation in the region .\nBut this Afghan journey is risky and can land India in an even bigger mess , once the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destabilise Afghanistan \u2019 s neighbouring regions .\nConsumed with a zero-sum mindset via-a-vis Pakistan and China , Modi Govt has lost a sense of direction .\nStrangely , the Joint Statement has ignored the \u201c value-based \u201d India-US relationship .\nIt says nothing about shared values or about India \u2019 s flourishing democracy .\nThis is astounding , as Biden is world champion on human rights and democracy and should have had some nice words for Modi \u2019 s stewardship .\nBut then , the Indian media quoted Biden as underlining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c a shared responsibility to uphold democratic values \u201d and the two countries \u2019 \u201c joint commitment to diversity.\n\u201d Biden went on to recall that next week marks Gandhiji \u2019 s birth anniversary .\nHe underscored to Modi that the message of \u201c non-violence , respect , tolerance matters today maybe more than ever.\n\u201d Biden made sure the Indian audience would appreciate his empathy .\nThese remarks came after Vice-President Kamala Harris had spoken to Modi in public about the importance of democracy when she said , \u201c it is imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within our respective countries.\n\u201d To be sure , this visit to the US has ended on a vastly different note in comparison with Modi \u2019 s previous visits during the two US administrations of presidents Barack Obama and Trump .\nCall it a rebuke , call it a censure , call it a distancing from Modi , the sharp message would have gone home .\nThe great irony is that all this while , the democratic values were supposed to be the cementing factor in the India-US relationship \u2014 and more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , the raison d \u2019 \u00eatre of the QUAD itself .\nModi government wouldn \u2019 t have bargained that the Sword of Democracy is double-edged and can also come to haunt those who preach it cavalierly without themselves practising it .\nNote to readers : Please click the share

and follow us on Instagram at @ crg_globalresearch .\nThe US and its allies continue beating the drums of war in regards to China , but how serious is this ?\nWill it really lead to war , or is it merely posturing meant to give the US the most favorable position on the other side of a fully ascendant China ?\nA critical inflection point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approaching , where China \u2019 s economic and military might will irreversibly surpass the US and the center of global power will likewise irreversibly shift from West to East creating a global balance of power unseen for centuries .\nA closing window of opportunity estimated to close between 2025 and 2030 allows the US to carry out a limited war with China , resulting in a favorable outcome for Washington .\nBeyond that , the US will find itself outmatched and any attempt to curb China \u2019 s rise rendered futile .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself this propaganda aims to justify and rally support for , is unmistakable , particularly for those who have witnessed similar buildups ahead of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , or US-led military interventions in nations like Libya and Syria from 2011 onward .\nA recent 60 Minutes Australia segment titled , \u201c War with China : Are we closer than we think ?\n, \u201d presented an amalgamation of this ongoing propaganda used to vilify the Chinese government , dehumanize the Chinese people , and create sufficient anger , fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hearts and minds across the planet to justify what would be for the 21st century , an unprecedented war .\nFor the United States , a war with China would be the first of its kind , a war with a peer or near-peer competitor armed with nuclear weapons .\nYet US war planners are fairly confident that the conflict could be confined to East Asia , remain conventional , and see a favorable outcome for the US that would secure its primacy over Asia for decades to come .\nA victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature , but rather hinge on \u201c nonmilitary factors , \u201d and focus on disrupting and setting back China \u2019 s economy and thus the power propelling China past the United States at the moment .\nThe 2016 US War Plan Coming to Life These conclusions were laid out in a 2016 RAND Corporation document titled , \u201c War with China : Thinking Through the Unthinkable , \u201d commissioned by the Office of the Undersecretary of the Army and carried out by the RAND Arroyo Center \u2019 s Strategy , Doctrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the RAND Arroyo Center is part of the RAND Corporation and is a federally-funded research and development center sponsored by the United States Army .\nThe report notes that America \u2019 s military advantage is in decline vis-a-vis China , but also lays out several current realities that would favor the US should hostilities unfold .\nIt states on page 9 of the PDF document : We postulate that a war would be regional and conventional .\nIt would be waged mainly by ships on and beneath the sea , by aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space ( against satellites ) and cyberspace ( against computer systems ) .\nWe assume that fighting would start and remain in East Asia , where potential Sino-USflash points and nearly all Chinese forces are located .\nThe RAND document admits that China \u2019 s forces are concentrated in Chinese territory and that virtually all flash points that could trigger a conflict are likewise located in the region .\nThis implies that US forces would need to be more or less right up to China \u2019 s shores and regional claims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or intervene in matters between Taiwan and mainland China .\nMany assume any war between China and the United States would escalate into a nuclear exchange .\nHowever , this is unlikely except under the most extreme conditions .\nRegarding nuclear and conventional warfare , the RAND document makes a compelling argument , stating : It is unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used : Even in an intensely violent conventional conflict , neither side would regard its losses as so serious , its prospects so dire , or the stakes so vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating nuclear retaliation by using nuclear weapons first .\nWe also assume that China would not attack the US homeland , except via cyberspace , given its minimal capability to do so with conventional weapons .\nIn contrast , US nonnuclear attacks against military targets in China could be extensive .\nThe report studies a window of opportunity that began in 2015 and stretches to 2025 .\nCurrent developments seem to indicate the US may see this window extend as far as 2030 , including the recent announcement of the \u201c AUKUS \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coming online and ready to participate in such a conflict around the early 2030 \u2019 s .\nUS May Trade Heavy Military Losses for China \u2019 s Economic Ruination Under a section titled , \u201c The Importance of Nonmilitary Factors , \u201d the RAND report notes : The prospect of a military standoff means that war could eventually be decided by nonmilitary factors .\nThese should favor the United States now and in the future .\nAlthough war would harm both economies , damage to China \u2019 s could be catastrophic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25\u201335 percent reduction in Chinese gross domestic product ( GDP ) in a yearlong war , compared with a reduction in US GDP on the order of 5\u201310 percent .\nEven a mild conflict , unless ended promptly , could weaken China \u2019 s economy .\nA long and severe war could ravage China \u2019 s economy , stall its hard-earned development , and cause widespread hardship and dislocation .\nConsidering the current shape of US-Chinese relations , the emphasis on economics and trade , and the persistent , even desperate attempts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much damage on China \u2019 s economy ahead of a potential conflict as possible , but also its attempts to \u201c decouple \u201d from China \u2019 s economy as fast as possible could be interpreted as tying off a limb before amputation .\nThe report notes the follow-on effects of the economic damage such a conflict would inflict on China .\nIt would open the door for already on-going US machinations to undermine China \u2019 s social and political stability to expand and do tremendous damage , perhaps even threatening the cohesion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn aggravate political turmoil and embolden separatists in China .\nAlthough the regime and its security forces presumably could withstand such challenges , doing so might necessitate increased oppressiveness , tax the capacity , and undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese regime in the midst of a very difficult war .\nIn contrast , US domestic partisan skirmishing could handicap the war effort but not endanger societal stability , much less the survival of the state , no matter how long and harsh the conflict , so long as it remains conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , could worsen China \u2019 s economic problems and impede the government \u2019 s ability to control a restive population .\nThe mention of \u201c separatists in China \u201d is particularly important .\nThese groups , often made up of armed extremists , are supported by an extensive international network funded by the US government itself .\nSeparatism in China \u2019 s Xinjiang and Tibetan regions is openly supported by the US government and has been sponsored by Washington for decades .\nThe US National Endowment for Democracy \u2019 s official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China as , \u201c Xinjiang/East Turkestan , \u201d \u201c East Turkestan \u201d being the separatist name for Xinjiang .\nThe organizations listed , including the Uyghur Human Rights Project and the World Uyghur Congress openly admit on their respective websites that they view Xinjiang \u2013 contrary to international law \u2013 as \u201c occupied \u201d by China rather than a territory of China .\nIn a move that could very likely be a warning of just how close to a US-provoked conflict with China we may be , the US State Department de-listed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 claiming it had not been active for over a decade .\nYet by the US \u2019 own admission US military forces struck ETIM targets in Afghanistan as recently as 2018 , and just this year ETIM representatives gave an interview with US-based Newsweek magazine .\nETIM is still listed by a number of nations as well as the UN itself as a terrorist organization .\nEconomic turmoil , armed insurrection , and socio-political instability are factors the US has openly attempted to impose on China for decades and is still placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIf a conflict were to break out , those pieces would clearly already be in place to maximize Washington \u2019 s ability to exploit economic damage inflicted by the conflict .\nThe RAND paper notes specifically the impact on Chinese trade a conventional conflict confined to East Asia would have .\nThe report notes : \u2026while the United States has sophisticated sensors to distinguish military from nonmilitary targets , during war it will focus on finding and tracking the former ; moreover , Chinese ISR is less sophisticated and discriminating , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazardous airspace and sea space , perhaps ranging from the Yellow Sea to the South China Sea .\nAssuming that non-Chinese commercial enterprises would rather lose revenue than ships or planes , the United States would not need to use force to stop trade to and from China.16 China would lose a substantial amount of trade that would be required to transit the war zone .\nThe United States expressly threatening commercial shipping would be provocative , hazardous , and largely unnecessary .\nSo we posit no US blockade , as such .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of tools at its disposal that it regularly uses upon the international stage to impede free commerce .\nIt is an irony since Washington often accuses Beijing of \u201c threatening \u201d such commerce in regions like the South China Sea while Washington is actually impeding it on a global scale .\nNPR in its 2020 article , \u201c US Seizes Iranian Fuel From 4 Tankers Bound For Venezuela , \u201d would note : According to The Associated Press , quoting unnamed USofficials , no military force was used in the seizure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships was physically impounded .\nInstead , US officials threatened ship owners , insurers and captains with sanctions to force them to hand over their cargo , the AP reported .\nBecause of America \u2019 s still formidable grip over international media , it would be extremely easy to sink vessels engaged in commerce and blame it on China or claim it was accidental .\nA total blockade would not be necessary to deter the majority of commerce in the region , only a few examples would be needed for the self-preservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade .\nAnother concerning warning sign was the Pentagon restructuring an entire branch of the US armed forces , the US Marine Corps , to specifically fight a single nation ( China ) , in a very specific region ( East Asia ) , with very specific tactics ( shutting down straits used for commercial shipping ) .\nDefense News in a 2020 article titled , \u201c Here \u2019 s the US Marine Corps \u2019 plan for sinking Chinese ships with drone missile launchers , \u201d would claim : The US Marine Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a new project in development is aimed at making their dreams of harrying the People \u2019 s Liberation Army Navy a reality .\nMarine Corps requirements and development chief Lt. Gen. Eric Smith told reporters last year during the Expeditionary Warfare Conference that the Marines want to fight on ground of their choosing and then maneuver before forces can concentrate against them .\n\u201c They are mobile and small , they are not looking to grab a piece of ground and sit on it , \u201d Smith said of his Marine units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block a strait permanently .\nI \u2019 m looking to maneuver .\nThe German concept is \u2018 Schwerpunkt , \u2019 which is applying the appropriate amount of pressure and force at the time and place of your choosing to get maximum effect.\n\u201d The US Marine Corps has already decommissioned all of their main battle tanks as part of this restructuring which took less than a year \u2013 signifying the urgency of US preparations .\nThe US taking ships out in busy commerce straits and creating an environment that would cripple trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world would have a heavy impact on China \u2019 s economy .\nOn page 67 of the PDF document , RAND includes a graphic depiction of China \u2019 s projected GDP losses versus the US , giving us a compelling motive for the US to wage a war it knows it will suffer heavy military losses amidst , but emerge economically stronger than a China that will otherwise , barring such a conflict , surpass the US within this window of opportunity .\nChina Knows , But Can China Beat the Clock ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) is an attempt for China to diversify away from Asia-Pacific trade routes the US is clearly making preparations to attack and disrupt .\nPipelines running through Pakistan as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) and through Myanmar to Kunming in Yunnan Province would help move hydrocarbons bound for China from the Middle East without passing through waters the US could disrupt in the conflict it is clearly preparing for .\nHowever , these alternative routes are already under attack .\nUS-sponsored separatists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baluchistan regularly attack and kill Chinese engineers and the infrastructure itself .\nJust this year alone , France 24 would report in April a bombing targeting a hotel the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan was staying at but who luckily wasn \u2019 t at the hotel at the time of the bombing .\nIn July , the BBC reported that 9 Chinese engineers working on CPEC projects were killed in a targeted attack .\nAnd according to Reuters , in August , 2 children were killed during a suicide bombing targeting Chinese engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attacking Chinese investments in Myanmar since the military ousted the US client regime headed by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy ( NDL ) .\nCNN would report in March , just a month after the military took over , that the opposition was lighting Chinese factories ablaze .\nUS government-funded Myanmar opposition media outlet , The Irrawaddy , published an article in May titled , \u201c Deadly Attack on Pipeline Station Spotlights China \u2019 s High Stakes in Myanmar , \u201d claiming : The importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials held an emergency meeting with Myanmar officials , at which they urged the military regime to tighten security measures for the pipelines .\nThey said the project is a crucial part of Beijing \u2019 s Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) in Myanmar and insisted that \u201c any damage to the pipelines would cause huge losses for both countries.\n\u201d The request came amid growing anti-China sentiment in Myanmar , where protesters\u2014angered by Beijing \u2019 s blocking of the UN Security Council ( UNSC ) \u2019 s efforts to take action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pipelines .\nIt would come as no surprise if attacks were carried out against , for instance , the pipelines , he said .\n\u201c And attitudes will not change unless the Chinese government stops its support for the Myanmar military .\nThat should be a real concern.\n\u201d Xinjiang , China , also serves as a critical juncture for China \u2019 s BRI and we can clearly see the US promoting separatism there .\nThe recent \u201c Uyghur Tribunal \u201d organized by the abovementioned US-funded World Uyghur Congress aims at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter US-sponsored armed separatism in Xinjiang by placing additional international pressure on China for implementing necessary security measures to prevent it .\nThe continued US-sponsored attacks on China \u2019 s BRI , the US-led military build-up along China \u2019 s coasts , and the propaganda war the US is waging to control the narratives surrounding both , represents a race against time for both Washington and Beijing .\nFor Washington , it is attempting to create the conditions in which RAND predictions of China \u2019 s economic devastation following a conventional conflict confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality .\nFor Beijing , it is attempting to run out the clock and assume the economic , military , and political power it needs to fully deter any such conflict , and assume its position as the largest , most powerful economy on Earth .\nAll things being equal , China has the world \u2019 s largest population \u2013 a population that is hardworking and well-educated .\nChina \u2019 s educational institutions are producing millions more science , technology , engineering , and mathematics graduates than the US per year .\nChina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy has plenty of resources .\nIt should become the largest economy .\nAnd only a war of aggression , chosen to be waged by Washington will stop this from coming to pass .\nUS foreign policy in the 21st century has demonstrated in action the true nature of its foreign policy versus what Washington \u2019 s politicians say with words from behind podiums or its media says in front of cameras about a \u201c rules-based international order.\n\u201d The only rule we can see demonstrably upheld is \u201c might makes right.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US \u201c makes right \u201d its smaller

in the back , and torn up a huge , underway deal for conventional French submarines .\nThe nuclear terrorist Australia , UK and US AUKUS Alliance threatens Australian security , sovereignty , coastal cities , and trade .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ) , China , Australia \u2019 s South Pacific and Asian neighbours , and Humanity .\nThe scrapping of the A $ 90 billion contract for supply of French submarines , the agreement for Australia to get US-designed nuclear-powered submarines , and the formation of the nuclear-armed Australia , UK and US ( AUKUS ) Alliance to dominate Asia and the Indo-Pacific , were all massive decisions made in secret without public consultation or political debate in the 3 countries involved .\nAppallingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into by the extreme right-wing , war criminal , climate criminal , egregiously corrupt , dangerously incompetent , traitorous and US lackey Coalition Australian Government for simple grubby political advantage in the forthcoming Federal elections .\nSummarized below are the numerous key aspects of this disastrous affair set out in 3 areas , namely ( A ) AUKUS nuclear terrorism , ( B ) Genocidal AUKUS militarism , and ( C ) AUKUS deal damages Australian values , sovereignty , independence , security , democracy , reputation , foreign relations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist AUKUS increases the existential threat to Australia , Humanity and the Biosphere from nuclear weapons .\nHumanity and the Biosphere are existentially threatened by nuclear weapons and climate change .\nA nuclear holocaust would be followed by a nuclear winter that would wipe out much of Humanity and the Biosphere .\nIn the absence of requisite climate action , a worsening Climate Genocide is predicted to kill 10 billion people en route to a sustainable population in 2100 of only 1 billion [ 1 ] .\nFamed theoretical physicist Professor Stephen Hawking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change \u201d [ 2 ] .\nAustralia \u2019 s nuclear submarine and AUKUS deals both seriously increase the existential threat of nuclear weapons to Humanity and the Biosphere .\nAs with its evil involvement in so many other areas relating to war crimes , human rights abuse and climate criminality , the extreme right-wing , anti-science and neoliberal Liberal Party-National Party Coalition Government of Australia is again instinctively doing the wrong thing by this long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat drawdown and total nuclear disarmament are technically possible and readily achievable with the \u201c small \u201d nuclear weapons states of the UK , France , North Korea and Apartheid Israel while being more difficult with the \u201c big \u201d nuclear weapons states of the US , Russia , China , India and Pakistan .\nAustralia has been critically involved in UK and US nuclear terrorism for 75 years ( supply of uranium , involvement in testing of UK weapons and missile delivery systems , hosting of nuclear weapons-carrying US warships , world-leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in US nuclear terrorism via the Pine Gap and North West Cape communications bases ) [ 3 ] .\nIn addition to this evil complicity in US Alliance nuclear terrorism , Australia \u2019 s present move to the penultimate position of adoption of full-blown nuclear terrorism ( nuclear-powered submarines with weapons-grade enriched uranium ) is utterly unwarranted , in the wrong direction , endangers Humanity and the Biosphere , and warrants comprehensive global Boycotts , Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) against an evil , war criminal , omnicidal , terracidal and nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violation of the spirit and letter of the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) has been adopted and ratified by 191 states , the exceptions including Pakistan , India , North Korea and Apartheid Israel .\nThe nuclear terrorism-based AUKUS deal violates the spirit and the letter of the NPT [ 4 ] .\nWhile Australia technically does not have nuclear weapons , under the AUKUS deal Australia illegally assists its nuclear terrorist associates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition and deployment of nuclear weapons .\nThus the deal to purchase nuclear-powered submarines for Australia retrospectively and indeed prospectively makes such acquisition and deployment by the UK and US cheaper .\nNPT Article I demands that each nuclear-weapons state ( NWS ) undertakes not to transfer , to any recipient , nuclear weapons , or other nuclear explosive devices , and not to assist any non-nuclear weapon state to manufacture or acquire such weapons or devices \u2013 however this is grossly violated by the AUKUS deal in that huge amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly only for submarine propulsion ) to Australia , a warmongering country in which there is considerable public advocacy of a nuclear weapons capacity .\nNPT Article II demands that each non-NWS party undertakes not to receive , from any source , nuclear weapons , or other nuclear explosive devices ; not to manufacture or acquire such weapons or devices ; and not to receive any assistance in their manufacture \u2013 however this is grossly violated by the AUKUS deal in that huge amounts of weapons-grade uranium will be given to a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear power system .\nThe deal for conventionally-powered French submarines did not violate the NPT .\n( 3 ) .\nViolation of the Labor Opposition-supported Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ) .\nThe Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) ( presently in Opposition ) has explicitly stated and confirmed that if it achieves power it will ratify the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ) .\nHowever through Australian receipt of weapons-grade uranium for the submarine reactors , the secret and unilateral AUKUS deal will grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following prohibited activities : \u201c Article 1 Prohibitions : ( 1 ) .\nEach State Party undertakes never under any circumstances

.\nAllow any stationing , installation or deployment of any nuclear weapons or other nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place under its jurisdiction or control \u201d [ 3 , 5 ] .\n( 4 ) .\nGreatly increased nuclear threat to Australia from the AUKUS Alliance .\nThe US- and Zionist-subverted Australian Mainstream journalist , editor , politician , academic and commentariat presstitutes are dangerously , evilly and absurdly talking about \u201c war with China \u201d .\nHowever a moment \u2019 s reflection informs that there would be a hierarchy of targets in any Chinese , Russian , North Korean or whoever response to a huge but limited initial attack by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tor design .\nThus a nuclear attack in response on a US city ( or possibly a critical US base ) would precipitate a massive US nuclear response , and the end of the world .\nHowever after a retaliatory nuclear attack on a US-allied Australian target ( e.g .\na small Australian city ) the US might sensibly decide to leave it there .\nUS-allied Australia is already a nuclear target , and this new AUKUS Alliance , coupled with the anti-China Quad ( Australia , the US , Japan and India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous calls for war against China , increases the threat further .\n( 5 ) .\nThe AUKUS Alliance simply further locks a nuclear terrorist Australia into UK and US nuclear terrorism committed to mass murder of women and children .\nAustralia , Japan and India have unwisely joined with the US in the anti-China Quad that makes them nuclear targets .\nJapan , South Korea and possibly Taiwan operate under the \u201c protection \u201d of a US \u201c nuclear umbrella \u201d .\nNATO countries associate themselves with US , UK and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The US has about 700 military bases located in over 70 countries that have thus also avoidably made themselves nuclear targets .\nCosta Rica famously does not have an army but other Latin American , African and most Asian and Pacific countries , while having armies ( \u201c defence forces \u201d ) , are not allied with UK and US nuclear terrorism .\nUS lackey Australia does not and should not be associated militarily with the UK and the US , nuclear terrorist rogue states that are fervently committed to mass murder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy .\n( 6 ) .\nThe AUKUS deal means Australia will be only 1 step away from having nuclear weapons on nuclear-powered submarines .\nNuclear terrorism-complicit Australia revels in the myth that its uranium exports are for peaceful purpose only , but the only difference between Australian barrels of uranium oxide for peaceful or war purposes in a French warehouse is simply the labelling on the barrel .\nSimilarly , a state of the art military gun is the same before it is loaded with either acceptable bullets or bullets forbidden by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear powered submarines will potentially be covertly or overtly nuclear armed simply on the basis of ( US-directed ) government fiat .\nIndeed non-nuclear armed but nuclear-powered Australian submarines will be indistinguishable from nuclear-armed UK and US vessels and thus critically enhance Anglo-American nuclear terrorism .\n( 7 ) .\nOther countries may follow Australia \u2019 s despicable and threatening example .\nOn the present basis , Australia will be the only non-NWS ( non-Nuclear Weapons State ) to have nuclear-powered submarines .\nThus Apartheid Israel is closer to the US than Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively Anglosphere 5-eyes intelligence-sharing club ( the US , UK , Canada , Australia and New Zealand ) , the US shares bulk intelligence on Australians with Apartheid Israel [ 6 ] .\nNuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel may well now be saying \u201c me too \u201d to the Americans over nuclear-powered submarines .\nOther countries may be attracted to the idea of having a conventionally or nuclear-armed \u201c deterrent \u201d on nuclear-powered submarines that have global reach , can hide at depth , and only have to surface to replenish food supplies .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear waste , radioactive contamination and \u201c floating Chernobyls \u201d in Australian waters and ports .\nThe leader of the Australian Greens Adam Bandt has declared that the AUKUS deal will put \u201c floating Chernobyls \u201d in every Australian port .\nThis was immediately condemned by the US lackey Australian Mainstream as false and hysterical , citing the good safety record of nuclear power stations and nuclear submarines .\nHowever the rejoinder is that nuclear power stations and nuclear-powered submarines are only \u201c safe \u201d until they appallingly cease being so , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , Fukushima and numerous US and Russian nuclear submarine disasters [ 7 ] .\nThe AUKUS deal has renewed insistent calls for a major nuclear waste industry ( e.g .\nto take UK and US nuclear waste ) and a nuclear power industry in Australia .\nConventional nuclear power is expensive , dirty , generates horrendously long-term radioactive waste , is a massive security threat , and is non-renewable \u2013 in our present carbon economy all steps of the nuclear cycle ( excepting nuclear fission ) involves massive generation of CO2 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stations to de-commissioning power stations and safe disposal of highly radioactive waste .\n( 9 ) .\nAUKUS deceit trashes trust in Australia and \u201c national security \u201d ; nuclear mass murder is an utterly unacceptable military strategy .\nThe Americans might argue that they were compelled to develop nuclear weapons first out of fear that genocidally racist Nazi Germany would do so .\nThence the Russians felt compelled to follow suit in response to the real threat from the US , and then the British , the French etc .\nHowever rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 9 nuclear weapons states ( NWS ) should not adopt nuclear weapons nor enter into NWS alliances that make them nuclear targets .\nWhite Australia was a fervent ally of the genocidally racist UK for over 150 years before it switched total allegiance to the US with the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 .\nPost-WW2 Australia assisted UK acquisition of nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems but became intimately involved in US nuclear terrorism through the Pine Gap and North West Cape communications bases , the hosting of US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Asian wars ( atrocities associated with 40 million Asian deaths from violence or war-imposed deprivation ) .\nThe morally bankrupt Australian Coalition Government has now taken this moral degeneracy to one step away from having nuclear-armed as well as nuclear-powered submarines to existentially threaten the 4 billion people in the Indo-Pacific region .\nFormer Australian Coalition PM Malcolm Fraser described Australia \u2019 s US lackey subservience as dangerous stupidity : \u201c Slavish devotion to the US a foreign policy folly for Australia \u201d [ 8 ] .\nFormer Labor PM Paul Keating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear submarine obscenity : \u201c The notion that Australia is in a state of military apprehension about China , or needs to be , is a distortion and lie of the worst and most grievous proportions .\nBy its propagation , Australia is determinedly casting China as an enemy \u2013 and in the doing of it , actually creating an enemy where none exists.\u2026 I have also said before , but worth repeating , that when it comes to major international conflagration , land beats water every time .\nThrough this submarine purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of the United States , while setting itself into a military position incapable of defeating Chinese land-based and sea denial forces .\nIt takes a monster level of incompetence to forfeit military control of one \u2019 s own state , but this is what Scott Morrison and his government have managed to do \u201d [ 9 ] .\nFormer Coalition PM Malcolm Turnbull ( betrayed and supplanted s PM by Scott \u201c Scomo \u201d Morrison aka Scum-o , Scam-o , Skim-o , Scam-o and Smirk-o ) : \u201c The Australian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2014 it won \u2019 t be forgotten .\nEvery time we seek to persuade another nation to trust us , somebody will be saying , \u2018 remember what you did to Macron ?\n\u2019 When you conduct yourself in such a deceitful manner internationally , it has a real impact on Australia \u201d [ 10 ] .\nThe UK Morning Star has reported : \u201c Delegates at the [ 2021 UK ] Labour Party conference overwhelmingly backed a motion expressing solidarity with Palestine and condemning Israel \u2019 s apartheid policies today , delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe passing of Young Labour \u2019 s historic motion , which marks the first time a major British political party has backed the United Nations \u2019 definition of Israel as an apartheid state , came after shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy failed to mention the country \u2019 s occupation of Palestine in her keynote speech\u2026 Labour delegates also backed an emergency motion condemning the Aukus pact with the US and Australia against China , saying it was \u201c a dangerous move that undermines world peace.\n\u201d [ Labour leader ] Sir Keir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pact \u201d [ 11 ] .\nNuclear mass murder of women , children and men is an utterly unacceptable military strategy .\nAustralia should join over 120 other countries that have nothing to do with US nuclear terrorism and thus take Australia off the list of nuclear targets .\nIndeed a morally decent Australia would go further , sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons ( TPNW ) , leave its alliance with the genocidally racist , and mother- and child-killing UK and US , and urge and implement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BDS ) against all NWS and non-NWS countries involved in nuclear terrorism .\n( 10 ) .\nAustralia is second only to the US as a supporter of serial war criminal and nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel .\nCowardly , racist and utterly unprincipled US lackey Australia imposes US- and Apartheid Israel-supported sanctions on non-NWS Iran for allegedly wanting to become a NWS .\nIn reality Iran wants a nuclear-weapons free Middle East , denies wanting nuclear weapons , and has not invaded another country in about 1,400 years .\nIn contrast Australia- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacked 13 countries , still occupies the territory of 4 countries , possesses 90 nuclear weapons plus submarine-based and other and missile delivery systems , and in addition to perpetrating the ongoing Palestinian Genocide ( 90 % of Palestine ethnically cleansed of Indigenous inhabitants , and 2.2 million Palestinian deaths from violence , 0.1 million , and imposed deprivation , 2.1 million since 1914 ) , played a key role in the Cote D \u2019 Ivoire civil war , the South Sudan Civil War , the Guatemalan Mayan Genocide , the Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNevertheless mendacious , racist , war criminal and Zionist-subverted Australia identifies with fellow settler-colonial state Apartheid Israel , and as a lackey of Zionist-subverted US Australia is second only to the US as a supporter of serial war criminal and nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel .\n( 1 ) .\nThe UK has

a coastal village in Indonesia \u2019 s West Papua province , seems like an idyllic place .\nBut some residents consider it a hostile , almost inhospitable place due to its remoteness and the heavy rains that can make traveling by boat a deadly prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling with our lives , \u201d says Hendrikus Malalu , a resident .\n\u201c God still loves us \u2014 if he didn \u2019 t , we \u2019 d all have perished by now.\n\u201d The only way for the villagers to travel to other parts of the region is by sea ; there \u2019 s no road access .\nThe village also only has electricity at night , when the villagers turn on their diesel-powered generators .\nAmid these restrictions , two of the three clans in the village welcomed a palm oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the only way out .\nAnd now that the permits of the company , PT Papua Lestari Abadi ( PLA ) , have been revoked by the government of Sorong district , where the village is located , the Indigenous people there have been left questioning their future and afraid of the fallout of the revocation .\nPLA was one of several palm oil companies that saw their permits revoked following a government audit in West Papua province , which is home to some of the largest swaths of intact forest left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a moratorium by the central government to freeze the issuance of new palm oil licenses , in the wake of fires on oil palm concessions and years of uncontrolled deforestation associated with the industry .\nThe moratorium , which expired in September this year , also mandated a review of all existing licenses , in the same vein as a previous review of mining licenses that saw more than 2,000 permits cancelled based on irregularities that came to light .\nVery few oil palm permits were revoked by the central government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut in West Papua , the provincial government revoked the licenses of 14 companies after finding a litany of irregularities and violations .\nThe West Papua move , coming at the tail end of the moratorium , may serve as a test case for how government officials approach trying to cancel licenses held by potentially powerful companies .\nThis may still be possible despite the moratorium having expired , since the government says Indonesia will use existing regulations to address sustainability issues in the palm oil industry .\nShortly after the provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another affected company , PT Sorong Agro Sawitindo ( SAS ) , which held a concession in the village of Gisim , filed a against Johny Kamuru , the Sorong district head .\nThe two companies are seeking to have a court annul the government \u2019 s decision and give them back their concessions .\nThey argue the move to revoke their licenses has harmed them .\nBenidiktus Hery Wijayanto , head of the West Papua provincial agriculture department , said the government had every reason to revoke the two companies \u2019 concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to fulfill their obligations .\nAmong the unfilled obligations is obtaining a right-to-cultivate permit , or HGU , the last in a series of licenses that oil palm companies must obtain before being allowed to start planting .\nThe two companies also appeared to have done nothing since receiving their permits in 2009 , Benidiktus added .\n\u201c They had no activities in Sorong at all , \u201d he says .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t have offices .\nIf you ask government officials in Sorong , there \u2019 s no single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] .\nIt \u2019 s only when we did the evaluation at provincial level that we got [ the documents ] .\n\u201d Benidiktus said he eventually managed to track down a PLA employee , who told him that both PLA and SAS hadn \u2019 t started any activities on their concessions because they didn \u2019 t have any operational funds .\nThat means the companies \u2019 concessions are technically abandoned , which is grounds for a permit revocation , according to Piter Ell , a lawyer for the Sorong district government .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua , Indonesia .\nImage by Hans Nicholas Jong/Mongabay .\nThe man behind the companies Piter said PLA and SAS had also violated the anti-monopoly law by having the same person , Ronald Louis Sanuddin , as their chief executive .\nBoth companies share the same address , which Piter said turned out to be the office of another company , called Papua Diving .\nBenidiktus said the two companies didn \u2019 t have any offices in West Papua province , and that it was only when they filed a lawsuit against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office in Sorong .\nThe similarities between the two companies don \u2019 t stop there .\nAccording to the NGO Pusaka , which advocates for Indigenous rights , PLA and SAS are also owned by the same individual .\nThe shares of both companies are owned by PT Pilar Sukses Sejahtera and PT Global Jaya Abadi Gemilang , two companies that are in turn owned by Paulus George Hung , a businessman from Malaysia .\nHung also serves on the boards of both PLA and SAS , according to Pusaka .\nVillagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having approached them .\nDaniel Kayaru , the head of the hamlet of Klajaring in Gisim , even referred to him as the \u201c big boss , \u201d while Demianus Yapen , the Waimon village secretary , called him \u201c Mr .\nTing , \u201d a throwback to his old of Ting Ting Hong .\nIn 2006 , Hung was among 50 individuals accused by the Indonesian government of illegal logging operations in the country .\nHe was linked to a ship that was seized with 21,000 cubic meters ( 741,600 cubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters .\nDespite that , Hung was able to get new forestry permits from the government , paving the way for him to keep doing business in Indonesia .\nIt \u2019 s common in Indonesia for businesspeople to operate in both the forestry sector and the plantation sector , as they can benefit from clearing forests and selling the timber before converting the land into plantations .\nPiter said there are indications that many companies applying for oil palm licenses are doing so only to cut down trees and sell the wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing an oil palm plantation .\nPLA and SAS hadn \u2019 t started clearing their respective concessions because they didn \u2019 t have the requisite timber exploitation permits .\nAnother company that had its permits revoked and that is also suing the Sorong district head , PT Inti Kebun Lestari ( IKL ) , had already obtained a timber exploitation permit .\nBenidiktus said when the local government surveyed IKL \u2019 s concession , they detected clearing .\nPhotos from a document drafted by IKL \u2019 s logging operator , CV Aimas Jaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clearing , he added .\nWest Papua and Papua provinces hold some of the last remaining stands of commercially valuable hardwood species in Indonesia , including merbau , a prized target for illegal loggers and timber traffickers .\nWith many irregularities surrounding PLA and SAS , Piter said the court should reject the companies \u2019 lawsuit and declare that their permits had been revoked in accordance with the law .\n\u201c Because before the concessions are revoked , it has gone through a process of multistage evaluation , starting from the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the West Papua provincial government and the Sorong district government , \u201d Piter said .\nThe villagers of Waimon in West Papua , Indonesia .\nImage by Hans Nicholas Jong/Mongabay .\nPrior to filing the lawsuit , PLA approached the Indigenous communities whose areas overlap with its concession in Waimon .\nThey offered money to one of the village \u2019 s three klans , the Kasilik , who accepted it .\nDemianus , the village secretary , said the Kasilik asked for 300 million rupiah ( $ 21,000 ) , but settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the first installment , 50 million rupiah ( $ 3,500 ) , in April .\nThe company also promised to give the clan two houses in Sorong and pay for the education of the Kasilik children through middle school , said Yunus Kasilik , a member of the clan .\nYunus said that amount of money could go a long way in improving the livelihoods of the Waimon villagers .\n\u201c I catch a lot of fish and shrimp .\nHow can I sell them to Sorong since there \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 m not defending palm oil .\nBut can [ the government ] take care of [ our ] road access ?\nElectricity ?\n\u201d Some of the villagers , including Demianus and Yunus , said that if the government could guarantee access to road and electricity for the village , they would happily cancel their agreement with PLA .\n\u201c All I \u2019 m asking for is road and electricity , that \u2019 s all , \u201d Yunus said .\nThe Sorong district government secretary , Cliff Agus Japsenang , questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappearance , suggesting it \u2019 s an attempt by PLA to gain support from the locals for its lawsuit .\n\u201c The companies arrived on the scene this April , May or June , after the permits were revoked , \u201d he said .\n\u201c But let \u2019 s not forget that they \u2019 ve had years [ to fulfill all their legal obligations ] , where they were nowhere [ to be seen ] .\n\u201d Johny , the Sorong district head , said the company \u2019 s sudden appearance after years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn \u2019 t have the local community \u2019 s interest at heart .\nIn Indonesia , cash-strapped local governments often fail to build basic infrastructure , like in the case of Waimon .\nIt \u2019 s not uncommon for agricultural or extractive companies to take on this role .\nBut Johny said his government won \u2019 t abandon the villagers whose areas overlap with the rescinded concessions and who had been promised better lives by the companies .\n\u201c In this situation , the government took a decision [ to revoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people there , \u201d he said in an interview at his house in Sorong .\n\u201c There might be people who understood this , there might be those who don \u2019 t understand yet , thinking that this decision has harmed them.\n\u201d Johny said his government had actually planned to build a road to connect Waimon and other places in the region .\nSections of the road have already been built by Petrogas , an oil and gas company operating in the region , but the project has been halted due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he would communicate with Petrogas again to discuss resuming the road construction .\n\u2018 They promised we can be prosperous \u2019 Waimon is not the only village that has fears over the potential repercussion of the permits revocation .\nIn Gisim , another coastal village in Sorong district , the Indigenous residents face a similar quandary with SAS , the other company suing the Sorong government for revoking its permit .\nResidents there had granted the company the rights to 13,000 hectares ( 32,100 acres ) of their forests .\nThe company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of money , education and housing , according to hamlet chief Daniel .\n\u201c [ They promised ] that we can be prosperous with oil palm plantations , \u201d he said .\n\u201c So we accepted [ SAS ] so that we can change [ our future ] .\nWe can be as prosperous as other places in Kalimantan [ Indonesian Borneo ] and Sulawesi.\n\u201d Up until 2010 , SAS had paid the villagers 500 million rupiah ( $ 35,100 ) , which the community used for various purposes , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel .\nBut after that , the company disappeared , with the villagers unable to contact its representatives , he said .\nIn April , PLA arrived in the village and told residents that it had taken over SAS \u2019 s concession .\nDaniel said the villagers refused to make any deal with PLA until SAS had settled things with them .\n\u201c For the first company [ SAS ] , we deemed them to be just toying with us , \u201d he said .\n\u201c For the new company [ PLA ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new agreements.\n\u201d Like the concession in Waimon , the concession in Gisim was also revoked by the district government following the recent audit because it had been left unmanaged by SAS for more than a decade .\nDaniel said the revocation has further complicated the situation , since it \u2019 s not clear where SAS has gone and whether the villagers will have to pay back the money they received from the company .\n\u201c We \u2019 re afraid of the company .\nDon \u2019 t let it sue us [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d he said .\n\u201c We want to hear the district head say to us , \u2018 Don \u2019 t worry , I \u2019 ll pay off your debt.\n\u2019 We haven \u2019 t met him so we \u2019 re not satisfied yet.\n\u201d Sorong district head Johny said he would protect the villagers \u201c It could be that the people didn \u2019 t know [ better ] and they were intimidated [ to accepting the money ] , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Were they given an understanding and opportunities to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take responsibility.\n\u201d Daniel said that , looking back , he

\u201d he said .\n\u201c After that , we read and see the development in other villages , and we realize that the palm oil company has been trying to lure us with money and [ promises of ]

of the ROK visited the USA once again to participate in the 76th session of the UN General Assembly , where he made a speech separately addressing the issue of peace on the Korean Peninsula .\nThe South Korean President speaking at the UN had previously proposed to declare an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2020 .\nHe added specifics , indicating that the ROK , the DPRK , the USA and China should participate in the process .\nIn addition , Moon Jae-in suggested resuming as soon as possible the program of meetings between separated families of the South and the North , and developing inter-Korean cooperation in the fields of health care and disaster control .\nHowever , he made no mention of the North \u2019 s recent missile launches , remaining cautious about resuming dialogue with Pyongyang .\nOn September 22 , Moon Jae-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean War during a joint ceremony to hand over military remains in Hawaii .\nThe US Department of Defense immediately noted that \u201c we continue to seek engagement with the DPRK to address a variety of issues , and we are open to discussing the possibility of an end of war declaration.\n\u201d At the same time , the Department of Defense spokesman , John Kirby , said the goal is still the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula .\nThe Minister of Unification , Lee In-young , also said that formally ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable and cost-effective measure to demonstrate the absence of hostility and the resumption of nuclear negotiations with North Korea .\nThe conservative and main opposition People Power Party has criticized Moon \u2019 s proposal , saying peace can not be achieved through a declaration .\nAs former North Korean diplomat and current lawmaker Tae Yong-ho has stressed , a declaration of an end to the war should only be considered after North Korea takes a meaningful step toward denuclearization .\nMeanwhile , the North continues to launch missiles and has reportedly begun operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation , \u201c a declaration of cessation of war would only lead North Korea to incorrectly believe that it could see the withdrawal of US troops from the Korean Peninsula.\n\u201d Involving China in a quadrilateral declaration of cessation of war is also unlikely , given the intertwined rivalry between Washington and Beijing .\nMuch more interesting is the North Korean response .\nOn September 23 , Vice Foreign Minister Lee Tae-ho noted that the declaration of the war \u2019 s end is a political declaration officially proclaiming the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lasted for a long time so far .\nIn this sense , it has symbolic value , but so far , the adoption of a declaration ending the war is \u201c premature and can not resolve existing differences.\n\u201d Lee noted a range of US military preparations aimed at the DPRK , including lifting missile restrictions on the ROK or the Minuteman III ICBM launches in February and August of this year .\nAnd he concluded from this that \u201c there is no guarantee that an end-of-war declaration , which is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the abandonment of hostility toward us when the situation on the Korean Peninsula is fraught with explosion.\n\u201d In such a situation , the assurance of an end to the war \u201c will not help stabilize the situation on the Korean Peninsula and can be used as a cover for US hostile policies \u201d .\nA few hours after that , Kim Yo-jong , vice department director of the Central Committee of Korea \u2019 s Workers \u2019 Party , issued a slightly different press statement .\n\u201c An end-of-war declaration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceasefire on the Korean Peninsula and abandoning hostility towards the vis-a-vis is an interesting proposal and a good idea.\n\u201d However , now is not the time to discuss this idea \u2013 \u201c in such an environment , when double standards , bias , hostile policies , hostile words and actions against our state continue , as it is now , \u201d such a statement will lead to group photos at most , and all the problems will remain .\n\u201c Proclaiming the end of the war requires mutual respect on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other side , brutal , hostile policies and unjust double standards must be abolished.\n\u201d If South Korea breaks with past tactics , \u201c always thinking of further words and actions and not acting in a hostile manner , we would be happy to maintain a close understanding between the North and the South again and have constructive discussions on the restoration of relations and their further development.\n\u201d As Blue House Senior Presidential Secretary for Public Affairs Park Soo-hyun said on September 24 , Seoul perceives North Korea \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal as something very important and weighty .\nAs for the two responses from the North on the same day , Park argued that he saw no inconsistency between the statements .\nAgainst this backdrop , Kim Yo-jong again gave \u201c good advice to South Korea \u201d on September 25 : \u201c We can see that the atmosphere of different stratas of South Korea to restore the frozen inter-Korean relations and achieve peaceful stability as soon as possible is strong to the extent that it can not be obstructed , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no need for the North and the South to pick on the other side , engage in rhetoric and waste valuable time.\n\u201d If South Korea wants to restore and develop inter-Korean relations , it should not judge the North \u2019 s actions as \u201c provocations \u201d and engage in doublethink while developing its own military might as a \u201c necessity to deter the North.\n\u201d Therefore , the North is waiting for the South to take action \u201c aimed at removing all sparks that fuel confrontation , including the unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as offensive rhetoric.\n\u201d Only if \u201c impartiality and respect for each other are maintained \u201d can both the restoration of the North-South liaison office and the holding of an inter-Korean summit be discussed constructively .\n\u201c The end of the war will also be proclaimed in due course.\n\u201d Kim noted that all of the above is her personal opinion and recalled that \u201c we already gave advice last August that South Korea should make the right choice.\n\u201d On the other hand , the author uses the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe Korean War of 1950-53 ended with an armistice , technically leaving the divided Koreas in a state of war to this day .\nAt the same time , it was signed by the DPRK , UN troops , and \u201c Chinese volunteers.\n\u201d The ROK representative refused to sign an armistice because Syngman Rhee wanted to fight until the end .\nAs a result , the problem of finally ending the Korean War involved a series of complex legal procedures related to who should sign for whom and what .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict must be signed by its main parties , North Korea , South Korea , the USA , and China , but \u2026 To begin with , formally , it was South Korea and the UN troops that came to its aid , the vast majority of whom were Americans , who fought against North Korea .\nHowever , they were not formally fighting on their own but under the UN flag .\nBut since the North and South are now members of the UN , the UN can not sign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe second problem concerns the involvement of China , which also took part in the war , did so not officially , but in the form of the Chinese People \u2019 s Volunteers .\nThis has helped avoid further escalation of conflicts but is now causing problems .\nIncluding setting a precedent that such an option , originally sent for unofficial participation , is nevertheless equated with official participation .\nAnother problem is that South Korea did not sign the ceasefire agreement .\nIt was then about Lee Seung-Man , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration signed in multilateral format makes all participants equal parties and is an implicit recognition that there are two states on the Korean Peninsula after all , which is really unacceptable at least to the South , whose national security law interprets the North as an anti-state organization controlling part of the ROK territory .\nThe author would like to recall that when Lee Myung-bak thought of eliminating the Ministry of Unification and handing over the inter-Korean issue to the Foreign Ministry at the beginning of his administration , the project was canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a move would recognize North Korea as an independent country rather than an illegally alienated part of the peninsula .\nAgain , what will be the format of the declaration ?\nUnlike a peace treaty , which requires parliamentary approval , a declaration of cessation of war is a non-binding political statement and a more straightforward step for both Washington and Pyongyang .\nHowever , the question arises to what extent such a statement would be legally enforceable .\nOn the other hand , the war \u2019 s end will remove an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In war , many means unacceptable in peacetime are suitable , and wartime emergencies justify a lot in domestic politics .\nNorth Korea has repeatedly put forward proposals to end the Korean War , but it seems to the author that the goal is not so much to end the conflict with the South as to end the war with America .\nThis is why proposals to end the war were put forward by Pyongyang during the talks with the US , as a ceasefire agreement preserves the state of war , opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHowever , it is essential to Pyongyang that the signed document does not turn into a piece of paper with no relevance to the actual state of affairs .\nThat \u2019 s why Kim Yo-jong \u2019 s response boiled down to the phrase , \u201c we \u2019 ll come back to this issue when Seoul \u2019 s policy toward Pyongyang becomes less hostile and other than words you start to move towards it.\n\u201d And the separation of words from deeds is an important matter because the author constantly draws attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as a supporter of dialogue according to the rhetoric , fundamental steps in this direction can be made only after the third strike of his fist on the table .\nBut military spending and other preparations are growing in ways that conservatives have never dreamed of .\nThen , even if all parties agree , it will take some time before Moon \u2019 s presidential term is up , and not every Democratic candidate will be as enthusiastic about the idea .\nAs the most leftist , Lee Jae-myung is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to see the election .\nTherefore , this proposal was considered and not rejected as a matter of principle but postponed until better times .\nAnd when those times come , judging by Kim Jong-un \u2019 s sister \u2019 s speech , it \u2019 s up to Seoul to decide .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below

, Russia would like to regulate its growing competition with France in Africa ( especially in the vast region of \u2018 Fran\u00e7afrique \u2019 that Paris considers to be its exclusive \u2018 sphere of influence \u2019 ) while encouraging India to enter into a meaningful rapprochement with China .\nLast week \u2019 s announcement of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance is already backfiring on America after it unprecedentedly offended its oldest French ally and also resulted in uncomfortable racial optics of Anglo-American superiority within the Quad that strongly implied India \u2019 s \u201c junior partner \u201d status within that structure .\nThese consequences are still manageable though since France won \u2019 t leave NATO in protest like some have speculated nor will India abandon the Quad .\nThose two countries \u2019 leaderships still believe that their national interests are advanced by continuing to participate in efforts to \u201c contain \u201d China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust deficit between their governments and America \u2019 s after what just happened .\nThis might reduce the overall effectiveness of their joint measures to \u201c contain \u201d China .\nIt \u2019 s this observation that inadvertently opens up diplomatic opportunities for Russia with both of them , which could bolster Moscow \u2019 s balancing act if it successfully capitalizes on this .\nFrance and India regard America as more unreliable than ever before , and this perception likely won \u2019 t dissipate no matter how much time passes .\nParis naively fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly elected Democrat leader promised that \u201c America is back \u201d and that he \u2019 d thus respect Washington \u2019 s allies unlike his predecessor .\nNew Delhi , meanwhile , was already concerned that Trump \u2019 s successor would compromise on its interests since his team seemed not to appreciate their country \u2019 s anti-Chinese \u201c containment \u201d role as much as the Republican did .\nFrance just found out the hard way that the US is untrustworthy regardless of whichever part of the duopoly is officially running its affairs after Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine deal from Paris with Canberra upon clinching this major military alliance behind its back .\nAs for India , its leadership is more self-conscious than ever before that the US doesn \u2019 t consider it to be an equal and is thus very worried that this risks dooming the South Asian state to a fate of perpetual second-class status vis-a-vis America .\nRussia can take advantage of these concerns as its diplomatic angle of approach for engaging them in order to explore two very exciting diplomatic opportunities .\nIdeally , Russia would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France in Africa ( especially in the vast region of \u201c Fran\u00e7afrique \u201d that Paris considers to be its exclusive \u201c sphere of influence \u201d ) while encouraging India to enter into a meaningful rapprochement with China .\nThese two geostrategic tasks are among the most important ones for contemporary Russian foreign policy .\nThey aren \u2019 t unrealistic to achieve either in light of AUKUS .\nThe French and Indian Foreign Ministers already released a joint statement pledging \u201c to work on a joint program of concrete actions to defend a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interpreted as a signal to the US of their intense dissatisfaction with that alliance .\nThose two countries are clearly interested in \u201c multi-aligning \u201d with one another in order to create a more trustworthy axis of cooperation within the world \u2019 s growing anti-Chinese \u201c containment \u201d network .\nThis demonstrates several shared desires on both of their parts : increase strategic autonomy vis-a-vis the US ; creatively multi-align in pursuit of this end ; and potentially go as far as offending America in the process by keeping it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is contradictory to what Russia could attempt to explore with each of them .\nTo the contrary , they \u2019 re complementary and strategically consistent .\nThe outcomes that Moscow might advance would be mutually beneficial within this context .\nTo explain , France is increasingly being forced to accept that Russian influence in Fran\u00e7afrique must be reckoned with since it \u2019 s too powerful of a factor nowadays to ignore .\nInstead of remaining mired in a \u201c hybrid \u201d competition , both Great Powers would do better to discretely delineate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both geopolitically and also strategically within those African countries where they overlap .\nThe US wants them to remain at each other \u2019 s throats there so that it can then swoop in to capitalize on the chaos .\nThe solution is to negotiate a so-called \u201c non-aggression pact \u201d there whereby France and Russia agree to \u201c freeze \u201d their competition for a certain period of time , cooperate on issues where their interests align like anti-terrorism and socio-economic development , and thus contribute to Africa \u2019 s stabilization .\nThis would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these competitive dynamics in an attempt to sideline both of their interests as it seeks to advance its own .\nIt would also show how truly independent French foreign policy is becoming .\nWhen it comes to India , New Delhi can no longer completely rely on Washington \u2019 s support when it comes to \u201c containing \u201d China .\nThere \u2019 s only so far that the South Asian state can go towards this end without suffering unacceptable costs that it now knows that its new ally won \u2019 t help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel India to seek some sort of accommodation with China similar to the one that was proposed above between France and Russia , which their shared partners in the Kremlin might help them broker .\nCandidly speaking and with full respect to India , its leadership is extremely self-conscious of how their country is perceived and treated by the US , so much so that some observers can convincingly claim that they suffer from an inferiority complex .\nThis isn \u2019 t being brought up as a criticism but to hint at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to behave more independently vis-a-vis the US after being condescendingly treated as its \u201c junior partner \u201d if Russia mediates an improvement of ties with China in response upon their request .\nIt \u2019 s more important than ever for France and India to increase their strategic autonomy relative to the US after both were so brazenly disrespected by it through AUKUS .\nThey also have a pressing need to repair their soft power at home and abroad .\nTheir people are upset at America trampling over them in such a humiliating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beginning to think that they \u2019 re just powerless puppets if they don \u2019 t do anything significant in response .\nTheir geopolitical interests and prestige are therefore on the line .\nBoth sets of problems can be adequately resolved through the proposed solutions with Russia .\nFrance and India would bolster their strategic autonomy by regulating competition with Russia in Africa and with China in Asia , respectively , which would open up a new array of geopolitical opportunities for them that they didn \u2019 t have before .\nTheir people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are conducting their foreign policy , especially in spite of America \u2019 s expected misgivings , while the world would be impressed with this as well .\nThe only potential wrinkle in this scenario is the emerging French-Russian competition for India \u2019 s arms market .\nParis has recently become one of New Delhi \u2019 s top partners , which makes its historical ones in Moscow very uncomfortable .\nBe that as it may , each Great Power could potentially fulfill different military needs for their shared partner .\nRussia has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence \u201d in this strategic space while France could replace America \u2019 s present role there if the US sanctions India for its S-400 air defense purchase .\nAmerican-Indian military cooperation isn \u2019 t anywhere close in terms of value to the AUS $ 90 billion nuclear-powered submarine deal that the US poached from France with Australia , but Paris could still make up for some lost financial opportunities by attempting to poach Washington \u2019 s future deals with New Delhi .\nIn fact , France and the US are more akin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they are competitors with Russia , whether separately or jointly .\nTheir intensified competition there could advance Russian and Indian interests .\nIndia is one of the world \u2019 s top arms purchasers and will continue to attempt to \u201c contain \u201d China even if it doesn \u2019 t do so to the radical extent that the US demands .\nComparatively speaking , the expansion of French influence in India through \u201c military diplomacy \u201d via arms sales would be a more moderating force than its American counterpart .\nRussia would obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort of influence over its special and privileged strategic partner , but if it \u2019 s inevitable to a degree , then it \u2019 s better for it to be French than American .\nFrom the Indian perspective , it could play France and the US off against one another in order to get the best deals from both .\nIn the event that the US goes through with its threats to sanction the country for purchasing Russia \u2019 s S-400 air defense systems , then India \u2019 s strategic autonomy wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it could just multi-align away from America and towards France in order to meet its pertinent military needs that it feels more comfortable relying on Western countries to achieve than on Russia for whatever reason .\nTo recap the insight that was shared in this analysis , France and India aren \u2019 t likely to have any serious rupture in their relations with the US such as leaving NATO and the Quad respectively , but their ties with it won \u2019 t be the same again due to the enormous trust deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic opportunities for Russia to explore a \u201c non-aggression \u201d pact with France in Africa and the possibility of mediating an Indian-Chinese rapprochement , both of which would serve their interests while sending a strong signal to the US .\nNote to readers : please click the share buttons above or below

terms as non-self-governing territories\u2014read colonies\u2014giving France a vast exclusive economic zone , larger even than that of the United States .\nThe United States considers these islands less strategically valuable than Australia , which explains its willingness to face France \u2019 s anger .\nIn the U.S. worldview , NATO and the Quad are both being downgraded for a new military strategy of a naval thrust against China .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the eight nuclear submarines are to be manufactured partially in Australia , the infrastructure required for manufacturing nuclear submarines and producing/handling of highly enriched uranium that the U.S. submarines use will probably require a minimum time of 20 years .\nThat is the reason behind the talk of U.S. naval and air bases in Australia , with the United States providing the nuclear submarines and fighter-bomber aircraft either on lease , or simply locating them in Australia .\nI have previously argued that the term Indo-Pacific may make sense to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are essentially maritime nations .\nThe optics of three maritime powers , two of which are settler-colonial , while the other , the erstwhile largest colonial power , talking about a rule-based international order do not appeal to most of the world .\nOceans are important to maritime powers , who have used naval dominance to create colonies .\nThis was the basis of the dominance of British , French and later U.S. imperial powers .\nThat is why they all have large aircraft carriers : they are naval powers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they built their empires still works .\nThe United States has 700-800 military bases spread worldwide ; Russia has about 10 ; and China has only one base in Djibouti , Africa .\nBehind the rhetoric about the Indo-Pacific and open seas is the U.S. play in Southeast Asia .\nHere , the talk of the Indo-Pacific has little resonance for most people .\nIts main interest is in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) , which was spearheaded by the ASEAN countries .\nEven with the United States and India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15-member trading bloc is the largest trading bloc in the world , with nearly 30 percent of the world \u2019 s GDP and population .\nTwo of the Quad partners\u2014Japan and Australia\u2014are in the RCEP .\nThe U.S. strategic vision is to project its maritime power against China and contest for control over even Chinese waters and economic zones .\nThis is the 2018 U.S. Pacific strategy doctrine that it has itself put forward , which it de-classified recently .\nThe doctrine states that the U.S. naval strategy is to deny China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first island chain and dominate all domains outside the first island chain .\nFor those interested in how the U.S. views the Quad and India \u2019 s role in it , this document is a good education .\nThe United States wants to use the disputes that Vietnam , the Philippines , Indonesia , Thailand and Malaysia have with China over the boundaries of their respective exclusive economic zones .\nWhile some of them may look to the United States for support against China , none of these Southeast Asian countries supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navigation , under which it carries out its Freedom of Navigation Operations , or FONOPS .\nAs India found to its cost in Lakshadweep , the U.S. definition of the freedom of navigation does not square with India \u2019 s either .\nFor all its talk about rule-based world order , the United States has not signed the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) either .\nSo when India and other partners of the United States sign on to Freedom of Navigation statements of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the freedom of navigation , which is at variance with theirs .\nThe 1973 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty created two classes of countries , ones who would be allowed to a set of technologies that could lead to bomb-grade uranium or plutonium , and others who would be denied these technologies .\nThere was , however , a submarine loophole in the NPT and its complementary IAEA Safeguards for the peaceful use of atomic energy .\nUnder the NPT , non-nuclear-weapon-state parties must place all nuclear materials under International Atomic Energy Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military purposes .\nNo country until now has utilized this submarine loophole to withdraw weapon-grade uranium from safeguards .\nIf this exception is utilized by Australia , how will the United States continue to argue against Iran \u2019 s right to enrich uranium , say for nuclear submarines , which is within its right to develop under the NPT ?\nIndia was never a signatory to the NPT , and therefore is a different case than that of Australia .\nIf Australia , a signatory , is allowed to use the submarine loophole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as well ?\nAustralia did not have to travel this route if it wanted nuclear submarines .\nThe French submarines that they were buying were originally nuclear submarines but using low-enriched uranium .\nIt is retrofitting diesel engines that has created delays in their supplies to Australia .\nIt appears that under the current Australian leadership of Prime Minister Scott Morrison , Australia wants to flex its muscles in the neighborhood , therefore tying up with Big Brother , the United States .\nFor the United States , if Southeast Asia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia is a very useful springboard .\nIt also substantiates what has been apparent for some time now\u2014that the Indo-Pacific is only cover for a geostrategic competition between the United States and China over Southeast Asia .\nAnd unfortunately for the United States , East Asia and Southeast Asia have reciprocal economic interests that bring them closer to each other .\nAnd Australia , with its brutal settler-colonial past of genocide and neocolonial interventions in Southeast Asia , is not seen as a natural partner by countries there .\nIndia under Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot completely .\nDoes it want strategic autonomy , as was its policy post-independence ?\nOr does it want to tie itself to a waning imperial power , the United States ?\nThe first gave it respect well beyond its economic or military clout .\nThe current path seems more and more a path toward losing its stature as an independent player .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\netc

the sun is shining , you have got to put sunscreen on .\nThis is the same thing.\n\u201d Numerous organisations across Australia , private and public , jumped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance in order to suppress the virus .\nThe National Waste and Recycling Industry Council , to name one enthusiastic participant , claimed that the COVIDSafe App , \u201c together with good hygiene , safe work practices and social distancing will help protect the health of waste and recycling staff and our committee.\n\u201d Seven million people also seemed to agree in downloading the app .\nBut problems began to burgeon .\nIdentifying close contacts did not seem to be the app \u2019 s forte .\nThere were issues about its performance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , had a habit of trying to link with each device a user \u2019 s phone had ever been connected to .\n\u201c Every time the Bluetooth controller disconnects from a device , such as when COVIDSafe successfully exchanges data with another app user , it will attempt to reconnect 15 seconds later , \u201d wrote Stilgherrian in July last year .\nNew South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard had to concede in October 2020 that COVIDSafe had \u201c obviously not worked as well as we had hoped \u201d .\nTo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privacy concerns and trust in government .\nThe review by consultants Abt Associates , commissioned by the federal government and delivered in March this year , did not make for pretty reading .\nIt took the persistence of The Canberra Times to obtain a more complete version of the report which had initially been released in severely redacted form .\n( The redacted evaluation was rather more glowing in concluding that \u201c the COVIDSafe app was the correct tool to employ.\n\u201d ) The app , it was found , had added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c without optimisation of benefits.\n\u201d This included , for example , the presence of false close contacts among 205 individuals flagged by the app ( some 61 % ) with 30 % already identified through standard contact tracing .\nA mere 2 per cent of total close contacts in NSW between March and November had been detected by the app , with none in Victoria and Queensland .\nBy May 2021 , costing as much as $ 100,000 a month to continue its operation , the Digital Transformation Agency chief Randall Brugeaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVIDSafe has moved into what we call the business-as-usual state and so we apply very small amounts of maintenance.\n\u201d With a matter of fact telling that would have proved unbearable to the thrifty types , Brugeaud suggested that the amount could change to $ 200,000 a month \u201c to allow us to make future changes.\n\u201d These were additional totals to the $ 6.7 million the app had already cost till that point , most of which had been swallowed by development outlays .\nSuch costs are far from draw dropping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture has involved .\nThe Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) platform may well claim to have led the pack , but then came Delv , Boston Consulting Group and the Melbourne-based outfit Shine Solutions .\nIn November 2020 , it was reported that the latter had received $ 350,000 in increased payments from the federal government , bringing the then total to $ 2 million for work on an app that had , as yet , to identify any new close contact anywhere other than the state of New South Wales

Australia and effectiveness of our contact tracing processes has created an environment in which it has rarely been necessary for public officials to use the app , except to confirm cases through manual processes.\n\u201d COVIDSafe keeps company with several similar apps on tracing that have been left in their wake by renewed infection waves and the discovery of vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their advocates have not stopped their fires of conviction .\nA co-authored contribution in the Journal of Medical Ethics insists that we should not have too many hang-ups on overly centralised data in

our approach to digital contact racing in our fight against COVID-19.\n\u201d Any identifiable moral here must lie in the risk posed by zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrious human contact tracers and may have even inhibited them .\n\u201c The lure of automating the painstaking process of contact tracing is apparent , \u201d a co-authored report from the Brookings Institute asserts .\n\u201c But to date , no one has demonstrated that it \u2019 s possible to do so reliably despite numerous concurrent attempts.\n\u201d The authors even go so far as to suggest that such apps can \u201c serve as

Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslim Populations .\nIt also claims on a second page about funding that : A crowdfunder page has raised nearly \u00a3250 000 , with an initial amount of around $ 115 000 dollars donated by the Uyghur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What isn \u2019 t mentioned is that the World Uyghur Congress , along with many of the supposed experts and witnesses providing statements during the supposed tribunal , are funded by the United States government through the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) .\nThis includes the president of WUC himself , Dolkun Isa , who provided a statement on June 4 , 2021 .\nOther members of US NED-funded organizations participating in the so-called tribunal included Muetter Illiqud of the NED-funded Uyghur Transitional Justice Database ( UTJD ) , Rushan Abbas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Uyghurs , Bahram Sintash and Elise Anderson of the NED-funded Uyghur Human Rights Project and Laura Harth of Safeguard Defenders , formerly known as the

been active in promoting US-funded propaganda regarding Xinjiang for years alongside other mainstays like Rushan Abbas and Louisa Greve .\nNearly every other \u201c witness \u201d brought before the so-called tribunal has a long-established history of participating in the US government-funded propaganda campaign aimed at China and its alleged abuses in Xinjiang .\nThis includes Omir Bekali who was previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Congress in 2018 , Asiye Abdulahed who claims to be the alleged source of the so-called \u201c China Files , \u201d Zumret Dawut whose allegations were used by former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in attacks aimed at China , and Tursunay Ziyawudun who spoke in front of Congress in 2021 .\nThere were also Westerners representing corporate-funded think tanks long engaged in a propaganda war with China including Nathan Ruser of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute ( ASPI ) , Darren Byler and Jessica Batke of \u201c ChileFile \u201d \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Australian and Japanese governments as well as Open Society , and Charles Parton of the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) funded by the US State Department , the EU , Canada , Qatar , the UK , Japan , Australia , as well as arms manufacturers like BAE , Airbus , Lockheed , Northrop Grumman , Raytheon , and General Dynamics .\nOnly a handful of participants appeared to be relatively new faces , perhaps drawn from lesser corners of the global Uyghur diaspora being cultivated by the US as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tedious and lengthy with a total of nearly 80 hours recorded and uploaded to the Uyghur Tribunal \u2019 s YouTube channel .\nHowever , spot checking any of the testimony reveals massive discrepancies .\nFor example , on the first day of hearings , Muetter Illiqud of the abovementioned US government-funded UTJD provided conflicting total numbers of Uyghurs allegedly interned as well as conflicting accounts regarding Chinese government restrictions on the number of children permitted in cities and in rural villages .\nIlliqud failed to explain the discrepancies and was invited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to return in September with the discrepancies fixed .\nAnother alleged witness , Gulzire Alwuqanqizi who spoke with an NED-affiliated \u201c ChinaAid \u201d banner behind her , claimed in her written statement that she was forced to work in a factory for a month and a half ( approximately 45 days ) where she claims she made a total of 2,000 gloves .\nYet in her spoken statement she claims she was never able to meet the daily quota of 20 gloves and instead made only 10-12 .\nIf that is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most 540 gloves .\nShe was never asked to clarify this discrepancy .\nAlso in her written statement , she claims she was caught sending photos of the factory to her husband .\nShe claims : One day , I took a picture of the factory and sent it to him .\nFrom there it became public .\nFollowing this , I was interrogated , they asked the same questions they had always asked , all night long , but eventually they let me go .\nYet in her spoken statement , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were producing the gloves , I sent a photo and as punishment I was put in something like a ditch , a 20 meter deep well .\nThey threw some electric currents at me , they poured water on me , and kept me there for 24 hours .\nNo comment was made by the panel interviewing her regarding this glaring inconsistency either .\nAnother witness , Tursunay Ziyawudun , claimed in her written statement to have been detained upon entering China after living in Kazakhstan from 2011 to 2016 .\nShe inferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US NED-funded World Uyghur Congress during an interrogation , and claimed : I didn \u2019 t even know what World Uyghur Congresses were at that time .\nWe don \u2019 t have access to this information in China .\nYet clearly , while living in Kazakhstan for 5 years prior to returning to China , she did have access to this information .\nIt is yet another inconsistency left unchallenged by the so-called tribunal .\nOut of about 80 hours of proceedings , there is always bound to be inconsistencies , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took no action at all , skipping past them , excusing them , or allowing witnesses to alter their claims at a later date to iron out obvious inconsistencies .\nAll of this further calls into question the professionalism , objectivity , and integrity of the entire \u201c tribunal.\n\u201d Of course , no one in the public will likely watch any of the testimony first hand , let alone cross examine the spoken statements with their written statements .\nThe general public will instead rely on the Western media \u2019 s interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlights designed to prey on the public \u2019 s emotions .\nThe \u201c Uyghur Tribunal \u201d \u2013 a Bad Sequel to the \u201c China Tribunal \u201d The so-called \u201c Uyghur Tribunal \u201d unfolds as a sort of sequel to the 2019 \u201c China Tribunal.\n\u201d The China Tribunal and the Uyghur Tribunal following it were both chaired by Geoffrey Nice and included Hamid Sabi , Nicholas Vetch , and Aarif Abraham as participants .\nBoth were initiated and funded by US government-funded organizations .\nWhile the WUC organized the Uyghur Tribunal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China ( ETAC ) was the organization behind the \u201c China Tribunal.\n\u201d ETAC \u2019 s own webpage does not disclose its funding , but provides a list of names on its \u201c international advisory committee.\n\u201d They include Louisa Greve who was part of the NED \u2019 s senior leadership for 24 years before shifting over to the NED-funded Uyghur Human Rights Project .\nEthan Gutmann is also listed .\nHis book , \u201c The Slaughter , \u201d regarding alleged human organ harvesting in China , was launched at an NED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also Benedict Rogers , an advisor to the NED-funded World Uyghur Congress .\nIn other words , both tribunals were not tribunals at all , but instead an exhibition put on by a US government-funded troupe of activists deeply invested in maligning China and helping advance US foreign policy objectives versus Beijing .\nIt is merely a larger , more elaborate version of a literal exhibition funded by the US government and organized by the World Uyghur Congress in Geneva Switzerland also this year .\nA September 2021 Reuters article titled , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricks \u2019 over Uyghur exhibit , \u201d would note : A US-backed Uyghur photo exhibit of dozens of people who are missing or alleged to be held in camps in Xinjiang , China , opened in Switzerland on Thursday , prompting Beijing to issue a furious statement accusing Washington of \u201c low political tricks \u201d .\nThe United States gave a financial grant for the exhibit , which will later travel to Brussels and Berlin , the World Uyghur Congress told Reuters .\nEarlier this week , the US mission in Geneva displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sources who attended .\n\u201c We are committed to placing human rights at the center of our China policy , and we will continue to highlight the grave human rights abuses we see the PRC committing across China , in Xinjiang , Tibet , Hong Kong , and elsewhere , \u201d a US mission spokesperson said , referring to the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nThe US , guilty of the very worst crimes against humanity of the 21st century , only claims to put human rights at the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nNo mention is made of the US \u2019 decades of supporting violent separatism in China including in Tibet and Xinjiang \u2013 creating the very real terrorism China \u2019 s security measures were put in place to combat .\nNo mention or note is made in articles about the \u201c Uyghur Tribunal \u201d regarding the constant use of the term \u201c East Turkestan \u201d instead of Xinjiang or the fact that most of the people speaking at the tribunal are separatists and at least partly responsible for the violence and instability that seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made about the constant presence of East Turkestan separatist flags in the backgrounds as witnesses provide testimony .\nAt one point in the proceedings , pro-separatist Arslan Hidayat was seen interpreting for at least two witnesses .\nHidayat has repeatedly called for Xinjiang to be ethnically cleansed of Han Chinese .\nAs China reacted to the violence the US fuelled \u2013 the US used accusations of human rights abuses to hamstring and undermine Chinese efforts to restore peace and stability .\nThe US uses the sword of state-sponsored terrorism to strike at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights advocacy to defend US-sponsored separatists from justice .\nThe \u201c Uyghur Tribunal \u201d is merely the latest and perhaps grandest iteration of this strategy of striking and defending .\nThe tribunal \u2019 s final \u201c ruling \u201d will be read in December 2021 , just ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and a concerted US-led media campaign to call for the world \u2019 s boycott of the games .\nBeyond that , further sanctions could be leveled against China \u2013 all in the wake of a clearly US-engineered show tribunal dishonestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d and \u201c human rights advocacy.\n\u201d The harsh irony is that the US seeks to blunt China \u2019 s rise specifically so it can continue acting on the

now with strong bipartisan support .\nThe policy has all the elements of containment of China , including restrictions on technology , trade , investment , formation of the informal Quad ( US-Japan-Australia-India ) alliance , sale of nuclear-powered submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Chinese exports , and increased official contacts with Taiwan in a period of growing China-Taiwan military tension .\nOne element , which until recently had strong support across the US political spectrum , is educational and scientific exchanges with China .\nApproximately 370,000 students and scholars from China , by far the largest number of any country , are in the US , nearly a third engaged in STEM ( science , technology , engineering , mathematics ) research .\nBut now , as relations with China have deteriorated , Democrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers , especially those in science and technology , with suspicion and even hostility .\nBiden , like Trump , has made obtaining J-1 and F-1 visas very difficult for Chinese graduate students and researchers , denying them based not on individual cases but on any possible connection they may have to any Chinese \u201c entity \u201d doing \u201c military-civil \u201d research .\nSadly , many Chinese students no longer feel welcome .\nFollowing Trump \u2019 s lead , the Biden justice department and FBI are engaged in intense oversight of universities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis so-called China Initiative is designed to catch not only Chinese nationals but American citizens , especially those of Chinese descent , who are suspected of engaging in theft or transfer of information that benefits Beijing .\nThe scope of the Initiative is exceptionally wide , extending beyond theft of trade and intellectual property secrets to \u201c potential threats to academic freedom , \u201d surveillance of Chinese registered as foreign agents , prevention of threats to supply chains , and identification of possible corruption in Chinese companies that compete with US companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two respects : its built-in bias and its failure to recognize the many benefits of exchanges with China .\nThe bias stems from a presumption of guilt and guilt by association , hallmarks of the McCarthyism era .\nThat much is clear from the mindless attacks on Confucius Institutes , which are typically attached to US universities and provide free language and cultural instruction to nearby communities .\nFrom personal research as well as the research of others who have interviewed university officials and community members , I can say with confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular from Congress members , of being communist party organs and seeking to undermine academic freedom are spurious .\nYet the charges persist , making no distinction between education and espionage or between Confucian Institutes abroad ( where there have been cases of political interference ) and those in the US .\nAnd the charges have been backed not just by tighter visa requirements but also by threats to universities to either eliminate their Confucius Institute or lose federal funding .\nThe threats have worked , reducing the number of Cis from over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universities that have closed their CIs under US government pressure are the University of Michigan , the University of Oregon , the University of Maryland , the University of South Carolina , and my own Portland State University .\nThe federal government \u2019 s bias also has a racial element .\nA large group of Stanford University faculty , in calling for termination of the China Initiative , wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland on September 9 , 2021 : \u201c the China Initiative disproportionally targets researchers of Chinese origin .\nPublicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered not by any evidence of wrongdoing , but just because of a researcher \u2019 s connections with China.\n\u201d In response to complaints from Asian American and other academic groups , some Democratic congress members urged the justice department to investigate \u201c the repeated , wrongful targeting of individuals of Asian descent for alleged espionage .\n.\n.\n\u201d Their letterreminded the department of America \u2019 s long history of anti-Asian prejudice and its contemporary consequences\u2014the increased violence against people of Asian ethnicity on city streets .\nWhat they failed to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Trump and Biden administrations that had prompted the violence .\nStill , the letter gives voice to the view of Chinese researchers in the United States , including those with American citizenship , who believe they are being targeted for having any connection with China , however ordinary .\nScientists have also voiced their concerns .\nAs one group put it , while the government has a legitimate need to tighten rules governing research security , \u201c a response that chokes off legitimate scientific contacts only compounds the problem it seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chinese and US researchers\u2014the justice department report cited above contains a full listing\u2014these scientists wrote that \u201c many of those now accused are accomplished scientists engaged in university research in fundamental science , with close collaborations in China.\n\u201d Putting Chinese science students under scrutiny , the group added , defied the facts and \u201c could deprive our country of some of its most talented future scientists.\n\u201d Fact is , exchanges with China benefit the US as much as they benefit China .\nThey bring language and cultural training to K-12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students staff laboratories and medical research facilities working , for example , on cancer .\nTheir research produces patents valued in the billions of dollars .\nTheir tuition and other costs of study are a major source of revenue for universities and colleges , measured in the billions of dollars .\n( \u201c Every 1,000 Ph.D. students blocked in a year from U.S. universities costs an estimated $ 210 billion in the expected value of patents produced at universities over 10 years and nearly $ 1 billion in lost tuition over a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Foundation for American Policy.\n\u201d Their time spent in the US exposes Chinese to the virtues of free expression , cross-cultural awareness , independent research , and respect for human rights .\nThe overwhelming endorsement of these exchanges by everyone from university administrators to small-town teachers reflects a positive aspect of US engagement with China that should be honored .\nFailure to do so leads to reciprocal punitive action by China , as seen in crackdowns on US social media and journalists there , the closure of once-thriving joint educational programs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origins of COVID-19 .\nThe bottom line is that restricting scientific collaboration stifles innovation and undermines the very competitiveness that President Biden is depending on for US economic recovery .\nAs Caroline Wagner , who specializes in exchange programs , writes : The US government \u2019 s scrutiny of Chinese Americans and Chinese scholars runs up against the value of open scientific exchange .\nMy research on international collaboration in science has shown that open nations have strong science .\nNations that accept visitors and send researchers abroad , those that engage richly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce better science and excel in innovation .\nClosing doors inhibits the very trait that makes the US innovation system the envy of the world .\nThe department of justice has prosecuted some Chinese and a few Americans who do indeed seem to have stepped over the line in their research .\nBut some people have been released for lack of evidence and others have failed to report ties to China rather than committed economic or security espionage .\nMoreover , the numbers of accused are miniscule when placed beside the tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans who abide by US law and have no political motive for being here .\nThose people should be considered an asset and treated with respect .\nAs the Stanford faculty \u2019 s letter says , \u201c Many of our most challenging global problems , including climate change & sustainability and current & future pandemics , require international engagement .\nWithout an open and inclusive environment that attracts the best talents in all areas , the United States can not retain its world leading position in science and technology.\n\u201d In recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent has come from China and the rest of Asia .\nIt is particularly disappointing that the Biden administration has taken Trump \u2019 s road , failing to distinguish China \u2019 s harmful behavior from its cooperative behavior .\nOur schools , our economy , and our society suffer the consequences .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below

their interview rounds with the host , Fran Kelly .\nWe enter a time warp , speeding away into another dimension where planet Earth , and Australia , look different .\nThe first interview , with Nationals Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of rejigged reality that is less mind expansion than contraction .\nIt is easy to forget that she is a member of the government .\nShe tells listeners that her constituents and the electorate she represented were not interested in climate change or its effects .\nA bold , quixotic reading .\nThey were also the \u201c most marginalised \u201d and vulnerable in Australia .\nThis would be a fascinating take for those in the employ of Rio Tinto and other mining giants .\nMcKenzie ( \u201c Fran , Fran , Fran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was all for those in rural areas , claiming that , \u201c We have been able to avoid very bad outcomes for our country.\n\u201d Environmental catastrophe , imminent impoverishment of the farming sector due to climate change , are evidently palatable and digestible outcomes .\nInterest , suggested McKenzie , should instead be shown for those workers who , in erecting solar panels , ended up mowing the grass underneath them .\nMuch of what the Senator said had already been given an airing in The Australian on October 10 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia , National Farmers Federation and the Minerals of Council had wobbled on the issue of \u201c net-zero emissions \u201d and how embracing such a policy would \u201c hit our regional export industries , and people living in the lowest socio-economic electorates in the country \u201d .\nShe proudly admitted that her party had been \u201c intransigent during this long debate \u201d , making them unpopular as dinner-party guests .\n\u201c We have been doing our job for the people who sent us to Canberra.\n\u201d Praise was heaped upon the environmental vandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carbon tax ; we have overseen record growth in mining and agricultural exports ; and we have pushed for technology solutions , while remaining committed to being careful stewards of the Earth.\n\u201d With stewards like these , who needs genuine ecological criminals ?\nThe second interview does little to steady listeners .\nIt is with a minister whose portfolio , at least in Australia , has been emptied of all meaning , let alone relevance .\nA little time with Environment Minister Sussan Ley , and you can be reassured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Morrison government is at the forefront of conservation efforts , and that Australia is the greenest of citizens .\nSuch views can be expressed alongside the fact that Australia has one of the highest extinction rates of species in the world .\nThese morning encounters with the climate change dinosaurs form the backdrop of whether Australia will even send its prime minister to COP26 .\nGoing to Glasgow has become as fascinating for the press and pundits as the fact that a climate conference is taking place .\nMorrison has even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal \u2019 s merits to the point of bringing in a lump to show fellow parliamentarians \u2013 that he has \u201c signalled his own climate conversion \u201d .\nThe evidence ?\nRemarks made in February 2020 at the National Press Club that \u201c our goal is to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible , and preferably by 2050 \u201d .\nHardly a conversion .\nA fairer portrayal of this is the fact that Morrison is finding himself being mugged by an increasingly unpleasant , even horrific reality .\nHe has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Coalition partners who function in the narrowest belt of reality but has found it mightily difficult .\nThe Nationals remain proud of their efforts in killing off prime ministers and their plans , be it the emissions trading scheme , the National Energy Guarantee , or the carbon tax .\nEnvironmental ideas , it has been known for a long time , go to the Nationals party room to die , along with their defenders .\nTo be convinced about the merits of \u201c net zero \u201d , party members will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly known as the Treasury .\nThe price for one of them , Keith Pitt , current Minister for Resources and Northern Australia , is a AU $ 250 billion publicly funded \u201c loan facility \u201d for the mining sector .\nFor McKenzie , it is an undertaking that targets be suspended in the event regional areas were harmed .\nPitt \u2019 s suggestion , given a nudge along by Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce , is all the more remarkable for what it entails : a massive public subsidising of the fossil fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn investment .\nSenator Matt Canavan , has defended this version of fossil fuel socialism .\n\u201c Global banks that want to control who has a job in Australia should be locked out of our country.\n\u201d By all means , let Australians \u201c pay higher interest rates but that would be worth it to protect our independence \u201d .\nThis , despite his constant clamouring that \u201c net zero means higher energy prices for all \u201d .\nThere would also be a delicious irony to this , given that such a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s current bugbear of choice , the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nEven as the Australian government beds itself firmly down with the United States for any future conflict with Beijing , such a transfer of cash , as Michael West points out , would benefit gas pipelines operator Jemena and Alinta Energy , and Yancoal Australia and coalminer CITIC Australia .\nAnd that \u2019 s just a small spread of potential beneficiaries .\nAs things stand , it is a wonder Prime Minister Scott Morrison is even bothering .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be poorly briefed , confused and barely able .\nThe coalition government , still weighed down by fossil-fuel fantasists , will continue to be engaged in a battle of such stunning incoherence any undertakings on carbon neutrality and change can only be regarded as unreliable and disingenuous .\nAs McKenzie and a few of her lobotomised colleagues would have you believe , climate change is something that happens to other people .\nIn the meantime , fossil fuel socialists the world over , unite !\nNote to readers : Please click the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on Instagram , @ crg_globalresearch .\nForward this article to your email lists .\nCrosspost on your blog site , internet

flatten the curve \u201d , which could have meant versions of all the above .\nThis created a climate of numerical sensitivity : a few case infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would warrant immediate , sharp lockdowns , stay-at-home orders , the closure of all non-vital service outlets .\nThen came mutations and variants .\nDelta became the word mentioned like a terrorist saboteur , placing bombs under the edifice of the health system .\nThe pro-market factions within governments receptive to using lockdown formulas could claim that harsh stay-at-home rules were not working .\nIt was time to open up the economy ; time to live with the virus , and , consequently , a good number of deaths .\nIt was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nA crucial factor to this was the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines and the acceleration of vaccination programs .\nStudies showing how increased vaccination coverage would reduce cases of COVID-19 and precipitate a fall in hospitalisation began to catch the attention of policy makers .\nOne , a preprint and yet to be peer-reviewed paper from August , looked at the effects of vaccination coverage among the 112 most populous counties in the United States .\nIt found that a 10 percent increase in vaccination coverage could be associated with a 28.3 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 16.6 percent decrease in COVID-19 hospitalisations per 100 cases .\nIn Australia , New South Wales became the first state to accept that a lockdown policy coupled with a mass vaccination push , the stress being on the latter , would be necessary to cope with the ravages of the Delta variant .\nEventually , the number of infections would fall , as they now seem to be doing .\n\u201c What we need to do is all of us have to start accepting that we need to live with COVID because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years , \u201d the now departed Premier Gladys Berejiklian stated in September .\nBut it was less a stance of wisdom than one of necessity , given the initially carefree approach of the Berejiklian government to staying open despite the dangers posed by new variants .\n\u201c We have to live with the virus , \u201d meant not having to say sorry .\nVictoria followed , digesting a harsh reality that the virus , active and present , had ceased to be ineradicable .\nIt had not been that long ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had \u201c run the virus \u201d into the ground like an unwanted

seems to be everywhere , fighting the poor cause .\nAt the very least , he is everywhere with the press cameras , the niggling concerns , the irritations that make it into the twenty-four-hour news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the perfect ingredient in a stew of conflict , the agitator , the irritant .\nThe range of issues that have seen his intervention have taken him to conservative , often reactionary fora , the world over .\nHe has given a gloss of legitimacy to the Great Replacement theory , worried that Christian Europeans have somehow forgotten how to breed , including members of the British Royal Family .\nHe has been praised by Hungary \u2019 s Viktor Orb\u00e1n for defending Western civilisation against the dark and swarthy .\nHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwinian model in containing COVID-19 , advising governments that the elderly are dispensable citizens .\nHe has sold his brutal \u201c turn back the boats \u201d formula to European states with , it has to be said , some success .\nThe United Kingdom and Denmark , for instance , are increasingly aping his stance in lifting the drawbridge and detaining those seeking asylum .\nThen , it was time for the ironman pugilist to pay a visit to Taiwan , something he considered a duty to do and must have had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod of approval from Canberra .\n\u201c Taiwan \u2019 s friends are so important right now.\n\u201d He went , not as a peace envoy but as a representative flagging future conflict .\nAbbott \u2019 s October 8 address to the Yushan forum began with an admission .\nTwo years ago , he had hesitated to attend the conference , \u201c lest that provoke China.\n\u201d But since then \u2013 and here , Abbott keeps company with the war drummers in Canberra \u2013 China had altered the facts .\nBeijing had shredded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , placed a million Uighurs into concentration camps , increased cyber surveillance of its own citizens , embraced a its own cancel culture \u201c in favour of a cult of the new red emperor \u201d , attacked Indian soldiers , coerced rival claimants in its eastern seas and \u201c flown evermore intimidatory sorties against Taiwan.\n\u201d Much of this is true enough , though Abbott minimises the aggravations .\nChina \u2019 s \u201c weaponised trade \u201d against Australia was only because Canberra had \u201c politely \u201d sought an \u201c impartial inquiry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all led him to believe that \u201c China \u2019 s belligerence is all self-generated.\n\u201d It wasn \u2019 t always like that .\nAbbott told his audience of how his government \u201c finalised China \u2019 s first free trade deal with another G20 country , in part , because we thought that would help us build trust between China and the democracies.\n\u201d His government also readied to join the Chinese-led Asia Infrastructure Investment bank as he \u201c thought it would help to give China a stake in a rules-based global order.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ global order \u201d is bound to be hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of global politics , where power is exerted with lofty ambition and justified in the language of noble refrain .\nBut for Abbott , there is an inherent decency to such rules , even if they were , historically speaking , imposed on non-white nations of the planet in a civilising mission of some brutality .\nAnd such rules can be broken , as evidenced by Abbott \u2019 s own remarks about Taiwan \u2019 s accepted international status , which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why would they want to get caught up in the old arguments about who is the \u2018 real \u2019 China ?\n\u201d he asks about the Taiwanese \u2013 except that the seat of government of the \u201c real \u201d China remains in Beijing , with the assumption that Taiwan will , eventually , join the PRC .\nAustralia had behaved , according to Abbott , entirely appropriately despite becoming an unquestioning satellite of US power in the Indo-Pacific with a promise of acquiring nuclear-powered submarines .\n\u201c If the \u2018 drums of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an official of ours has noted , it \u2019 s not Australia that \u2019 s beating them.\n\u201d The only beating of drums , he insisted

and follow us on Instagram at @ crg_globalresearch .\nI read a stimulating essay recently co-authored by Paul Dolan , professor at the London School of Economics , and his research assistant Amanda Hedwood analysing , against the backdrop of the uncertainties of the Covid-19 pandemic , how dominant narratives powerfully influence decisions and create the \u2018 narrative trap \u2019 in decision-making .\n\u201c We contend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the impact of narratives will impede effective decision-making by leaving the decision-maker open to unspecified and unrecognised bias .\nNarratives are not good or bad in themselves , but their ability to make some decisions appear more appealing than others\u2014often in ways that lie below our conscious awareness\u2014is detrimental to effective decision-making.\n\u201d Any Indian would know that powerful narratives envelop India \u2019 s deeply troubled relationships with Pakistan and China .\nThe dominant narratives have become the means through which successive governments strove to assert values and identities .\nYet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way things ought to be .\nThey may help make decisions easier for leaderships that lack erudition but the consequences of such decisions can be deleterious .\nThe spurious reasons to act in a particular way in Doklam in 2017 are a case in point today .\nThe \u2018 roadmap \u2019 signed by Bhutan and China on Thursday towards resolving their longstanding boundary dispute has put a hole through India \u2019 s Doklam narrative through which an elephant can pass .\nDelhi \u2019 s muted reaction betrays bewilderment mixed with suppressed fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Army crossed into Chinese territory across the settled Sikkim border to thwart PLA \u2019 s road building in an area that Bhutan claimed belonged to it .\nThe Indian and Chinese troops withdrew from Doklam following a 73-day stalemate , but satellite images subsequently showed that the Chinese military infrastructure in the region has now been put on a permanent footing .\nBut Delhi preferred to look away .\nSo , what was all that narrative all about \u2014 that Bhutan requested Delhi to come to its defence and India valiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denouement to the Doklam crisis was one of the finest hours of Indian diplomacy , et al ?\nAre we to conclude that the entire narrative was actually a load of garbage ?\nNow comes the bombshell of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Three-Step Roadmap for Expediting the Bhutan-China Boundary Negotiations .\nThimpu apparently didn \u2019 t think it necessary to take Delhi into confidence .\nSimply put , Bhutan is loathe to getting dragged into the geopolitical rivalry between India and China .\nAnd for Beijing , of course , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed to thumb its nose at the powers-that-be in Delhi .\nA scathing commentary in CGTN concluded : \u201c The biggest lesson of the MoU for New Delhi ought to be that initiatives such as the Quad and anti-China metrics can not reverse India \u2019 s growing isolation in South Asia.\n\u201d The problem with contrived narratives such as on Doklam in 2017 is that they can lead to situational blindness , whereby you are so focused on one aspect that you fail to notice the bigger picture .\nA similar thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delhi revoked the autonomy granted to J & K and thereafter followed it up by issuing a new map of India .\nHardly six month later , the Chinese and Indian troops engaged in aggressive melee , face-offs and skirmishes at locations along the Sino-Indian border , including in Ladakh .\nAn impasse has appeared lately and the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh has stalled .\nInterestingly , the announcement of the signing of the China-Bhutan MOU comes four days after the 13th round of India-China Corps Commander Level Meeting .\nTo be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the decision-makers in Delhi to rebalance the impact of their dominant narratives that might have initially enhanced the attractiveness of their decisions .\nThe proclivity to focus on immediate effects over delayed ones led to a situational blindness .\nThe heart of the matter is that Indian narratives simply ignore the country \u2019 s numerous lethal weaknesses .\nConsequently , our self-serving , reassuring narratives potentially influence our behaviour .\nBut emotional states of mind preclude rational thinking .\nConsider the following : India just had a precipitous fall in the Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a list of 116 countries , from the 94th position last year .\nShockingly , India is now behind its neighbours Pakistan , Bangladesh and Nepal .\nThis news appeared only yesterday .\nYet , a former National Security Advisor has written today , \u201c In the longer term , if there is one country which , in terms of its size , population , economic potential , scientific and technical capabilities , can match or even surpass China , it is India.\n\u201d The problem with such bluster is almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dead , as John Keynes , the great British economist , once famously pointed out .\nTo be sure , the Indian narratives , be it on China or Pakistan , need balancing .\nOur narratives are far too comforting and alternative stories are needed to challenge them .\nThe risk lies in the sort of preference for stories we feel confident about \u2014 \u2018 a two-front war under the nuclear shadow \u2019 ; Quad ( \u2018 Indo-Pacific strategy \u2019 ) ; \u2018 engagement and competition \u2019 with China , et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stark Indian reality is no longer possible to hide .\nYet , at the moment , India is having a 15-day military exercise in Alaska , which US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin calls the \u2018 strategic hotspot \u2019 for the US \u2019 Indo-Pacific operations against China and the Arctic operations against Russia !\nIndia \u2019 s decision-makers should demand sense-making counter narratives to protect themselves from the power of one familiar narrative .\nCompeting narratives will help them to weigh evidence and optimally reach judgments .\nHad that been the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the foxhole today following the tumultuous events in Afghanistan .\nThe mother of all ironies is that the success ( or failure ) of the current Indian initiative to host an international conference on Afghanistan in November hinges critically on the acceptance of our invite by the Pakistani national security advisor !\nTo my mind , Moeed Yusuf will probably come , since Prime Minister Imran Khan is an ardent advocate of dialogue with India .\nBut then , what happens to our self-serving narrative about Pakistan if we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regional security and stability so as to influence the recalcitrant Taliban ( read Sirajuddin Haqqani ) to rein in terrorist groups ?\nConversely , what prevented us from responding to the Pakistani overtures in the recent years while Ashraf Ghani and his clique was ensconced in power in Kabul ?\nTherefore , we are currently on the job of creating a brand new narrative that India is navigating a \u2018 way to get a seat at the table to decide the future \u2019 of Afghanistan .\nAnd this when our decision-makers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would show up at our conference in November .\nCombating a dominant narrative is not easy , but history shows \u2014 be it about Hitler or George W Bush \u2014 that most such stories do not have a happy ending .\nOn the other hand , as the LSE scholars wrote , they can potentially inflict large-scale costs when the decision-makers allow themselves to be led by their own narratives and get blindsided in \u2018 uncertain and high stakes environments \u2019 .\nNote to readers : Please click the share

protesters is growing .\nPolice first deployed non-lethal weapons in August and have more recently used them against protesters , including at the War Memorial on September 22 .\nThe non-lethal weapons include foam baton rounds , which are foam-tipped bullets deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls , cylindrical balls containing an irritant powder that is dispersed on impact .\nVictoria Police used a semi-automatic weapon to shoot these , as well as pellets containing dye , to be able to identify the person for arrest .\nStinger grenades are also being used .\nThese are rolled into a crowd to explode with light and smoke , also releasing nine rubber bullets that disperse to waist height with a range of five metres .\nSue Bolton , Socialist Alliance councillor on Moreland City Council , condemned the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police using such weapons at any protest .\n\u201c The police have a record of using extreme violence against protesters , especially those who can be portrayed as unpopular , to try to get public support for their operations , which include more lethal weapons \u201d , she told Green Left .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t support the anti-vaccination/anti-lockdown protests , but neither do we support police violence against protests.\n\u201d While some anti-vaccination/anti-lockdown protesters were violent , instances of unprovoked police violence were also witnessed .\nA video of an unprovoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station on September 22 showed excessive force being used by police .\nThe offending officer is under investigation and has been stood down pending the investigation .\nOther extraordinary measures taken by police include stopping public transport to central Melbourne between 8am and 2pm on September 18 .\nThis is not the first time .\nIn 2016 , the police stopped tram services heading to Coburg in an effort to prevent people attending an anti-racism rally , organised by Bolton along with local residents .\nOn September 22 , police instructed the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airspace over the protesters a \u201c restricted zone \u201d .\nThe reason given was that the protesters may be able to monitor aerial live-streams and compromise police operations , thereby posing a \u201c safety risk \u201d .\nThe decision was reversed after journalists questioned whether police wanted to avoid scrutiny of their interactions with protesters .\nThere is little public sympathy for the anti-vaccination/anti-lockdown protesters and the police are pushing to justify their use of such weapons against the public .\nFormer Victoria Police riot squad head Jeff Mawkes told the Herald Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to use water cannons , and more , on the anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown protesters .\n\u201c Sometimes you \u2019 ve got to think outside the square \u2026 My gut feeling is to bring out the tear gas and give it to them.\n\u201d The police have other crowd dispersal weapons , such as the controversial long range acoustic device weapon , which emits a high-frequency sound that temporarily disables those in its vicinity by causing nausea and hearing impairment .\n\u201c Right now , Victoria Police is using weapons on a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they have a history of using violence against peaceful protesters , such as the Blockade IMARC rally in 2019 \u201d , Bolton said .\n\u201c After lockdown and as inequality rises , it is likely that the police will deploy the same weapons against people protesting against the end of the disaster payment , for a higher rate of JobSeeker or for real action on the climate .\nWe need to

group of US military trainers has been in Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming that the revelations were made after \u201c provocative \u201d moves made by Beijing .\nHowever this is not true .\nIt was actually reported on as soon as it happened late last year .\nThe Diplomat in a November 2020 article titled , \u201c US Marine Raiders Arrive in Taiwan to Train Taiwanese Marines , \u201d would cite Taiwanese media as revealing the US deployment .\nIt was also noted that US forces had not stepped foot on Taiwan since 1979 .\nAlso last year , the Pentagon would deny this deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Pentagon spokesman John Supple told Marine Corps Times in a Tuesday email .\n\u201c The United States remains committed to our One-China Policy based on the three Joint Communiques , Taiwan Relations Act , and Six Assurances.\n\u201d Pentagon spokesman John Supple \u2019 s reference to the three Joint Communiques , the Taiwan Relations Act , and the Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s recognition of the One China Policy .\nUS troops had fully withdrawn from Taiwan in the 1970s and until now have not returned because it was in the 1970s that the United States along with virtually every other nation on Earth broke off official recognition of the Republic of China ( ROC ) government based in Taipei , recognized one single China including Taiwan , and officially recognized one government of China , based in Beijing \u2013 that of the People \u2019 s Republic of China ( PRC ) .\nDespite multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Australian governments recognizing this official position in regards to Taiwan \u2019 s status , the vast majority of the Western public still believe that Taiwan is an independent country that China is \u201c bullying.\n\u201d The US State Department \u2019 s official website under its Office of the Historian has published the full text of the Shanghai Communique , the first of the three Joint Communiques mentioned by John Supple in his statement last year .\nIn the communique it states : The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China .\nThe United States Government does not challenge that position .\nIt reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves .\nWith this prospect in mind , it affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all US forces and military installations from Taiwan .\nIn the meantime , it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes .\nThe Australian government also officially recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian government \u2019 s official website on a page titled , \u201c Australia-Taiwan relationship , \u201d it unambiguously states : The Australian Government continued to recognise Taipei until the establishment of diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1972 .\nAustralia \u2019 s Joint Communiqu\u00e9 with the PRC recognised the Government of the PRC as China \u2019 s sole legal government , and acknowledged the position of the PRC that Taiwan was a province of the PRC .\nDespite these plainly stated facts , the Western media and Western governments themselves have deliberately misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent country and that China is \u201c bullying \u201d it .\nIn one breath , commentators will claim Taiwan is a \u201c democratic country , \u201d while in the next claim that Taiwan declaring its \u201c independence \u201d is imminent .\nLeft unexplained is how an independent democratic country could declare independence , declare independence from whom , and why they would need to in the first place .\nAt face value the narrative is a contradiction , but like so much of what the West does geopolitically , its narrative regarding Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies aimed at preying on the public emotionally , diverting attention away from contradictions , and in the case of the One China Policy , simply omitting it from public discussion .\nConsidering the United States \u2019 official stance on Taiwan , its placement of US forces on Taiwan is essentially a de facto invasion and occupation of Chinese territory .\nBeijing surely reads Taiwanese as well as Western headlines \u2013 if its intelligence apparatus was somehow unaware of last year \u2019 s US military deployment \u2013 and despite the highly provocative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been infinite patience and geopolitical maturity .\nEven its \u201c invasion of Taiwanese airspace \u201d was the product of Western propaganda rather than any genuine act of aggression .\nTaiwan \u2019 s own Ministry of National Defense admits that Chinese warplanes passed through what Taiwan administrators claim is Taiwan \u2019 s air defense identification zone ( ADIZ ) .\nADIZs are not recognized under international law , are unilaterally declared , and are established outside a nation \u2019 s recognized sovereign airspace , not in it .\nIn Taiwan \u2019 s case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own , but even if it did , Chinese warplanes were far from it even according to Taiwan \u2019 s own admissions , operating in what is internationally recognized as international airspace .\nThus the highly reserved actions and words of Beijing came after , not before revelations of America \u2019 s provocative military deployment .\nJacob Helberg , an \u201c adjunct fellow \u201d of the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , who includes among its sponsors the governments of the US , Taiwan , and Japan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed online during an interview with Breaking Points the reasoning behind the positioning of US troops in Taiwan despite Washington \u2019 s obvious recognition of the One China Policy .\nHelberg would claim it was to prevent China from using force without creating a more convincing pretext for the US to militarily intervene .\nThe presence of US troops would create less favorable conditions for China to act .\nHelberg also noted the prospect of the current Democratic Progressive Party-led government in Taiwan declaring \u201c independence \u201d despite simultaneously claiming Taiwan was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly be a decision made without US consultation and approval along with assurances of protection .\nThe chess pieces have certainly been put in place ahead of any potential \u201c declaration of independence , \u201d but whether this happens still depends on what countermoves are made by Beijing as well as other external factors that may still enter into US calculus .\nThe Economic Reality of Integration vs. the Fevered Dreams of \u201c Independence \u201d An argument often floated by the Western media in defense of the collective encouragement of Taiwan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of belligerence toward Beijing is ; if the people of Taiwan choose independence , why should anyone stop them ?\nOmitted are all the arguments the West made when Crimea voted to rejoin Russia in 2014 involving claims of external coercion and influence .\nIn Taiwan \u2019 s case , the US actually is clearly involved in shaping the opinions of the Taiwanese population as well as directing the moves of the current government .\nThe Taiwanese are not arriving at the decision to pursue independence on their own nor as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite the contrary .\nTaiwan \u2019 s economy is dependent on and partially integrated with the Chinese mainland .\nOver 40 % of all Taiwanese exports go to either mainland China or Hong Kong and the vast majority of its trade resides in the wider Asian region .\nThe Chinese mainland also accounts for most of Taiwan \u2019 s imports at 21 % as of 2019 with Japan in second place at 16 % .\nInvestments across the strait are also significant .\nDespite the stance of Taipei regarding Beijing , Taiwan \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mainland China and vice versa .\nA \u201c declaration of independence \u201d by Taiwan would at the very least cause China to constrict economic flow to and from Taiwan , strangling the economy and undermining the government responsible for provoking Beijing in ways a military assault on the island could never achieve .\nThe United States has neither the means nor the time to create alternatives for Taiwan \u2019 s economy and markets in the quickly closing window of opportunity left before China irreversibly surpasses the US economically and militarily , rending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island moot , and allowing Beijing wide leeway for action to reintegrate the wayward province .\nUS provocations including the now unprecedented deployment of US troops in Taiwan and those within the Taiwanese administration aiding and abetting them threaten the current status quo which includes the smooth , incremental integration of Taiwan into a growing , prosperous mainland China .\nThe current status quo represents the \u201c peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question \u201d as agreed to by the US government itself with Beijing in its communiques .\nThe issue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan \u2019 s best interest or Beijing \u2019 s , but rather Washington \u2019 s .\nAnd it is based on this actual

on drugs to its fight against terrorism and the lingering communist insurgency , the Duterte administration has exhibited a steadfast resolve to address the Philippines \u2019 security challenges .\nOne striking observation is its heavy dependence on the armed forces to accomplish its security goals , albeit at great cost to the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial law era , this military role expansion now includes leading the COVID-19 response .\nThe country is said to have the longest militarized pandemic lockdown in the world .\nFavoring military officers for their apparent efficiency and obedience , by 2017 , Duterte has the greatest number of retired generals in any presidential cabinet in the post-dictatorship period .\nAlthough former military officials usually lead defense and security institutions ( such as the Department of National Defense ) in practice , the Duterte administration distinguishes itself by also appointing them to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social welfare ; even the office in charge of the peace process .\nThere is little doubt that this intimate relationship between the military and their commander-in-chief comes when both are very popular with the Filipino public , despite criticisms from the country \u2019 s stalwarts of liberal democracy , such as the opposition , media , and civil society .\nThe imbalance in Philippine civil-military relations is another indicator of the country \u2019 s democracy \u2019 s ongoing erosion that got worse since Duterte \u2019 s rise to power .\nThis status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsening external perceptions .\nJust recently , a London-based think tank classified it as a \u201c flawed democracy.\n\u201d Simultaneously , a US government intelligence report has identified Duterte himself as a threat to democracy in Southeast Asia .\nThe country \u2019 s state of civil-military relations exposes a dangerous resurgence of the military \u2019 s undue influence in Southeast Asia \u2019 s politics .\nThis has been seen in Thailand , Indonesia , and recently , in Myanmar \u2019 s military coup .\nGiven the steady pace of Philippine democracy \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot that could happen with the remaining 15 months of the Duterte administration .\nIts ironclad alliance with a military bent on achieving its first total victory against a historical enemy : the world \u2019 s longest Maoist-inspired communist insurgency , is worth watching .\nRegardless of the outcome , the military \u2019 s gambit might have far-reaching negative consequences to the state and society which it has sworn to protect and defend .\nAt present , the Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) is enjoying a much more improved reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may attribute this to Duterte \u2019 s exaltation and constant praise of the institution , a major factor has been its reformist and modernizing stance in the past decade .\nSince 2010 the Philippine government has embarked on a security sector reform ( SSR ) to improve the military \u2019 s effectiveness and accountability .\nSSR is a major principle stated in the country \u2019 s National Security Policy since the Benigno Aquino III Administration .\nThis push for professionalism and democratic accountability by the country \u2019 s civilian leadership coupled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public trust and confidence in the military .\nA December 2019 poll ( below ) revealed that the AFP enjoyed its highest trust ratings since public opinion polling began .\nAn astounding 79 % of Filipinos trust the military .\nNet trust ratings of the Philippine military , 1993-2019 by Social Weather Stations ( All rights reserved ) The steady improvement of the military \u2019 s image among Filipinos was a by-product of its openness to embrace reform and substantive professionalism .\nAmong others , this included setting up human rights offices across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transformation roadmap with the guidance of reputable members of the civilian bureaucracy , academe , media , and civil society , and cooperating with politicians to deal with peace and development challenges at the local level .\nDue to the challenges of territorial defense and the country \u2019 s stake in the South China Sea disputes , the last decade saw the military repositioning itself to be more externally oriented through the concept of a credible \u201c Self-Reliant Defense Posture.\n\u201d As an addition to the military \u2019 s doctrine , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make it a professional armed force focused on the republic \u2019 s external defense and security .\nNo president in the country \u2019 s post-martial law history has favored the military than Duterte .\nIt is not coincidental that once the firebrand leader decided to put his unconditional trust and confidence with the armed forces , things negatively affected Philippine democracy .\nAs more and more members of the military ( active or retired ) fused themselves with the administration , the more it became more difficult to balance civil-military relations democratically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Duterte administration has exerted over Philippine democracy .\nNever has there been a time in the country where the president has control over all branches of government given the administration \u2019 s \u201c super-majority \u201d in the legislature .\nMajority of the magistrates in the nation \u2019 s Supreme Court are also Duterte appointees .\nHis consolidation of power has attracted the military to embark on a partnership that defies a model of civil-military relations where democratic principles and norms , primarily civilian oversight and accountability , have taken a back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts even replaced left-leaning officials endorsed by the country \u2019 s communist movement , a complete reversal of the more accommodating stance of the populist leader at the beginning of his presidency .\nSome see the value of putting retired generals in political positions \u2013 they are more efficient , strategic , quicker to respond , and were socialized to obey their commander-in-chief .\nAnyone familiar with Philippine governance knows that delay , paralysis , and bureaucratic politics are the policy process \u2019 s maladies .\nAs former military officials , now considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many see their experience as an asset to Duterte \u2019 s government .\nHowever , the \u201c civilianization \u201d of the generals is at best only in form .\nDespite all efforts to portray themselves as civilians , soldiers retain that scholars of civil-military relations call \u201c the military mind.\n\u201d Decades of socialization and practice formed a mental map with a different perspective on political affairs \u2013 one that is far less simple , limited , and categorical .\nThis is also shaped by the country \u2019 s specific historical experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics and decided the legitimacy of civilian governments .\nGenerals also do not lose their networks and connections within the military world .\nAs observed , every one of them brought other military officials ( often fellow retirees who were their subordinates ) in every government institution they lead .\nThis multiplier effect not only leads to groupthink in decision-making but also exacts a toll on the development of civilian expertise in the government \u2019 s already weakened bureaucracy .\nIt becomes problematic when civilian leaders like to invite and encourage the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and implementation of security policies .\nSources from inside the Duterte administration have observed that there is a lack of diverse perspectives in peace and security policy circles and a complete absence of contentious debate ( which is critical to arriving at a satisfactory policy outcome ) because military officers are trained to focus on immediate responses to perceived crises and are not used to prolonged deliberation .\nIn a very complicated policy area such as peace and security , a government whose most dominant voice comes from the military might settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complex issues .\nThis is seen in the country \u2019 s pandemic response so far .\nThe militarized nature of the policies imposed by Duterte \u2019 s government has failed to appreciate the critical public health and human security dimensions of the pandemic .\nIts heavy-handed and punitive approach are often not grounded on complex science and empirical evidence that should guide public policy .\nNow or never : The military \u2019 s anti-communist purge As Duterte assumed the military \u2019 s padrino ( godfather ) role , the guard rails normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic \u2019 s guardians started to corrode .\nThe military \u2019 s top-brass , both active and retired , began to shift their attention to its historical enemy \u2013 the communist movement .\nAn executive decree signed by the president in 2018 seeks to \u201c end local communist armed conflict \u201d by the end of Duterte \u2019 s term in 2022 .\nThis unconditional order aligned with the military \u2019 s enduring interest to score a final victory against their communist nemesis since it knows that future presidents might not share the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nation \u201d approach , this heavily-funded counter-insurgency strategy seeks to mobilize all relevant stakeholders within the government and even society through collaborative efforts .\nHowever , a closer look at its implementation reveals that this approach is dictated by elements of the military establishment .\nThe approach has been distorted to one wherein all of society must go behind the military \u2019 s leadership .\nThe Duterte administration \u2019 s inability to impose democratic civilian control has put the military in the driver seat of this anti-communist drive .\nWith both retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing this , the military is determined to put a violent rather than negotiated end to perhaps the longest running Maoist-inspired communist insurgency in the world .\nTherefore , it is not surprising that the military went full-throttle in its McCarthy-like campaign against an insurgency that they believe has penetrated all sectors of society .\nThough historically seen as rebels with a cause , the communist movement is now labeled as a terrorist group , a term the government used to reserve for jihadists and other religious extremists .\nAmid a crippling pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draconian anti-terrorist law that further legally empowered the state to designate terrorists , conduct surveillance , freeze assets , and detain those they believe are terrorists in a process that jeopardized constitutionally-guaranteed rights .\nThe latest move of the military is to target academic institutions , notably the country \u2019 s national university : the University of the Philippines ( UP ) , due to its allegation that it has become a hub for communist recruitment .\nUP has played a key role in the anti-Marcos struggle but also has produced leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the defense department has unilaterally abrogated a three-decades-old agreement on the conduct of military operations in the eight campuses of UP .\nThis was seen as a brash move with little regard for the mutual respect and good faith built between the academic community and the military .\nDespite the strong condemnation from Filipino academic institutions , there is no sign that the Department of National Defense will reinstate its accord with UP .\nWhile both parties to the revoked agreement have initiated talks , the military has entered university campuses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d of members of the UP community .\nIt is highly improbable that a new accord that will respect or enhance the academic freedom of educational institutions will be forged under the Duterte administration .\nIn the end , the military has little regard to casting a wide net on whom they consider to be enemies of the state , even if it includes the institution whose mandate has been to produce many of the nation \u2019 s best and brightest .\nAcademic freedom has become the latest casualty in this \u201c scorched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communism \u2013 an ideology not banned by the 1987 Constitution \u2013 but one that the Duterte government has successfully linked with lawless violence and crime .\nIn doing so , it has not exercised caution in labelling dissidents and critics as communists themselves or as their sympathizers .\nThis has a chilling effect on the nation \u2019 s academic institutions \u2019 ability to critically think , study , and analyze important matters , which inevitably includes how the Duterte administration is governing a country it promised to serve and protect .\nWithout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare , the Duterte administration has embraced the armed as a political partner despite the constitutional principle of civilian supremacy over the military .\nThis relationship has blurred the critical boundaries between civilian authority and the military establishment .\nDuterte has given the military everything it wants in terms of perks , resources , and political patronage .\nWithout limited civilian control , he has allowed the military to lead , without civilian supervision , peace and security policy .\nFinally , the populist president has tolerated a military to generally act with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people , rather than defending the state against its enemies abroad .\nWhat will it profit the military if it defeats its enemies but forfeits the country \u2019 s soul in exchange ?\nThe military has reciprocated Duterte \u2019 s favor by defending the authoritarian leader \u2019 s rhetoric and policies .\nWith very few exceptions , members of the armed forces have rallied around the administration , even if its policies in the long-run can undermine military professionalism and modernization .\nThis can also harm the credibility it presently enjoys .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ military officers \u2013 both active and retired \u2013 that their credibility and the military \u2019 s integrity are at stake when security forces are involved in politics .\nA politicized

itself with Duterte , his administration \u2019 s failure to fulfill its promises and expectations might lead to damaging repercussions for the military \u2019 s institutional reputation .\nThe costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be too high for the country .\nA democracy is in further danger when the military \u2019 s interests are threatened .\nTo know how they could react once Duterte relinquishes power to

September for presidency of the Liberal-Democratic Party ( and de facto Prime Minister ) and in October for Lower House of the Diet .\nThis paper argues that Kishida Fumio , victorious in the former and to contest the latter on 31 October , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the same key figures as the Abe and Suga governments of 2012-2021 and is likely to continue the same US-led anti-China policies , marked by substantial military expansion and multi-national military exercises drawing to the East China Sea warships of major countries including not only the United States but also Great Britain , France , Australia , even Germany .\nThis paper considers current trends and , while suggesting that significant change is not probable , nevertheless draws attention to a citizen-led challenge that could cause upset to the long-established LDP-dominated order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upheavals of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the COVID pandemic with two elections , for president of the Liberal-Democratic party on 29 September and for Lower House of the National Diet on 31 October .\nBoth will reflect , in one way or another , the fact that the two most recent Prime Ministers , Abe Shinzo ( 2012-2020 ) and Suga Yoshihide ( 2020-2021 ) signally failed to carry the country with them in the way they addressed the Games and the pandemic .\nThe ruling elite assumed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an era of peace and recovery ( from the 2011 Fukushima quake , tsunami , and nuclear meltdown and from the 2020-21 COVID pandemic ) and would clear the way to an LDP election triumph and a revamped constitution with the \u201c peace \u201d clause , Article 9 , deleted .\nHowever , things did not work out like that .\nEight years after assuring the international community in 2013 that it had the Fukushima problem \u201c under control \u201d Japan offered similar assurances that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d mode .\nBut as the Olympics peaked in the summer of 2021 the contradiction between the celebratory spirit of the former and the latter \u2019 s \u201c stay at home \u201d and \u201c three avoidances \u201d was palpable .\nSupport for Suga dropped from around 70 per cent in September 2020 to below 30 per cent in August 2021 .\nAloof and impervious to public criticism and demand , the miasma of scandal , deception , and corruption that Suga inherited in August 2020 steadily thickened during his year in office .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ became untenable .\nWhen he announced his decision not to stand for re-election as head of the Liberal-Democratic Party ( LDP ) in the party election , giving as reason his wish to devote himself fully to combating COVID , nobody believed him .\nThe government \u2019 s own pollsters reported that , in the event of an election the ruling LDP would haemorrhage seats and potentially lose government.1 In a Yokohama city mayoral election in August , an independent critic of government defeated a close associate of the Prime Minister by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent margin ) .\nWhen Suga announced that he would not be a candidate for re-election as president of the LDP ( and therefore as Prime Minister ) , he was bowing to democratic pressure .\nHe had become a liability to his own party and was in effect being sacked .\nBut change of personnel did not signify change of policy .\nIn the September 2021 election for successor to Suga , all four candidates were committed to continuation of the Abe-Suga government \u2019 s basic principles .\nThere is no alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the US .\nMajor projects such as that for construction of a Marine Corps base on Oura Bay ( at Henoko , Okinawa ) have absolute priority , irrespective of local opposition or cost or geological and seismic frailty of the site .\nAt Washington \u2019 s dictates , a military first , anti-China posture is unquestioned .\nIn September 2020 , when Suga Yoshihide succeeded Abe Shinzo as Prime Minister , along with most commentators I predicted that here would be little change , since Abe \u2019 s old regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state.2 Now that Suga has bowed out the year that has passed confirms that judgement .\nChosen on 29 September as party president by the one million members of the Japanese conservative Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , Kishida Fumio replaced Suga as Prime Minister-designate .\nBecause the LDP , with its ally , the neo-Buddhist Komeito , holds a parliamentary majority in the Japanese Diet , it means that the roughly one in 100 of the Japanese people who happen to belong to the LDP by choosing a party head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nHe then almost immediately called a general election .\nPassing the LDP Baton \u2013 Suga ( with flowers ) hands over to Kishida ( Asahi Shimbun , 29 September 2021 ) At the election , now scheduled for 31 October , the LDP can be expected to do well .\nIt always does .\nIt may only \u2013 according to the May Jiji poll enjoy the support of 32.2 per cent of eligible voters \u2013 far fewer than the 44.6 per cent who do not support it \u2013 but that should suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force honed by more than a half century of success,3 and because close to half the population will not vote.4Though a tiny minority in the country , LDP party members by these two elections will be settling the country \u2019 s course for the next several years , perhaps longer .\nLike Suga in 2020 , Kishida , former Foreign Minister and Defense Minister and core figure in Abe Shinzo governments from 2012 , is unlikely to chart any new course or to prove a popular choice .\nOpinion polls in the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 13 per cent and 18.5 per cent popular support , far below Kono Taro , the favorite , with 43 percent and 48.6 per cent respectively.5 Kono , an articulate figure on social media platforms , and a graduate of Georgetown University fluent in English , lacked the party old guard support , especially from the Abe camp.6 Kono \u2019 s hinting at a readiness to open formal investigation into Abe/Suga \u2019 s possibly criminal acts during office made him anathema to them and brought his bid to naught .\nThe paradoxical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be that the anti-LDP forces will be better able to mobilize to try to overthrow the Abe-Suga , now Abe-Suga-Kishida , government at the October Lower House election than would have been the case if Kono had been successful .\nFacing the September and October elections , I find myself wondering : is it possible that Japan \u2019 s more than half century of virtual one-party government might be approaching an end .\nThe Japanese state is built on foundations laid by the San Francisco treaty in 1951 and simultaneous Ampo agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the active interventions by US agencies including especially the CIA , in setting up and managing the apparatus of long-term US control , including the Self-Defense Forces ( SDF ) and the Liberal-Democratic Party , since then .\nThe SDF , \u201d set up in 1954 , has grown in the decades since then to one of the world \u2019 s most powerful militaries ( probably Number Five ) .7 The relationship established at San Francisco of US protector and Japan demilitarized and protected , however , has been steadily transformed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s military might is boosted and merged in US-led treaty and alliance forces , while the interpretation of \u201c Self Defense \u201d has grown ever looser , especially under the Abe and Suga governments ( 2012-2021 ) .\nFor decades Washington has been urging upon Japan a process of \u201c normalization.\n\u201d Japan under Abe responded by adopting in 2014 a new interpretation of Article 9 under which Japan could mobilize its self-defense forces when required for collective self-defense purposes ( i.e .\nsummoned by the US , as Japan \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emptying out the Japanese constitution , overcoming the current impediment ( as Japanese and American planners have long seen it ) of the pacifist Article 9 and turning Japan into an \u201c ordinary \u201d country , i.e .\na comprehensive military and general superpower able and willing to mobilize its forces in future \u201c Coalitions of the Willing.\n\u201d In 2015 , the Abe government adopted a package of security bills in accordance with this new interpretation .\nMuch to the embarrassment of the Abe government , in June that year three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify to the Diet , all pronounced them unconstitutional .\nDespite the fact of constitutional scholars overwhelmingly declaring this legislation unconstitutional , the laws were adopted and now define how Japan \u2019 s forces might behave in future conflict situations .\nOne of the last initiatives of the Abe government in 2020 was to initiate moves towards acquiring weapons capable of striking missile sites in enemy territory \u201c if an attack is imminent.\n\u201d 8 It would be hard to imagine any more egregious breach of the constitution \u2019 s Article 9 than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Trump and Joe Biden , the US calls on Japan to become a full US partner and linchpin in the China-containing and confronting four-sided ( \u201c Quad \u201d ) alliance \u2013 US , Japan , India , Australia .\nSuch legislative changes as the 2015 security laws serve to advance the transformation of Japan from constitutional peace state and civil democracy to national security state .\nThe 247,000-strong Japanese SDF constitutes an extension of the US \u2019 s own armed forces , trained , organized , and paid for by Japan but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes .\nThat they would ever act independently is unthinkable .\nFor Japan , the US alliance constitutes the highest level of national policy .\nUnder it the Abe ( 2012-2020 ) and Suga ( 2020-2021 ) governments have maximized war exercises , base construction , purchase of US aircraft , aegis destroyers , missile and anti-missile systems .\nFollowing the 2013 establishment of a National Security Council , the government adopted a series of laws concerning secrets ( 2013 ) , security ( 2015 ) , conspiracy ( 2017 ) , drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage ( 2021 ) .\nThis last , the Tochi kiseiho land control law , adopted in June 2021 , has been compared by some to the pre-war Japanese land control system .\nUnder it , \u201c observation areas \u201d are to be designated in the vicinity of major installations ( military bases , nuclear power plants , major communications posts ) for surveillance and control .\nOkinawans in particular suspect that they are to be prime targets for the legislation , in the attempt to constrict and control their anti-base movement .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough \u2013 have been muted by the huge arms purchases for which Japan can be relied on ( most recently the purchase for about $ 23 billion of 105 F-35B aircraft , bringing Japan \u2019 s Air SDF force to 147 .\nIncreasingly , the US forces stationed in Japan work alongside their Japanese opposite numbers as part of a unified US-Japan force , under US command .\nA global coalition of the willing currently takes shape , united under the US leadership in resolve to stop China in its tracks and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThe tempo of military exercises ( war games ) in East Asia accelerates .\nJust between January and May 2021 , Japan \u2019 s Maritime SDF ( MSDF ) participated in multi-lateral , multi-national exercises on 23 occasions , nearly once-a-week.9 Over the last twelve months , major exercises included those in the following table : 9,000 service members of US Navy/AirForce/Army/Marine Corps , together with 37,000 Japanese SDF members .\nIn waters around Okinawa , Japan Participation by the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier , Charles de

possibly even triggered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty over the tiny and uninhabited ( uninhabitable ) Senkaku/Diaoyu islands .\nIt beggars the imagination that the world \u2019 s \u201c great powers \u201d ( US , UK , Japan , France and , on the other side , China ) should be so intent on pressing conflicting claims to Senkaku \u2019 s windswept rocks as to risk regional and global peace for them .\nWhile Japan spends lavishly on refurbishing and strengthening the existing East China Sea base structure , especially in Okinawa , it also concentrates on plugging \u201c gaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain of islands between Kyushu and Taiwan so as , potentially , to block access for Chinese vessels , both military and civil , to and from the Pacific .\nThe view of China as threat dates to Democratic Party national governments 2009-2011 .\nThe National Defence Program Outlines adopted by Cabinet in December 2010 identified the military modernization of China as part of the \u201c security environment surrounding Japan \u201d and outlined a \u201c dynamic defence force \u201d to substitute for the existing \u201c basic defence force \u201d concept .\nIn August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to deploy units of SDF to close \u201c windows of deterrence \u201d against China .\nBy late 2012 , defence of the South-Western islands was accorded \u201c the highest priority.\n\u201d Under Abe and Suga from December 2012 the LDP simply reinforced this posture .\nThis view of China as \u201c threat \u201d has undoubtedly gathered force in Japan , and , accompanying it , the belief in the Foreign Ministry and on the part of recent governments , that such \u201c threat , \u201d can only be met by confronting China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taking every possible step to tie the US to such measures .\nBut such thinking is far from universal in Tokyo .\nThe extremism of the US policy resolve to oppose not just China \u2019 s military but China \u2019 s very existence and its rise as a global economic powerhouse , is probably not widely shared in Japan .\nMany insist that somehow an accommodation has to be found because the two countries are bound by history and geography and the alternative would be unimaginably disastrous .\nA Xi Jinping visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abe government had to postponed indefinitely because of COVID .\nSuch a visit was high on the priority list for Kishida even before he took office .\nThere is no doubt that Japan views China \u2019 s growth with deep concern .\nChina \u2019 s GDP , one-quarter that of Japan in 1991 surpassed it in 2001 and trebled it in 2018.14 Prominent public intellectual Terashima Jitsuro , in calling for an injection of realism to Japan \u2019 s policy debate , points out that US-China trade as of 2020 ( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times US-Japan trade ( $ 183 billion ) .15 and that the Japan that constituted 17.9 percent of global GDP as of 1994 had shrunk , relatively , to 6 per cent as of 2020 , while China had passed 18 per cent already around 2016 and was headed ( according to the OECD ) for a probable 27 per cent during the 2030s16 The clock will not easily be turned back .\nTerashima sees the alliance system design to curtail this trajectory and \u201c de-couple \u201d China from the regional and global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disastrous .\nWhether such realism can penetrate policy-making circles in Tokyo remains to be seen .\nThe pace of change in accord with the \u201c China threat \u201d scenario picked up significantly over the past decade as Abe and Suga added multiple SDF missile and coastal surveillance units to the islands of Amami , Miyako , Ishigaki , and Yonaguni , while planning also a completely new comprehensive SDF base on the island of Mage , in Nishinoomote City about 110 kilometers south of Kagoshima City .\nMage Island , 8.5 kms2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units of all three Japanese services ( 150-200 personnel ) , also hosting FCLP ( Field Carrier Landing Practice ) for US carrier-based fighter jets .\nHowever , although the national government purchased the island from its private owners in 2019 and announced plans for its military development ( two runways , harbour , ammunition storage , refuelling , and maintenance facilities ) , local opposition is strong .\nNishinoomote City elected an anti-base mayor in 2017 and re-elected him in 2021 .\nAs of late 2021 the standoff between Tokyo and Nishinoomote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kms2 , population 48,000 , 500\u2013600-person surface to air/ship missile force , under construction from 2019 .\nThe SDF becomes in the process not so much a national defense unit as a component of the US-led global anti-China coalition , its security and missile forces on the smaller islands complementing the existing US military concentrations on Okinawa Island , especially the US Air Force at Kadena and the Marine Corps at Futenma .\nIf Sino-Japanese hostilities were to break out it would most likely happen in the waters of the East China Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Japan acting to bottle Chinese forces up within the First Chinese defensive line .\nThat of course would be an act of war .\nThe world was transfixed in August 2021 by the spectacle of the global super-power , commanding a huge multinational coalition armed with every weapon imaginable , being driven from Kabul by a ragged band of religious fanatics armed with AK-47s .\nIf in the global system it dominated the US could be driven ignominiously from a state in which it had invested so much , then no state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security guarantee .\nIf there is a Kabul message to the world , it might be : \u201c Client States , Beware.\n\u201d While the shock waves continued from the American retreat from Kabul , a different kind of shock spread from the simultaneous announcement in Washington , London , and Canberra of the AUKUS agreement to transfer American or British nuclear submarine technology ( and at some future if indefinite point probably between 2040 and 2060 , actual submarines ) to Australia.17 The announcement of this fresh Anglo-Saxon coalition must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it implied a two-level structure of clientelist order , with Australia a quasi-nuclear state one rung higher and closer to Washington .\nIn the minds of Abe and his associates , undoubtedly , was the question : if Australia can have nuclear submarines , why not Japan ?\nKishida now heads what amounts to the third phase of the Abe government that began in December 2012 and continued in 2020\u201321 under Suga .\nAt its inner core sit the so-called \u201c Triple A \u201d of Abe and his closest associates , former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akira , the LDP \u2019 s Secretary-General , joined by Abe \u2019 s brother Kishi Nobuo as Defense Secretary and his disciple , the extreme right-winger Takaichi Sanae , as Chair of the Political Research Council .\nFor almost thirty years , since he first took a seat in the Japanese Diet in 1993 , Abe Shinzo has had a hand on the tiller of state .\nEven when he was not actually the head of government , his wishes have been treated as virtual commands under the principle of sontaku ( anticipatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasten to carry out the will of their superiors even before it has been expressed ) .\nKishida Fumio and Suga Yoshihide have been his faithful acolytes since 1993 and 1996 respectively .\nSince about half of the new cabinet seats have been given to novices , the policy influence of the handful of heavyweights \u2013 the \u201c Triple A \u201d at its center \u2013 is expected to be especially high .\nOn October 4 , when Kishida did as expected and called a general election for October 31 , support for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly thirty points lower than it had been when Suga took office a year earlier .\nHowever , that did not necessarily translate into greater support for the LDP \u2019 s opponents .\nWhile military-fist-ism advances it does so almost imperceptibly , without the social phenomenon commonly associated with full-blown militarism .\nThe general mood of the country is one of disaffection , not of any rush to war .\nAccording to various polls , the combined popular support for the opposition parties might be as low as 10 and no higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to attract a substantial group of the disaffected during the campaign to have any hope of forming a government .\nAs the Abe ( now Abe-Suga-Kishida ) stamp remains fixed on the face Japan shows to the world , voices attuned to the crucial and universal questions facing humanity \u2013 peace , sustainability , justice , equality \u2013 are scarcely to be heard in global fora .\nFor decades , the state they have headed has been conspicuous for its blend of nationalist bluster about Japan \u2019 s history ( including its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about state rituals centered on the emperor , and servility towards Washington .\nThe global outlook today might be even bleaker , more right-wing , more dangerous ( for Japan and the world ) , and even less attuned to a democratic , peace-oriented , and citizen-centered agenda than at any time during their ascendancy .\nHowever , opposition to the basic formula and priorities of the LDP-led Japanese state does of course exist and grow , fed by anxiety over the Abe government \u2019 s divergence from constitutional pacifism .\nThere have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national governments \u2013 in the 1990s and in 2009 \u2013 to contest military-first , client state agendas , but always thwarted by the national government for whom clientelist service of the US is unshakably paramount .\nContemplating the 2021 election the \u201c Civic Alliance for Peace and Constitutionalism , \u201d commonly known just as \u201c Citizens \u2019 League \u201d or Shimin Rengo , formulated a set of principles as part of a \u201c switch to life-affirming politics \u201d that was adopted on 8 September 2021 by heads of the major opposition parties ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic , and Reiwa Shinsengumi ) .18 This charter made no explicit reference to Japan \u2019 s client state status or relationship to the US , but its implicit message , through the call for reversion to constitutionalism and adoption of a peace-oriented regional and global role , was clear.19 The \u201c Citizen League \u201d currently mobilizes for a united front of opposition parties on peace and constitution matters , and for pursuit of the political and possibly criminal responsibility of recent governments on multiple issues .\nAnalysts point out that had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united front basis in the 2017 election they could have defeated LDP-Komeito candidates in 106 , instead of 43 , seats.20 In the forthcoming election a united constitutionalist slate could threaten even major front bench government members.21 Under Kishida , should he and others of the LDP old regime prevail in the October election , military spending can be expected to grow substantially .\nNo sooner had the election been announced than the LDP issued a set of policy pledges included a doubling , or more than doubling , of defense expenditure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level.22 The merger with US forces in an anti-China coalition throughout East Asian and Western Pacific waters can be expected to continue .\nEgged on by Washington , Japan would proceed further to ready itself for war .\nThe sort of realism advocated by Terashima would likely find it difficult to be heard in Kishida government circles .\nAlternatively , in the unlikely but not inconceivable event of a Constitutional Democrat-led coalition victory at the end of October , with party leader Edano Yukio in the Prime Minister \u2019 s seat the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window opened upon a different , truly alternative future .\nSuch a government would face the immediate test of its seriousness , however , when formulating policy beyond high-sounding generalizations .\nWill it announce suspension and cancellation of the Marine Corps construction works at Henoko on Oura Bay in Okinawa ?\nWill it stop and reverse the militarizing of the Southwest Frontier islands ?\nWill it call on the governments of the United

United Kingdom , and the United States ( AUKUS ) .\nWhile the deal includes cooperation in a variety of areas , the most eye-catching aspect of the cooperation is the sale of nuclear-powered submarines , a crown jewel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although AUKUS does not mention China directly , it is well-understood that China motivated the formation of this partnership .\nGiven the scope of AUKUS and its relatively long implementation timeframe , there are four ways to analyze Chinese reactions : threat assessment , nuclear nonproliferation , potential responses , and the regional arms race .\nThe Chinese worry about Australia obtaining nuclear-powered submarines , but do not consider the threat urgent .\nThey are concerned by the impact such submarines could introduce to China \u2019 s maritime domains , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBeijing , therefore , has focused on the deal \u2019 s geopolitical impact and attacked AUKUS , arguing that it is the product of a \u201c Cold War mentality \u201d among Canberra , London , and Washington and that it will undermine regional security and stability .\nSome have equated AUKUS with an \u201c Asian version of NATO , \u201d with the potential to expand to include other like-minded countries .\nDespite the severity of the challenge , there is also an impulse in Beijing to \u201c wait and see \u201d as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details remain elusive and consultations will take time .\nThe Chinese are not yet clear whether the submarines will be built , or whether they will come from retired US fleet .\nIn addition , Beijing believes that AUKUS might be scrapped by future political transitions in the Australian government , especially considering its high financial and strategic costs .\nThe fact that three former Australian prime ministers have expressed varying reactions to AUKUS leaves China with a sense of hope that this may not be a done deal .\nThe most stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its implications for nonproliferation .\nThe Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Vienna made a statement on September 16 on the deal \u2019 s \u201c undisguised nuclear proliferation activities.\n\u201d He called for the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to publicly condemn AUKUS , which , he claimed , demonstrates the \u201c double standard \u201d the United States and United Kingdom pursue in nuclear exports .\nAccording to a prominent Chinese arms control expert , director of the Arms Control Center at the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violates the mission and core obligations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in five different ways : \u2022 It contributes to the proliferation of a delivery system for weapons of mass destruction .\n\u2022 It contributes to the proliferation of fissile materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons .\n\u2022 It has the potential to lead to the proliferation of uranium enrichment technologies .\n\u2022 It undermines the NPT because it sets a bad precedent .\nTo be sure , AUKUS does not violate the NPT .\nIn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , section 2.14 , on the use of nuclear material in a non-proscribed military activity which does not require the application of IAEA safeguards , it is stipulated that \u201c [ n ] uclear material covered by a comprehensive safeguards agreement may be withdrawn from IAEA safeguards should the State decide to use it for such purposes , e.g .\nfor the propulsion of naval vessels \u201d ( emphasis added ) .\nThis , in other words , excludes nuclear-powered submarines from IAEA safeguarding requirements .\nAs such , then , China \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violates the spirit of the NPT , but not its letter .\nGiven the impact of AUKUS is not immediate , Chinese reactions will take time to manifest .\nAt present , China appears to prioritize understanding the scope and details of AUKUS and attacking its legitimacy for geopolitical and nonproliferation reasons .\nStill , in retaliation , some have proposed additional economic sanctions on Australia through trade .\nHu Xijin , chief editor at Global Times called for \u201c no mercy \u201d to Australia if Canberra dares to \u201c assume it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has nuclear submarines and strike missies.\n\u201d He has also proposed that China should \u201c kill the chicken to scare the monkey \u201d if Australia takes any aggressive military moves .\nIn the event of perceived attacks from Australia , this could mean that China will retaliate militarily .\nFor Chinese strategic thinkers , the real danger and core challenge of AUKUS ( and the United States \u2019 overall coalition-building in the region ) lies in the intensification of the arms race in the Indo-Pacific .\nAlthough Beijing considers that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset , or undermine US military dominance in the region , rather than targeting any regional countries , Chinese officials seem to be coming to the painful realization that their military modernization has led regional players to seek new ( or more ) weapons .\nPlainly , Beijing is realizing that its actions have contributed to a regional arms race .\nWhat \u2019 s more troubling for China is that this arms race is between China on one side and the United States and its allies and partners on the other .\nBeijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time .\nA formation of Dongfeng-17 missiles takes part in a military parade during the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People \u2019 s Republic of China at Tiananmen Square in Beijing .\nPhoto : Xinhua/Mao Siqian Equally upsetting for China is that this arms race is created , fueled , and supplied by the United States .\nStarting with nuclear-powered submarines to Australia , China believes that the United States will receive\u2014and deliver on\u2014rising demands from allies and partners in the region for newer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not nuclear-powered submarines ; South Korea , for one , has made this request for a decade .\nBeijing must decide if it should \u201c fold , \u201d \u201c call , \u201d or

had renewed its mining agreement with Australian-Canadian company OceanaGold Corporation this past July .\n\u201c We felt betrayed by the government who we thought was there to protect us .\nWhy did they side with the foreigners instead of us Indigenous people ?\n\u201d asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Didipio Earth Savers Multi-Purpose Association ( DESAMA ) , one of several organizations protesting the gold and copper mining operation .\nOceanaGold holds a \u201c financial or technical assistance agreement \u201d ( FTAA ) issued by the Philippine government , which allows a wholly foreign-owned mining company to operate in the country .\nIts previous permit expired in 2019 .\nThe successful renewal , which came despite persistent opposition from both residents and the local government , allows the mining firm to continue operations until 2044 .\n\u201c That will not dampen our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will not let all our years of struggle go to waste.\n\u201d Around 4,000 indigenous people living in the villages of Didipio and Alimit , in Kasibu town , Nueva Vizcaya province , have mounted strong opposition to the mine : first against Arimco Mining Corporation , which obtained the initial mining rights in 1994 , and then against OceanaGold , which acquired the FTAA in 2006 .\nOceanaGold \u2019 s mine claim spans 27,000 hectares ( 66,700 acres ) , straddling the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Quirino , some 270 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippine capital , Manila .\nThe concession is believed to hold 1.41 million ounces of gold and 169,400 tons of copper , enough to keep the mine running for another two decades .\nOpponents of the project say it threatens the local water system , which is critical to the community \u2019 s survival , to their agricultural livelihoods , and to the surrounding ecosystems .\nImmense volumes of water are used to process mineral ores , leading to both water pollution and depletion .\nIn addition , both open-pit and underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2015 ) can disrupt the natural underground water systems that feed springs and creeks .\nProtesters also decry what they say is the company \u2019 s disregard for the land rights of the Indigenous people , and the wide open-pit and abandoned untillable farmlands that they consider a permanent scarring of their natural landscape .\nSince the 1990s , Indigenous peoples in Didipio have resisted attempts to mine their lands .\nThe area was originally settled by the Indigenous Bugkalot , but was later occupied through peaceful agreements by the Tuwali and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ibaloy of Benguet in the 1950s .\nThis means that although they belong to recognized Indigenous communities , the residents are not regarded as ancestral domain holders .\nThis precludes them from asserting the need for a free , prior and informed consent ( FPIC ) process under the Philippine Indigenous Peoples Rights Act .\nWith a semitemperate weather , Didipio was an ideal place for rice and vegetable agriculture because of the abundance of water coming from numerous springs and creeks from the forest , Ananayo says .\nThe Dinauyan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , were not only abundant with fish but also nuggets of gold , which locals traditionally pan , Ananayo recalls .\n\u201c After tending our farms , we would go pan for gold which we sell to buy other necessities.\n\u201d But in the early 2000s , OceanaGold pushed through with its operation , despite resistance from the community and the municipal and provincial government .\nTo begin excavating its open-pit mine , OceanaGold demolished at least 187 houses in June 2008 .\nAccording to a 2011 report by the Philippine Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constitutionally mandated body , this demolition was violent and was carried out without the legally required permits or relocation and compensation agreements .\nThe evictions , the commission said , also amounted to a violation of the Indigenous community \u2019 s right to \u201c manifest their culture and identity.\n\u201d \u201c Some people were still cooking breakfast while others were still sleeping when Oceana [ OceanaGold ] bulldozed their houses , \u201d recalls Myrna Duyan , also a resident of

consider the probable withdrawal \u201d of OceanaGold \u2019 s FTAA due to gross violations of human rights related to the 2008 demolition .\nBut no official action was taken .\nInstead , by 2013 OceanaGold had completely demolished Dinkidi Hill , inverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then , Duyan says , the water systems across Didipio started to recede significantly .\nAs of October 2021 , Duyan says that at least a dozen water pumps and springs have dried up in the community immediately surrounding the mine , forcing residents to travel at least a mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) to fetch water for household use .\nOther residents have given up tracts of farmland , as there is not enough irrigation to sustain crops .\nDuyan says her own father was forced to abandon their farm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when water became totally scarce in 2017 .\nThe area where the water is drying up is part of the headwaters of the Addalam River , a major tributary of the Cagayan River , the longest in the

.\nDespite the constant talk of greenhouse gas emissions and the complete phase-out of coal , the disappearance of this fuel from the market would lead to the collapse of the global economy .\nIt is quite natural that the world \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , the USA , and Japan are among the most economically developed countries in terms of GDP .\nAs for Japan it once relied heavily on \u201c atoms for peace \u201d technologies in its energy sector .\nBefore 2011 , Japan had 54 nuclear reactors that generated about 30 percent of its electricity .\nHowever , after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 , Japan began a mass shutdown of nuclear power plants .\nSome power plants have been re-commissioned after safety checks , but many are still not operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants accounted for only about 5 % of Japan \u2019 s electricity .\nTo make up for lost nuclear capacity , Japan has dramatically increased its use of hydrocarbon energy in the decade since 2011 .\nSince the country is under the strongest influence of the West and has to share the latter \u2019 s \u201c green \u201d policy , Japan wanted to replace nuclear power plants with thermal power plants ( TPP ) running on natural gas , which is considered the most environmentally friendly type of hydrocarbon fuel .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own , and it proved to be too expensive to import gas in the quantities required to cover all the needs of the Japanese energy industry .\nWith oil , which is not as clean a fuel as natural gas is but is still superior to coal in this respect , the same situation occurred , as it turned out too expensive to fuel all thermal power plants with imported oil only .\nAs a result , Japan had to increase its use of coal and , since it does not possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports .\nIn 2020 , Japan became the world \u2019 s fourth-largest consumer of coal .\nIt would be in Japan \u2019 s interest to buy the bulk of its coal from Russia since Russia has vast deposits of this energy carrier and can offer coal of the highest quality that gives maximum energy with minimum pollution .\nHowever , Japan \u2019 s close relations with the West , with which Russia \u2019 s relations have significantly deteriorated in the past decade , and Japan \u2019 s claims to the Kuril Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of World War II , have played a role .\nTherefore , Japan \u2019 s top coal suppliers from 2011-2020 were Australia and Indonesia , with Russia ranking third .\nHowever , given the volume of Japanese coal consumption and the fact that Japan imports Russian oil and gas in addition to coal , this is a very high figure characterizing the magnitude of Russian-Japanese hydrocarbon cooperation .\nFor example , in 2019 , Russian coal exports to Japan totaled 20 million tons , earning Russia $ 1.9 billion .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West doesn \u2019 t go away and is only getting stronger every year .\nWealthy countries and corporations do not need competitors , they must be able to restrict industry and slow down other countries \u2019 economic development .\nThat is why Washington and Brussels are tirelessly pushing the environmental agenda on every possible international platform , making it one of the main topics at the UN .\nAs a result , in the summer of 2020 , Hiroshi Kajiyama , the Minister of Economy , Trade and Industry announced the government \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s 140 coal-fired power plants by 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions .\nIn the fall of 2020 , Japan \u2019 s new Prime minister , Yoshihide Suga , said in his first speech to the Japanese Parliament that his country is committed to achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions .\n\u201c Zero \u201d or \u201c carbon neutrality , \u201d which is so much talked about , does not mean that there are no emissions at all , but that they are offset by the green spaces that absorb carbon dioxide , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or company allocates to environmental projects .\nHowever , coal , considered the dirtiest fuel , should be reduced down to , or just above , zero .\nOf course , if it happens , Japan \u2019 s rejection of coal could have a significant blow to the budgets of all Japanese coal exporters , especially Australia , Indonesia , and Russia .\nWhether the Land of the Rising Sun will implement such an ambitious plan is a matter of lively debate .\nThe fact is that , according to Hiroshi Kajiyama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry , Japan plans to replace hydrocarbon energy sources with renewable energy sources ( RES ) , such as solar radiation , water , wind , etc .\nAlso under consideration is the possibility of switching to a new fuel , hydrogen , which is considered environmentally friendly because it does not emit harmful substances when used .\nAll this sounds tempting , but in practice , RES can not yet bring enough electricity to uninterruptedly supply a country with a large population and developed industry .\nHydropower plants depend on the availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country like Norway has managed to generate 95 % of its electricity through hydroelectric power , Japan does not have the same natural environment .\nIn addition , hydropower plants themselves cause significant damage to river ecology .\nAs for solar and wind power plants , they are , as mentioned above , too unstable .\nEuropean countries may serve as an example of this , such as the UK , which proudly reported in early 2020 that it could convert most of its energy to renewables , only to face an energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when many people were left without heating in their homes .\nAs a result , in the fall of 2021 , to prevent a repeat of the crisis , Europe began actively buying gas , which , although it gives less pollution than coal , still remains a traditional hydrocarbon fuel .\nThe massive purchase of gas has led to skyrocketing prices for the product , and as a result , even those European countries that are at the forefront of the global coal phase-out movement have had to buy and burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , both gas and coal reached record prices in autumn 2021 , and Russian , Australian , and Indonesian coal companies do not feel the lack of profit .\nThe author has mentioned earlier Japan \u2019 s desire to switch to hydrogen .\nIndeed , hydrogen does not pollute the environment when used .\nHowever , the environment is polluted during hydrogen \u2019 s production : surprisingly , most of the hydrogen produced in the world comes from the same oil and coal .\nOther ways of producing hydrogen on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , to avoid processing hydrocarbon fuel on its territory , Japan will have to pay a lot of money to other countries , and only later receive the finished product .\nIn the eyes of the United Nations , this may absolve Japan of responsibility for air pollution .\nStill , it will not make the number of harmful substances in the Earth \u2019 s atmosphere any less .\nIn general , the plans announced by the Japanese government in 2020 seem unrealistic .\nCurrently , coal-fired power plants generate more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid abandonment of coal in such a situation , as Europe has experienced first-hand , can provoke an energy crisis , the solution of which will require even more coal purchases .\nHowever , despite the loud statements of its leaders , Japan does not seem to be going to reduce coal consumption in the near future : from June 2020 to June 2021 , Japanese coal imports increased by more than 4.8 % .\nThe only truly realistic way for Japan to tangibly reduce its coal consumption is to switch to natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power industry , which was nearly destroyed by the Fukushima Daiichi Accident .\nNatural gas is too expensive right now .\nAt the same time , it could remain expensive for a long time : in 2020-2021 , Europe became convinced that it is too early to make renewables a strategic pillar of its energy security .\nHowever , a return to full coal consumption is also unlikely for today \u2019 s European politicians , meaning that Europe is likely to keep buying gas at high prices for years and decades to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch from coal to gas in Japan as well .\nThe future of Japan \u2019 s nuclear power industry remains unclear .\nOn the one hand , Japanese politicians have already admitted it can \u2019 t be abandoned altogether .\nOn the other hand , it may take many years to restore nuclear power industry to pre-Fukushima levels while simultaneously introducing modern safety systems intended to prevent a repeat of the disaster .\nNo matter how the Japanese energy sector develops in the future , it could be beneficial for Russia .\nIf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal , Russia will maintain the same volume of its Japanese coal exports .\nIf Japan switches to natural gas , Russia could become its largest gas supplier , considering the geographical proximity of the two countries and the fact that Russia is one of the world \u2019 s largest gas producers .\nRussia has long been exporting gas to Japan , and a considerable increase in those supplies will compensate Russia for its loss in coal supplies .\nIf Japan chooses to restore nuclear power , it will also indirectly benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidence in nuclear power was shaken in Japan and throughout the world .\nMany nuclear power plants have been closed in Europe , and many countries have given up building them .\nIf Japan returns to building nuclear power plants with new , safer technologies , it will signal to the world that the \u201c atoms for peace \u201d can once again be trusted .\nThen the Russian Federation , which is one of the leading suppliers of peaceful nuclear technologies , will be able to export them to more countries .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of energy globally , and those countries that pay attention to each of them will gain the most .\nHowever , traditional hydrocarbon energy will long play a leading role in the world ,

life that Koreans live with every day .\nIt continues in other ways too .\nU.S. President Joe Biden recently declared that \u201c for the first time in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at war .\nWe \u2019 ve turned the page.\n\u201d \u201c And as we close this period of relentless war , \u201d he continued , \u201c we \u2019 re opening a new era of relentless diplomacy.\n\u201d Was that the end-of-war declaration that South Korean President Moon Jae-in was waiting to hear ?\nWhen Biden made his solemn proclamation at the United Nations General Assembly on September 21 , 2021 , he was referring to the end of the US war in Afghanistan .\nSince the US military has withdrawn from Afghanistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer at war .\nThe Biden administration had already declared it would bring an end to \u201c forever wars \u201d in its national security strategy .\nThat included the 20-year war in Afghanistan , \u201c the longest war in US history \u201d by the administration \u2019 s count .\nThe Korean War , which has technically lasted for 70 years , didn \u2019 t appear on the list of forever wars .\nDespite Biden \u2019 s promise to end forever wars , the end of the Korean War was not mentioned anywhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Korean War doesn \u2019 t exist .\nNor is it part of his national security strategy to end it .\nConsidering that the war is not even referred to in his national security strategy , Biden is at least being logical that he does not need to mention the need to end it .\nThe day after Biden spoke at the UN , New York Times reporter Mark Mazzetti skewered the president \u2019 s speech.1 Mazzetti observed that Biden may have pulled troops out of Afghanistan , but he hasn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even in the Middle East .\nJust one day earlier , an American drone fired a missile at al-Qaeda forces in Syria .\nThree weeks before that , the US dropped bombs on the al-Shabab militant group in Somalia .\nThere are still 2,500 American troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria .\nMore than 40,000 American troops are carrying out operations in the Middle East .\nBiden himself has declared that the US can exercise military power whenever it deems necessary , including Afghanistan .\nMazzetti was right .\nThe US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mazzetti also got it wrong .\nHe mentioned several countries where the US is waging war , but the Korean War was absent from his list as well .\nThe US has been at war with North Korea since 1950 .\nIt continues to station troops in South Korea as part of that war , and not long ago , it carried out a joint military exercise with the South Korean military .\nAnd it continues to impose far-reaching economic and political sanctions on North Korea.2 Mazzetti \u2019 s not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bacevich is another , despite being critical of American military interventions in other countries .\nA West Point graduate and former officer in the US military , Bacevich , now the President of the Quincy Institute , spoke out against President George W. Bush \u2019 s invasion of Iraq .\nIn various books he has recounted American military interventions in numerous places since World War II , describing these as \u201c forever wars.\n\u201d 3 He conceptualized what he calls the \u201c Washington rules \u201d that bind the US to perpetual warfare.4 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references to the Korean War and does not pay due attention to the war that played a decisive role in establishing those \u201c rules.\n\u201d The Korean War reversed the precipitous fall of the US defense budget after World War II .\nThe budget has never returned to the pre-war level since .\nThe future of NATO was in doubt until the Korean War , which solidified it as a military alliance .\nJapan , which had been occupied since its defeat in World War II , regained its independence and formed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War under the US-Japan Security Treaty .\nRobert Jervis makes a prescient observation that \u201c it took the Korean War to bring about the policies that we associate with the cold war \u201d although he could not have anticipated , in 1980 when he wrote his analysis , that many of these policies including high defense budgets would remain in place long after the end of the cold war.5 While John Ikenberry describes the postwar order established by the US as the \u201c liberal international order , \u201d it would be more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on power , as John Mearsheimer argues.6 That defense budget , that military power , those alliances , and that international order are still in effect today with a hefty increase in the first Biden defense budget and a focus on China and the Asia-Pacific .\nEven if these corner stones of the postwar international order can all be traced back to the Korean War , neither liberal Ikenberry nor neorealist Mearsheimer mentions the historical origin .\nAnd none of the analysts mentioned above talks about the fact that the Korean War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer part of American public discourse : There \u2019 s no need to declare the end of a nonexistent war .\nIn this manner , the US is able to quietly maintain the world order .\nIs it possible that part of the \u201c Washington rules \u201d was perhaps inadvertently betrayed by US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Lambert recently ?\nWhen asked about an end-of-war declaration in a virtual symposium organized by the Institute for Corean-American Studies on September 23 , Lambert said the US didn \u2019 t want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n\u201c Our concern is that we not give a false narrative to the North that in any way shape or form , that would jeopardize our troop presence in South Korea or the ROK-US alliance.\n\u201d 7 South Korean President Moon Jae-in brought up an end-of-war declaration shortly after Biden \u2019 s speech at the UN .\nCould that speech contribute to pressuring the US to end its silence on the Korean War ?\nOr would it take another round of North Korea \u2019 s missile or nuclear tests , or worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of the war that they have been waging in a distant place ?\nAs it happened , Private ( Pfc . )\nKim Seok-joo returned to Korea the same day , after 71 years away.8 More precisely , Kim \u2019 s remains were repatriated that day .\nHe had been killed during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War and had been left buried\u2014or might have been just

Korea that could affect the outcome of the March 2022 presidential election , as one of the potential figures in the case is Lee Jae-myung , the ruling Democratic presidential candidate .\nThe fact is that a previously unknown firm , Hwacheon Daeyu , and its seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment as part of a project to develop and build up the Daejang-dong residential area in Seongnam City .\nLee Jae-myung was the mayor of Seongnam at the time .\nYoo Dong-gyu , former acting president of Seongnam Development Corp , was arrested on October 21 on charges of breach of trust for the project and receiving 350 million won ( $ 298,000 ) in kickbacks .\nThe loss estimate of the city made by the subsequent corporation management says 179.3 billion won ( $ 151.5 million ) .\nThis amount far exceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution charges against Yoo .\nThe firm also hired and paid astronomical sums to individuals associated with Lee .\nFor example , Former Supreme Court Justice Kwon Soon-il , who acquitted Lee in July 2020 for violating the Election Law , was paid 15 million won ( $ 12,600 ) monthly .\nThere is no direct evidence against Lee yet , but conservatives claim he was the actual owner of the company .\nIn addition , in their opinion , the investigation is being let down , and they argue as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who returned from the US after the Foreign Ministry threatened to revoke his passport , was not arrested .\nUpon his return , he was questioned and stated that he was removed from the project in the early stages .\nHe shifted the blame to other key figures , including Yoo and Kim Man-bae , the owner of Hwacheon Daeyu .\nNam also claimed to have heard his partners discussing raising 35 billion won to pay seven influential people 5 billion won each in bribes .\nHowever , only two people were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money at Kim \u2019 s request .\nBut after two days of questioning , Nam was released , defying widespread expectations that prosecutors would seek a formal warrant for his arrest .\nMeanwhile , it is believed that it was Nam who removed a clause from the contract that would have ensured an equitable distribution of additional profits between the city firm and the private developers and allowed Kim \u2019 s firm to get so rich .\nThe court only issued arrest warrants for Nam Wook and Kim Man-bae on November 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribery .\nSecond , the search of the Seongnam Mayor office did not take place until October 21 , more than 20 days after the investigation began .\nPrior to that , searches took place in less significant locations , giving the theoretical possibility of destroying evidence .\nIt was widely expected that cross-examinations would be conducted among suspects to verify contradictory allegations , but none have been conducted so far .\nInstead , investigators focused on finding details related to creating the profit-sharing system that paid significant dividends to Hwacheon Daeyu .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ general nominee Kim Oh-soo worked as a lawyer in Seongnam City before his appointment .\nAnd the prosecutor in charge of investigating the scandal was forced to return to his former post at another district attorney \u2019 s office after he called for an additional investigation .\nOn November 4 , the ROK media reported that law enforcement authorities discovered that just minutes before investigators searched Yoo Dong-gyu \u2019 s home on October 29 he had been on the phone with Jeong Jin-sang , the current deputy chief of the secretariat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigators suspect that the two may have shared confidential information about the scandal in the run-up to the searches .\nJeong admitted that he spoke to Yoo that day but denied any wrongdoing and criticized law enforcement for allegedly leaking details of the investigation to the media amid the presidential race .\nAs the scandal continues to escalate , Lee \u2019 s approval level is declining .\nIn a Korean Public Opinion Institute poll that pitted Lee against various conservative presidential candidates , the Democratic candidate lost .\nIn November , the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only conservative candidate , was nearly 10 percent .\nAccording to a different poll , 45.9 % of respondents are convinced that Lee Jae-myung is directly involved in the corruption scandal .\n17.2 % believe he is responsible for it , even if he did not receive a direct benefit .\n14.3 % believe that the scandal results from a sharp rise in property prices and has nothing to do with Lee .\n16.8 % shift the blame for what happened to the previous administration .\nA Gallup Korea poll also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support an independent legal investigation into the corruption scandal .\nIn comparison , 55 % suspect that Lee Jae-myung played a role in the project .\nHowever , 14 days after President Moon ordered a swift and thorough investigation into the scandal , Moon and Lee met .\nCongratulating Lee Jae-myung on his nomination as the ruling party \u2019 s presidential candidate , the head of state urged him to develop a relevant political program and run a fair campaign .\nLee Jae-myung said he is a member of the \u201c team \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Jae-in \u2019 s supporters to vote for him in future elections .\nAccording to an editorial in the conservative Korea Herald , the incumbent president , a ruling party member , has no reason not to meet with a presidential candidate from the same party , even if the president and candidate are from different factions .\nHowever , the meeting has a strong symbolic meaning .\nNone of the candidates who met with the presidents before have been under suspicion of corruption .\nThe Blue House and Democratic Party have warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this informal closed-door meeting .\nStill , the incumbent president is obliged to remain neutral in any election , and Moon recently suspended all meetings with ruling party lawmakers .\nIn this context , it is suspected that the parties have struck a deal \u2013 Moon will protect Lee from the scandal in exchange for Lee guaranteeing Moon \u2019 s protection from possible litigation after he retires .\nIn this context , the conservative media view the investigation \u2019 s position that Lee was not pursuing his private interests .\nThe scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fixed profit , allowing speculators to make huge super-profits , was a political decision .\nMeanwhile , \u201c few would believe that Yoo alone designed and executed the profit distribution scheme unilaterally without prior consultation with the mayor.\n\u201d In such matters , the city administration always has the last word .\nOn the other hand , there is still no direct evidence against Lee , although if

as it was one of the last to be colonized in the world .\nJapanese colonizers pushed a heavy-handed \u201c military policy \u201d , mainly because of the sharp resistance at their accession to power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass movements swept colonial and semi-colonial countries , including Egypt and Ireland , Koreans too rose up against Japan \u2019 s rule .\nStung by wide resistance by Koreans in March and April 1919 as well as general foreign reproach , Japanese leaders adopted a \u201c modern \u201d practice by starting the imperial \u201c cultural policy \u201d in mid-1919 .\nThe most important consequence of the cultural policy was the integral role Korean industry soon had in linking the metropole with hinterland economies , and it is from this point that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectonic capitalism that has influenced Northeast Asia down to the present .\nSeveral characteristics of Korea \u2019 s imperial experience distinguish it from other colonies.1 First , it was \u201c late \u201d in world time .\nKing Leopold of Belgium said in 1866 that \u201c the world is pretty well pillaged already , \u201d marking the violent spread of European colonialism across the globe .\nJapan \u2019 s annexation of Korea was almost half a century later .\nBy that time anti-colonial ideas and movements had spread , particularly in England and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with its colonial project when Woodrow Wilson issued his 14 points , calling for self-determination of all nations .\nA second characteristic explains why Japan and Korea have a shared modern history so daunting and unnerving , like fingernails being scraped across a blackboard .\nIt is because their relationship is more akin to Germany and France or England and Ireland , than it is to Belgium and Zaire or Portugal and Mozambique .\nGlobal colonialism is often thought to have created new nations where none existed before , to draw new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , out of a welter of geographic units divided along ethnic , racial , religious or tribal lines .\nBut all of this existed in Korea for centuries before l9l0 .\nKorea had ethnic and linguistic unity and long-recognized national boundaries well before the peoples of Europe attained them .\nFurthermore , by virtue of their relative proximity to China , Koreans had always felt superior to Japan at best , or equal at worst .\nInstead of creation the Japanese engaged in substitution after l9l0 : exchanging a Japanese ruling elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were either co-opted or dismissed ; instituting colonial imperative coordination for the old central state administration ; exchanging Japanese modern education for the Confucian classics ; building Japanese capital and expertise in place of the incipient Korean versions , Japanese talent for Korean talent ; eventually even replacing the Korean language with Japanese .\nKoreans never thanked the Japanese for these substitutions , did not credit Japan with creations , and instead saw Japan as snatching away the ancien regime , Korea \u2019 s sovereignty and independence , its indigenous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national dignity .\nUnlike some other colonial peoples , therefore , most Koreans never saw Japanese rule as anything but illegitimate and humiliating .\nFurthermore , the very closeness of the two nations\u2013in geography , in common Chinese cultural influences , indeed in levels of development until the late l9th century\u2013made Japanese dominance all the more galling to Koreans , and gave a peculiar intensity to the relationship , a hate/respect dynamic that suggested to Koreans , \u201c there but for accidents of history go we.\n\u201d Third , quite apart from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial great power support , particularly from Pres .\nTheodore Roosevelt .\nJapan got the empire the British and Americans wanted it to have , and only sought to organize an exclusive regional sphere when the other powers did the same , after the collapse of the world economy in the 1930s ( and even then their attempt was half-hearted , and even then the development program was \u201c orthodoxly western \u201d ) ; 2 In the first decade of their rule Japanese colonizers pushed a heavy-handed \u201c military policy \u201d ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their accession to power in the period 1905-1910 ; even classroom teachers wore uniforms and carried swords .\nThe Government-General stood above Korean society , exercising authoritative and coercive control .\nIts connections were only to the remnant upper class and colonial parvenus and even these were tenuous , designed to co-opt and thwart dissent , not to give Koreans a meaningful role in the state apparatus .\nThe Japanese unquestionably strengthened central bureaucratic power in Korea , demolishing the old balance and tension with the landed aristocracy ; operating from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county level and into the villages for the first time , and in some ways neither post-colonial Korean state has ever gotten over it : Korea today is still a country with remarkably little local autonomy .\nAdded to the old county-level pivot of central magistrate , local clerks and landed families , was a centrally-controlled , highly mobile national police force , responsive to the center and possessing its own communications and transportation facilities .\nFor decades black-coated policemen kept order and helped \u201c bring in the harvest , \u201d manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from paddyfield to middleman to storehouse to export platform , and thence to Japan .\nIn 1919 mass movements swept colonial and semi-colonial countries , including Egypt and Ireland , and Korea was no exception .\nWhat made Korea special was the nonviolent nature of the March First Movement , anticipating Gandhi \u2019 s tactics in India .\nDrawing upon Woodrow Wilson \u2019 s promises of self-determination , a group of thirty-three intellectuals petitioned for independence from Japan on March 1 and touched off nation-wide mass protests that continued for months .\nJapanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this revolt , and had to call in the army and even the navy .\nAt least half a million Koreans took part in demonstrations in March and April , with disturbances in more than 600 different places .\nIn one of the most notorious episodes , Japanese gendarmes locked protesters inside a church and burned it to the ground .\nIn the end , Japanese officials counted 553 killed and over 12,000 arrested , but Korean nationalist sources put the totals at 7,500 killed and 45,000 arrested .\nIt is also interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Japan \u2019 s other colony in Taiwan .\nEven after the rebellion in Korea and the watershed May Fourth Movement in China , an observant American traveler noted that quite a few Taiwanese wore Japanese clothes , whereas \u201c I can not recall ever having seen a Korean in s and kimono.\n\u201d There was a big \u201c independence question \u201d in Korea , he wrote , but \u201c Independence , if it is ever considered at all in Taiwan , is evidently regarded as hopeless , not even worth thinking about.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made about the differences between colonial Taiwan and colonial Korea was one official \u2019 s statement that \u201c what can be done with incentives in Taiwan must be done with coercion in Korea.\n\u201d 4 Stung by Korean resistance , Wilson and Lenin , and general foreign reproach , Japanese leaders suddenly understood that they were colonizers in the wrong century : wanting always to be \u201c modern , \u201d they found their repressive rule condemned as out of date .\nSo mid-1919 marked the start of the imperial \u201c cultural policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a distant day of independence .\nThe new policy inaugurated a period of \u201c gradualist \u201d resistance to colonialism , in which Koreans took advantage of relaxed restrictions on their freedom of speech and assembly to organize a variety of nationalist , socialist and communist groups , some openly and some clandestinely .\nNow Korean newspapers could be bought once again , and many other Korean-language publications appeared in the early 1920s .\nWriters like Yi Kwang-su became famous for novels in a nationalist vernacular , and others like Ch\u00f4ng In-bo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean history , examining the Tan \u2019 gun legend and the historical \u201c soul \u201d of Korea.5 American missionaries were divided in their judgement of the March First Movement .\nAll of them were appalled at the violence of the colonial authorities , but many also blamed radicals and agitators for provoking the violence .\nMost applauded the new \u201c cultural policies \u201d after 1919 , and echoed Japanese justifications for the new course .\nThe Resident Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church , Herbert Welch , wrote in May 1920 that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c some of the most intelligent and far-seeing \u201d Koreans \u2026are persuaded that there is no hope of speedy independence , and that they must settle down for a long period to build up the Korean people , in physical conditions , in knowledge , in morality , and in the ability to handle government concerns\u2026.6 This , of course , was Japanese Premier Hara Kei \u2019 s justification for the new \u201c cultural policy , \u201d to prepare Koreans \u201c in due course \u201d ( Hara \u2019 s words ) for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator , Nitobe Inaz\u00f6 , explained the rationale this way in 1919 : I count myself among the best and truest friends of Koreans .\nI like them\u2026 .\nI think they are a capable people who can be trained to a large measure of self-government , for which the present is a period of tutelage .\nLet them study what we are doing in Korea , and this I say not to justify the many mistakes committed by our militaristic administration , nor to boast of some of our achievements .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that Japan is a steward on whom devolves the gigantic task of the uplifting of the Far East , I can not think that the young Korea is yet capable of governing itself.7 Christian opposition to the Japanese is both a fact and a legend .\nThe churches were sanctuaries in times of violence , like the 1919 independence movement , and many Western missionaries encouraged underdog and egalitarian impulses .\nBut the post-1945 image of Syngman Rhee and other pro-American politicians as great Christian leaders and resistors to colonialism is false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyu-sik went to missionary schools like Pai Chai less for their Christianity than to look for political position through English .\nEnrollment at Pai Chai decline when English was de-emphasized ; in 1905 , within a day or two of enrollment , \u2018 half the school had gone elsewhere in search of English.\n\u2019 It is the humble among Koreans who have truly been drawn to Christianity : at the turn of the century , \u201c conversions among the 30,000 of Seoul \u2019 s outcast butcher class soon became \u2018 one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' \u201d 8 The hierarchy of Korean society pushed commoners toward the egalitarian ideal of everyone the same before God .\nThe largest split , however , brought Korea into the mainstream of world history after World War I : it was between liberal idealism and socialism , between Wilson and Lenin .\nLiberals had the advantage of association with Wilson \u2019 s ideals of self-determination , and the disadvantage that the U.S. was not interested in supporting Korean independence ; furthermore their social base within Korea was very slim .\nThe socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which targeted and walked off to jail anyone espousing \u201c Bolshevik \u201d ideas , and the advantage of a potentially large mass base and a spirit of sacrifice on behalf of Korea , so that by the end of the 1920s they were leading the Korean resistance movement .\nAs the leading scholar of Korean communism , Dae-sook Suh , put it , leftists and communists \u2026succeeded in wresting control of the Korean revolution from the Nationalists ; they planted a deep core of Communist influence among the Korean people , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peasants .\nTheir fortitude and , at times , obstinate determination to succeed had a profound influence on Korean intellectuals and writers .\nTo the older Koreans , who had groveled so long before seemingly endless foreign suppression , communism seemed a new hope and a magic touch\u2026 .\nFor Koreans in general , the sacrifices of the Communists , if not the idea of communism , made strong appeal , far stronger than any occasional bomb- throwing exercise of the Nationalists .\nThe haggard appearance of the Communists suffering from torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common enemy of all Koreans , had a far-reaching effect on people.9 By the same token , the 1930s were much more polarized than the previous decade ; Japanese put immense pressure on prominent Koreans to collaborate ; the tragedy of Korean collaboration can be seen in a person like Ch \u2019 oe Rin , a key leader of the March First Movement , who by 1938 was giving speeches lauding \u201c the Yamato people \u201d and \u201c the eternal , single-family lineage of the [ Japanese ] Imperial Household , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Yun Ch \u2019 i-ho accepting a position in the House of Peers , or the alacrity with which the leaders of business like Kim S\u00f4ng-su threw their lot in with the big Japanese zaibatsu and profited from the war .\nThese were people who would have been natural leaders of an independent and self-confident Korea , harbingers of a middle-class revolution .\nBut because of their collaboration ( under tremendous Japanese pressure to be sure , but then others continued to resist in spite of that ) the Japanese succeeded in compromising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite .\nOne of the longest-running influences of the March 1 Movement is also the least appreciated .\nIt convinced Japanese leaders to try and co-opt moderate Korean leaders and isolate radical ones .\nUnder the new \u201c cultural policy , \u201d Korean commerce began to grow .\nOne source argued for \u201c a tremendous increase in the number of Korean entrepreneurs , \u201d but by the end of the decade Koreans still held only about three per cent of total paid-up capital .\nMost Korean capitalists were still wholesalers , brokers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactions , with this activity mushrooming in the new ports .\nThe most important fruit of the cultural policy for Korean industry was the integral role it soon had in Japan \u2019 s \u201c administrative guidance \u201d of the entire Northeast Asian regional economy .\nNow Korea was to play a part in plans linking the metropole with hinterland economies , and it is from this point that we can date Japan \u2019 s specific brand of architectonic capitalism that has influenced Northeast Asia down to the present.11 Stefan Tanaka has argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mainland , in the discourse of t\u014dy\u014dshi ( Oriental or East Asian history , a kind of nativism ) Korea and Manchuria became mere \u201c regions \u201d , often lumped together as as mansen ( Manshu and Chosen ) .\nIf this had primarily a political-economic aspect until the Sino-Japanese War began , this concept soon changed into a \u201c metanational greater regionalism : \u201d for scholars like Hirano Yoshitar\u014d , t\u014dy\u014d could extend beyond the East Asian nation states , but was still to be distinguished from imperialism , where \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony.\n\u201d 12 Japan is among the very few imperial powers to have located modern heavy industry in its colonies : steel , chemicals , hydroelectric facilities in Korea and Manchuria , and automobile production for a time in the latter .\nAccording to Samuel Ho , by the end of the colonial period Taiwan \u201c had an industrial superstructure to provide a strong foundation for future industrialization \u201d : the main industries were hydroelectric , metallurgy ( especially aluminum ) , chemicals , and an advanced transport system .\nBy 1941 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 181,000 in Taiwan .\nManufacturing grew at an annual average rate of about 8 percent during the 1930s.13 Industrial development was much greater in Korea , perhaps because of the relative failure of agrarian growth compared to Taiwan but certainly because of Korea \u2019 s closeness both to Japan and to the Chinese hinterland ( see tables 2 and 3 ) .\nBy 1940 , 213,000 Koreans were working in industry , excluding miners , and not counting the hundreds of thousands of Koreans who migrated to factory or mine work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of mining and manufacturing grew by 266 percent between 1929 and 1941.14By 1945 Korea had an industrial infrastructure that , although sharply skewed toward metropolitan interests , was among the best developed in the Third World .\nFurthermore , both Korea and Taiwan had begun to take on semiperipheral characteristics .\nKorea \u2019 s developing periphery was Manchuria , where it sent workers , merchants , soldiers , and bureaucrats who occupied a middle position between Japanese overlords and Chinese peasants ; as Korean rice was shipped to Japan , millet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a classic core-semiperiphery-periphery relationship .\nAs for Taiwan , its geographic proximity to Southeast Asia and South China made it \u201c a natural location for processing certain raw materials brought in from , and for producing some manufactured goods for export to , these areas.\n\u201d 15 We see the kernel of this logic in the Government-General \u2019 s Industrial Commission of 1921 , which for the first time called for supports to Korea \u2019 s fledgling textile industry and for it to produce not just for the domestic market , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Korean goods would have a price advantage .\nThis was by no means a purely \u201c top-down \u201d exercise , either , for Koreans were part of the Commission and quickly called for state subsidies and hothouse \u201c protection \u201d for Korean companies .\nThe nurturing of a Korean business class was a necessity if Japan \u2019 s new policy of \u201c gradualism \u201d was to have any meaning , and this was in effect its birthday party\u2013although a controversial one ( three days before the Commission opened , two bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .16 That Japan had much larger ideas in mind , however , is obvious in the proposal for \u201c General Industrial Policy \u201d put before the 1921 conference : Since Korea is a part of the imperial domain , industrial plans for Korea should be in conformity with imperial industrial policy .\nSuch a policy must provide for economic conditions in adjacent areas , based on [ Korea \u2019 s ] geographical position amid Japan , China , and the Russian Far East .\nOne of the Japanese delegates explained that Korean industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in Tokyo , and would require some protection if it were to accept its proper place in \u201c a single , coexistent , co prosperous Japanese-Korean unit.\n\u201d In conclusion let me ask a question that rarely gets voiced : when all is said and done what did Japan get out its takeover of Korea ?\nWith the benefit of more than a century of hindsight , was it worth it ?\nEleven decades later , Japan \u2019 s relationship with the Republic of Korea is still fraught with issues left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate fate of the sexual slaves or \u201c comfort women.\n\u201d But what Japanese colonizer could have imagined another half of Korea , formed in 1948 as an anti-Japanese state , led by the colonial resistance , with which Japan still has no formal relations in 2019 and this country is now armed with nuclear weapons and missiles .\nThis is how colonialism produces utterly unanticipated nightmares .\nIn Japan , a unitary and free country , the unwillingness of most historians honestly to assess their imperial history is a constant insinuation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead .\nWith Japan \u2019 s record in China , perhaps there is some sincere reflection .\nThere is almost none in regard to Japan \u2019 s activities in Korea .\nThe twentieth century began with Japan \u2019 s defeat of Russia and its slow rise toward global stature , that , as it drew nearer , also drew Japan toward disaster like a moth toward a flame .\nEngland and America were the Pacific powers of the first half of this century , and they welcomed Japan as a junior partner but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to deal with lingering apprehensions about its ability to live comfortably with the rest of the world , and those apprehensions are nowhere greater than among its near neighbors .\nJapan is Icarus , running toward the sun .\nNote to readers : Please click the

an issue that the opposition has seized upon to criticise the government , resonates with Maldivians wary of outside interference .\nNew Delhi had donated two helicopters and a Donier aircraft to

forgotten the most basic natural law : reciprocity .\nWe can not extract and drill and harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back .\nFortunately , there is a way to approach agriculture that maintains a reciprocal relationship with the local ecosystem .\nAgroecology , to put it simply , is a farming that incorporates the principles of ecology so that agriculture becomes a means of giving back .\nA local jungle is a source of natural foods , medicines , fibres and energy sources , but instead of automatically clearing and putting it to the plough , we must recognise that it also cleans and conserves water , soils , regulates temperature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAnd , to circle back to climate concerns , importantly , that jungles capture carbon .\nManaging land , under the auspices of agroecology , entails revitalising a different kind of relationship with the soil .\nIt starts with understanding the principles of ecology and how nature works .\nDiversity , recycling , systems thinking , interconnectivity , and that the sun is the ultimate source of energy are just a few .\nAlmost Heaven Farms is a full-fledged permaculture training and design firm focusing on developing agroecology

the soil .\nWe put a man on the moon 62 years ago , but we still know nothing about the world below our feet , the soil in which all life comes from .\nThrough over ploughing , mono-cropping and the use of chemical fertilisers we have effectively killed all the life in the soil , from beneficial microbes to worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn killing the soil , we released massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and compromised its ability to capture the carbon back .\nAnd in this dead soil , we grow plants which are chronically sick and are not able to ward off pests and disease .\nPlants are completely dependent on chemicals for their survival .\nWe then eat these sick plants which give us little nutrition , and we become sick ourselves .\nSo , while others look to the sky for solutions ,

astonishing global deployment of personnel with admirable ignorance to theatres most of its citizens would fail to name .\nThe recent Taiwan fetish risks continuing this trend .\nAustralia \u2019 s Defence Minister , Peter Dutton , is a figure who has fallen head over heels with the latest , potential casus belli .\nKnown by the late and very mischievous Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is adamant that Australia will find itself at war over a bit of real estate whose history he has no knowledge of .\n\u201c It would be inconceivable that we wouldn \u2019 t support the US in an action if the US chose

pre-committing , and maybe there are circumstances where we wouldn \u2019 t take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can \u2019 t conceive of those circumstances.\n\u201d In saying that it would be \u201c inconceivable \u201d that Australia would not find itself at war with the United States over Taiwan , the unimaginative , already pre-committed Dutton received the attention of China \u2019 s Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian , who called his comments \u201c extremely absurd and irresponsible \u201d , the mark of someone \u201c obsessed with the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudices.\n\u201d Dutton \u2019 s execrable chest thumping was inspired by typically vague remarks from Australia \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the United Kingdom , submarines with nuclear propulsion as part of the new AUKUS security agreement .\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken , speaking at a New York Times forum earlier this month , was pressed , as previous occupants of his office have , on whether Washington would defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict .\nBlinken \u2019 s response had a bit of everything : dovish caution , chicken hawk pretence , hypocritical babble .\nThe Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 , which obligates the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-defence but leaves the issue of a firm security commitment open , shaped his initial remarks .\nMaking sure Taiwan had \u201c the means to defend itself \u201d was \u201c the best deterrent against any very , very , very unfortunate action that might be contemplated by China.\n\u201d This did not prevent the United States from lending a

rules-based order \u201d developed by Washington against those who dared challenge it , \u201c whether it \u2019 s China or anyone else \u201d .\nIn her November 23 speech to the National Security College at the Australian National University outlining the purpose of Australia \u2019 s foreign policy , Opposition front bencher Senator Penny Wong gave few surprises .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Labor Party when suffering in opposition , painful , even constipated caution , is preferred over clarity and conviction .\n\u201c We must expand the choices and options available to us , to enable

would \u201c join \u201d a war over Taiwan with Washington with no conditions .\nThis was \u201c wildly out of step with the strategy long adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Prime Minister Scott Morrison had avoided \u201c the same febrile language \u201d as his defence minister , Dutton was \u201c amping up war , rather than working to maintain longstanding policy to preserve the status quo \u2013 as advocated by the Taiwanese leader , Tsai-Ing Wen.\n\u201d Dutton , simmering and seething such observations , sallied with a rebuttal , encouraging all who cared to hear him that China-the-regional-monster was the problem , rather than his own particular lust for war .\n\u201c The Chinese Communist Party has a presence in 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d he stated .\nThere were

across the ocean .\nBefore much time elapses , Australian security forces are skirting off to restore order in their vast watery neighbourhood .\nIt is a reminder that such relations in the Pacific region are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , at times , plain scolding .\nIn the Solomon Islands , Australian interventionism was originally cloaked in shining dress , justified as humanitarian and utterly noble .\nBy the time some 2,000 troops , police officers and support personnel , mostly Australian , were deployed in 2003 , the country had already mounted regional interventions in Bougainville in Papua New Guinea ( 1997 ) and East Timor , the latter as part of a UN-mandated mission .\nThe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands ( RAMSI ) was given a rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d while easing Australian anxieties in a region marked by a supposed \u201c arc of instability \u201d .\nIn a conscious nod to making sure the mission would be seen benevolently , the PR pen pushers came up with the pidgin named Operation Helpem Fren .\nAt the time , Prime Minister Allan Kemakeza had to address certain concerns : Would his country simply become yet another staging post for other powers , or , worse , slide into the role of Australian puppet state ?\n\u201c This country belongs to all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s our country.\n\u201d This was only after a fashion .\nThe RAMSI mission only concluded in 2017 but it came with a new security treaty signed between Canberra and Honiara permitting the easy deployment of Australian force , defence and civilian personnel in the event of a national emergency .\nIn an environment psychically shaped by the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York on September 11 , 2001 and the grotesquely named \u201c Global War on Terror \u201d , Australian policy makers came to see terrorism everywhere and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next enterprising bomb maker .\nThis was the kind of torturous , and quite frankly criminal reasoning , that had justified the fictional links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda .\nThe new breed of Pacific Islander terrorists were reasoned like the Reds of Old , only these might be lurking behind coconut trees with heavy weaponry or found laundering money .\nIn the case of the Solomons Islands , such outfits as the Guadalcanal Liberation Army and the Malaita Eagle Force fit the bill , even if that fit was forced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed state in our region , on our doorstep , \u201d warned Australian Prime Minister John Howard in an address to the Sydney Institute in July 2003 , \u201c will jeopardise our own security .\nThe best thing we can do is to take remedial action and take it now \u201d .\nBut it was not always so .\nIn January 2003 , the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer , at a rare lucid moment , stated that , \u201c Sending in Australian troops to occupy the Solomon Islands would be folly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unconvinced by such need ; the exit strategy would be unclear and problematic and , perhaps most tellingly , foreigners did \u201c not have the answers for the deep-seated problems affecting the Solomon Islands.\n\u201d Within a matter of months , Australia found itself in an illegal assault led by the United States on Iraqi sovereignty and jauntily committing troops to the islands .\nHoward flew into Honiara to boast that Australian forces had secured the surrender of Harold Keke , who had been given the elevated historical standing of a warlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of an amnesty .\nHe stressed all those characteristics all architects of empire should keep in mind : rebuilding the local police forces ; \u201c attack \u201d corruption ; improve living standards ; and prosecute criminal , destabilising elements \u2013 according to the rule of law , naturally .\nThis month , the political classes in Canberra were again wondering what to do with the Solomon Islands .\nProtests calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare had led to civil unrest in the nation \u2019 s capital .\nA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound were set ablaze ; instances of looting and property damage were reported .\nSchools were closed .\nAgain , the divide between poorer Malaita and wealthier Guadalcanal , was spoken of .\nAgain , the politics of the provinces were being stirred by the politics of the central government in Honiara .\nIn this case , there was an added dimension .\nThe Solomon Islands had made a decision in 2019 to cease recognising Taiwan and switch its allegiance to Beijing .\nThe Premier of Malaita Province , Daniel Suidani , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national government .\nAn unsettled Sogavare , wishing to shore up his own sinking position , put in the call for Australian assistance .\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was not wasting any time in citing the security treaty to deploy Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police personnel .\n\u201c We have been watching the ongoing protests in Honiara with concern , \u201d he stated in a press release .\n\u201c We continue to call for calm , for an end to further violence and emphasise the importance of resolving tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 25 , Morrison rather unpersuasively declared that it was \u201c not the Australian Government \u2019 s intention in any way to intervene in the internal affairs of the Solomon Islands \u201d .\nThe Australian presence did \u201c not indicate any position on the internal issues \u201d of the country .\nIn such interventions , complex local factors behind agitation and unrest tend to be ignored as too complex for the briefing rooms in Pacific capitals and Canberra .\nThe obsession with security rather than dealing with specifically local issues , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local grievances , encourage the use of the police baton or the military rifle .\nGeneralisations become the norm , and , as Aiden Craney points out , propel narratives about the area being an \u201c arc of instability \u201d .\nSome digging is required before coming to a franker overview of such instances of meddling .\nJoanne Wallis , writing in 2015 , simply takes it as fact that Australia , \u201c the resident superpower in the South Pacific \u201d , and also allied to the United States ( its \u201c closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of responsibility \u201c for the South Pacific.\n\u201d In such attitudes civilization \u2019 s burdens are borne with Kiplingesque gravity , even if given the gilding of security .\nRudyard Kipling \u2019 s \u201c The White Man \u2019 s Burden : The United States and The Philippine Islands \u201d ( 1899 ) was yet another urging in the imperial argot , this time to the United States , to assume burdens and responsibilities in the Pacific .\nTheodore Roosevelt , ever supping from the cup of imperial sentiment , was unimpressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose .\nIn copying the poem to his friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , he remarked that it was all \u201c rather poor poetry , but good sense from the expansion point of view.\n\u201d Responsibility has often meant sticking your nose in the affairs of those swarthy barbarians whose understanding of civic institutions might be a bit sketchy .\nIt \u2019 s all done because they hardly know any better , and you have the self-interested answers in making sure such people are sorted .\n\u201c Australia , \u201d writes Wallis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , social and economic order , and ensure that no hostile power establishes a strategic foothold in the region from which to attack Australia and threaten allied access to air and sea lines of communication.\n\u201d That \u2019 s more like it : an honest statement of vulgar realpolitik .\nNote to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on

country of the Solomon Islands , has been rocked by thousands of people rioting .\nFor days , crowds of protesters flocked to the National Assembly and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare .\nThey also failed to burn the Parliament building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s residence on fire .\nSimultaneously , riots began to unfold in the capital and other cities as disgruntled people smashed grocery stores and houses in Honiara \u2019 s Chinatown in violence partially motivated by anti-China sentiment .\nSogavare appealed to neighbouring countries for help , with small teams of military personnel and police from Australia , Papua New Guinea and Fiji being immediately dispatched .\nThe total number of peacekeepers is about 200 personnel .\nAlthough this may appear to be a small number , it is remembered that the Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 690,000 people who are scattered across 300 inhabited islands .\nDuring the riots , three people were killed and more than 100 were arrested .\nThe country \u2019 s economy suffered a loss of $ 227 million , a huge blow when considering their 2020 GDP was only $ 1.5 billion .\nAlthough the unrest in Honiara has subsided , in parliament , the opposition is preparing to vote against Sogavare \u2019 s leadership and force his resignation through no-confidence .\nSogavare \u2019 s decision two years ago to establish diplomatic ties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taipei , has been a focal point of criticism against his leadership .\nDuring the rioting , a delegation from the most populous island of Malaita arrived in Honiara , which is located on the island of Guadalcanal , and expressed displeasure with the diplomatic decision .\nFor a long time , there were problems between Malaita Island and the central government , particularly over issues in the mining and logging sectors as they have created problems for local businesses .\nMalaita islanders felt that their interests were not fully accounted for by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged more strongly in the context of the economic crisis that arose in the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic .\nThe archipelago has been closed for nearly two years , meaning that foreign tourists and businesspeople do not visit , contributing to economic stagnation .\nAt the start of the riots , Sogavare blamed foreign interference over his government \u2019 s decision to switch alliances from Taiwan to Beijing for the anti-government protests , arson and looting .\nHowever , it is difficult to believe that the mostly subsistence agricultural people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather maintain diplomatic relations with Taipei instead of Beijing .\nThis is especially the case when the whole world , with the exception of 14 small United Nation member states , all adhere to the \u201c One China \u201d principle and maintain diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei .\nIt could be suggested that the political and economic elite of Malaita were coerced to protest against China .\nWith this in mind , it is certainly possible that Australia , receiving instructions from Washington , is trying to weaken the Beijing-friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s positions in the South Pacific Ocean .\nWhen considering anti-China alliances like QUAD ( US , Australia , India and Japan ) and AUKUS ( US , Australia and the United Kingdom ) , the emergence of anti-China riots in Honiara is unsurprising , especially as these two Washington-led blocs were established for the sole purpose of opposing and challenging Beijing across the Indo-Pacific region .\nAs the Solomon Islands falls

protest against the government and Beijing , Malaita \u2019 s Premier , Daniel Suidani , accused the Australian government of \u201c holding up a corrupt leadership \u201d by sending in reinforcements to help the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force respond to the riots .\nChina has officially expressed concern about rioting in the Solomon Islands and reminded that the \u201c One China \u201d principle can not be violated .\nHowever , the confrontation between the opposition and the Sogavare administration will continue .\nAlthough Australia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands , it has demonstrated how easily it can land troops in the country with impunity , a likely message towards Beijing .\nIt is also likely that Australia , on orders from Washington , will use its resources to ensure that an anti-Beijing government returns to power .\nIn this context , the internal political turmoil in the Solomon Islands will continue until at least 2023 when the next general election will be held

there was a formal attempt in the 1990s to prospect for minerals , including gold , silver and copper , which was denied due to noncompliance with requirements , according to data from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the country \u2019 s untapped mineral deposits , including gold , to be at least $ 1 trillion .\nBuntal said he recalled a mining company approaching his tribe for a potential open-pit mining operation on their ancestral land decades ago .\nBut the tribe refused , saying the forest and its watershed are the community \u2019 s lifeline and livelihood .\n\u201c We will not allow open-pit

to one of the child laborers , who said he typically carried four sacks of ore per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , passing through a river several times and navigating steep and slippery slopes .\nEach sack transported by foot weighs about 10 kg ( 22 lb ) , and at 5 pesos per kilo in pay , each child could earn 200 pesos ( about $ 4 ) per day .\nBut they weren \u2019 t paid for their labor , which led

ex-dictator \u2019 s son Ferdinand \u201c Bongbong \u201d Marcos Jr and presidential daughter and former Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte has rapidly emerged as a formidable tandem ahead of next year \u2019 s Philippine elections .\nHaving convinced Sara Duterte , a top potential rival , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcos Jr has emerged as the clear frontrunner to succeed President Rodrigo Duterte next year .\nThe latest surveys show that Marcos Jr is the preferred candidate of almost half of the total prospective voters ( 47 % ) , with Vice-President Leni Robredo a distant second ( 18 % ) .\nHaving lost the vice-presidential race by razor-thin margins in 2016 to Robredo , de facto liberal opposition leader Marcos Jr has wasted no time in consolidating a nationwide network of support .\nAmong his backers are former presidents Joseph \u201c Erap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A growing number of local government leaders and warlords across the country are also throwing their support behind Marcos Jr \u2019 s presidential bid .\nBut the only son of the former Filipino dictator could soon face a major hurdle in his plans to return the Marcos name to Malacanang .\nThe incumbent , who preferred his own daughter to run for the presidency instead , is widely expected to rally behind the charismatic Mayor of Manila Francisco \u201c Isko \u201d Moreno , who is now third in most recent surveys .\nAdding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are multiple petitions calling for his disqualification based on an old conviction for tax evasion .\nThe Commission on Elections ( COMELEC ) , which is packed with Duterte appointees , has yet to decide on the fate of Marcos Jr \u2019 s candidacy , which has the shadow of potential disqualification hanging over it .\nFor several quarters , Sara Duterte was the leading candidate in multiple presidential surveys .\nBut the Marcoses , in tandem with Arroyo , managed to convince her to abandon the race and join forces with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c grand coalition , \u201d which extends from the \u201c Solid North \u201d base of the Marcoses in the Ilocos region on Luzon island to the \u201c Solid South \u201d base of the Dutertes on Mindanao island .\nThe emerging coalition is now composed of major national and regional parties , including Marcos Jr \u2019 s Partido Federal ng Pilipinas ( PFP ) , Duterte \u2019 s Hugpong ng Pagbabago ( HNP ) , Arroyo \u2019 s Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats ( Lakas-CMD ) and the Partido ng Masang Pilipino ( PMP ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them facing charges of corruption and abuses of power , the Marcos-led coalition has been decried as a menacing \u201c cartel , \u201d which is intent on dominating Philippine state institutions .\nAnalysts believe that should the \u2018 grand coalition \u2019 emerge victorious in next year \u2019 s elections , they will likely overhaul the country \u2019 s constitution in favor of a federal-parliamentary system , making it much easier for dominant political dynasties to perpetuate themselves in power .\nWhat stands in the way of the cartel \u2019 s plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has lambasted the Marcoses for allegedly bullying his daughter to drop out of the presidential race .\nOver the past few weeks , Duterte has openly attacked Marcos Jr , a supposed ally , as \u201c pro-communist \u201d and a \u201c weak leader.\n\u201d On multiple occasions , the Filipino president raised the stakes by implying that Marcos Jr is a cocaine addict who should be disqualified from running for the presidency .\nIn order to thwart a Marcos presidency , Duterte instead pushed for his long-time aide , Senator Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him next year .\nLacking charisma and his own independent base , Go has struggled to make an impression on voters .\nA laggard in various surveys , Go has indicated he would withdraw from the race .\n\u201c My love for him is more than the love for a father .\nHe is old and he has given a lot to the country .\nSo I don \u2019 t want to add to his problems .\nI remain loyal to him and I promised to be with him for life , \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public event this week , spinning his expected withdrawal as a \u201c supreme sacrifice \u201d with due consideration for his aging patron .\nSeeking \u201c forgiveness \u201d from his own supporters , Go admitted : \u201c I was not ready for this \u2026 Perhaps it \u2019 s not yet my time to be president.\n\u201d With Go out of the race , the focus has rapidly shifted to Manila Mayor Isko Moreno , who has long been rumored to be Duterte \u2019 s \u201c Manchurian candidate.\n\u201d Back in October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d reports that he was the real candidate of the administration , with Go simply serving as a decoy .\nYet the Manila mayor began to rely on a growing number of Duterte administration stalwarts , including Lito Banayo ( campaign manager ) and Vince Dizon ( deputy campaign manager ) , who began to tweak Isko Moreno \u2019 s earlier more progressive language on major issues .\nIn recent weeks , Moreno has largely refrained from criticizing the incumbent , despite presenting himself as a potential opposition candidate earlier this year .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Manila mayor began to curry favor with Duterte , who faces potential charges by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) over his deadly drug war , which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in the past five years .\nWhen asked about the ICC investigations , Isko Moreno parroted the Duterte administration \u2019 s line by arguing \u201c we have existing , effective , at gumaganang ( working ) justice system.\n\u201d Like Duterte , he also began criticizing the international body , which recently decided to defer any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippine government to investigate matters through domestic courts .\nThe Manila mayor also promised to continue Duterte \u2019 s drug war , albeit promising to uphold human rights .\nIn the past week , Moreno also started attracting support from other top Duterte allies , who are opposed to the Marcoses .\nAmong them was Taguig City Mayor Lino Cayetano , the brother of former Speaker of the House and Duterte \u2019 s vice-presidential mate Alan Peter Cayetano , who has praised Moreno as the next potential Duterte .\n\u201c I love our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I saw in mayor Isko Moreno what I saw in mayor Duterte \u2013 fearlessness , \u201d Cayetano said , indicating growing support for the Manila mayor among key Duterte allies .\n\u201c Just on the first day , the way he cleaned up Manila \u2019 s streets , how he caught criminals , how he helped businessmen , vendors .\nYou see how fast he took action ?\n\u201d he added , raising the prospect of a well-oiled Cayetano-Duterte alliance behind the presidential candidate .\nFollowing Go \u2019 s announcement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet to be formalized , Moreno was quick to present himself as the potential candidate of the administration .\n\u201c If they endorse me , thank you .\nThank you in advance , but I will not preempt them until they say so .\nFor the meantime , I am always hopeful , \u201d a gleeful Moreno said , now anticipating massive backing from the incumbent , who seems determined to either prevent the Marcoses from succeeding him or to drive a hard bargain with his dynastic rival .\n\u201c I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the meantime , while I am expecting help , I will keep reaching out .\nWhile reaching out , I am learning a lot , \u201d the Manila mayor added .\nFor progressive statesmen , however , this is all part of a cynical ploy and set of ongoing negotiations between the Duterte and Marcos dynasties in anticipation of major changes next year .\nProgressive senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares lambasted the Go withdrawal maneuver as \u201c a desperate Machiavellian attempt to salvage the crumbling Duterte-Marcos alliance.\n\u201d \u201c May this serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek anointment from the president and his family in 2022 , \u201d he said .\nHouse Deputy Minority Leader Representative Carlos Isagani Zarate dismissed the latest developments as part of Duerte \u2019 s \u201c political playbook , \u201d whereby Moreno is \u201c just a pawn used as leverage to gain concessions \u201d from the Marcos camp .\n\u201c [ Duterte is seeking ] protection when [ his ] term ends \u2026 especially now that he is already considered a

poorest nations in the region .\nBesides the devastation wrought by US war with neighboring Vietnam last century which saw the US drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation on Earth in human history \u2013 the Laotian economy has also long suffered from isolation owed to its difficult geography .\nNot only is Laos landlocked , it features terrain marked with mountains , valleys , and rivers that have hampered even the most basic movement of people and goods within the country \u2019 s borders and beyond them .\nThis has recently changed through a series of modern highways also built by China bringing the 3 day

border to Laos \u2019 border with China taking only 3 hours .\nIn order to build the 422 kilometer China-Laos railway 75 tunnels and over 60 km of bridges were built , just to gain an idea of how daunting Laos \u2019 geography is and what Chinese engineers accomplished in building the new railway .\nThe railway is part of a much larger regional project which will eventually connect China and Laos to Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Thai leg of the network \u2013 featuring high-speed rail \u2013 is already under construction and regular rail already exists connecting Thailand \u2019 s cities and ports to the Thai-Laos border via the Thai city of Nong Khai .\nWith very little effort Laos \u2019 new railway can be connected with existing Thai rail networks before the China-Thailand high-speed railway is even completed .\nChinese-built infrastructure has enabled Laos \u2019 economy to rapidly grow annually .\nChinese-built highways coupled with the new railway , and future projects both along the China-Laos railway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 economy in ways it otherwise could not .\nA Bangkok Post article titled , \u201c Calls to speed up link to Laos-China line , \u201d would note : The cost of shipments from Vientiane to Kunming in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan will be cut by 40-50 % or US $ 30 per tonne , along with a 20-40 % cost reduction on domestic routes , according to a World Bank report \u201c From landlocked to land-linked : unlocking the potential of Lao-China rail connectivity \u201d .\nExports from Laos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 and could expand by about 20 % per year , a report by UN Comtrade has said .\nChina is also Laos \u2019 largest source of tourism with a direct link between China \u2019 s high-speed railway and the new China-Laos railway making it even easier for larger numbers of tourists to visit Laos , further enhancing Laos \u2019 economic prospects .\nLaos is being transformed from an isolated and impoverished state to an integral hub connecting East Asia to Southeast Asia .\nIn the process , Laos itself will leave behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosperity of its ASEAN neighbors .\nThe China-Laos railway stands to move Laos from chronic poverty to potential prosperity , thanks to an infrastructure drive that is itself a marvel of modern engineering .\nOne would think that alone should attract praise from around the globe and from the West first and foremost , a region and political bloc that poses as the globe \u2019 s patron of development and progress .\nYet in reality the West has enjoyed primacy worldwide precisely because its rhetoric regarding development and progress is deliberately empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay , arrest , or even reverse progress made beyond Western borders .\nThe West represents a fraction of the global population and in order to maintain primacy over the rest of the globe , arresting or reversing development is an absolute necessity .\nChina through its Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) has disrupted Western primacy by creating the infrastructure nations need to be prosperous individually and regions of the planet to be prosperous collectively .\nWhile for most people Laos \u2019 new railway is an exciting achievement and a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet another sign of its waning power over the world and the shifting of its once uncontested power eastward .\nArticles like The Diplomat \u2019 s \u201c Laos-China Railway Inaugurated Amid Mounting Debt Concerns , \u201d penned by Sebastian Strangio illustrate the West \u2019 s frustration and dismay as once \u201c third world \u201d nations obtain first world infrastructure .\nStrangio \u2019 s article collects a variety of vague and unconvincing concerns expressed by Western pundits over Laos \u2019 debt to China \u2013 as if they \u2019 ve \u201c discovered \u201d that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created debt .\nA cart before the horse argument is formulated claiming that because Laos is impoverished it will be unable to pay off the railway \u2013 failing to note that Laos is poor in the first place because it lacks basic infrastructure .\nStrangio \u2019 s argument is not unique .\nWestern headlines were full of similar narratives \u2013 apparently confident that Western audiences do not understand the long-term and indirect benefits massive infrastructure investment represents .\nSidestepping these otherwise irrelevant arguments is the heart of the West \u2019 s real issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laos is moving out from under the shadow of the West \u2019 s imperial legacy in the region and away from its various manifestations today .\nLaos \u2019 growing relationship with China also drives Western hand-wringing over the new railway , with claims suggesting China is all but taking over its small neighbor to the south .\nAt one point an Associated Press article would quote Scott Morris of the Center for Global Development in Washington who claimed , \u201c this is essentially a Chinese public infrastructure project that happens to exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides little if any benefit beyond China itself .\nFor ASEAN as a whole , the tangible benefits of doing business with China are obvious .\nConnectivity increases these benefits and as China rises the region rises with it .\nTogether Asia is surpassing not only the United States but the West in general

return to China they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeast Asia .\nIn regards to Laos , its economy is only achieving growth specifically because of Chinese-built infrastructure .\nThere is no reason to believe , and the West has made no convincing argument to suggest otherwise \u2013 that the new railway wouldn \u2019 t simply enhance this trend further .\nThe West Has Only Itself to Blame Strangio laments in his article that most of Laos \u2019 debt is owed to China .\nBut that isn \u2019 t because China is somehow preying on Laos .\nIt \u2019 s because China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able and willing to build the infrastructure Laos requires \u2013 be it rail or road .\nThe West had a multi-decade headstart over China but instead of building infrastructure across Southeast Asia during the \u201c American century , \u201d it bombed the region instead .\nThere are still an estimated 80 million submunitions scattered across Laos after America \u2019 s destructive war on Vietnam and its neighbors .\nThat works out to about 11 for each man , woman , and child who lives in Laos .\n20,000 people have been killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maimed which includes losing limbs .\nAccording to the Lao National Unexploded Ordnance Programme ( UXO LAO ) , 444,711 submunitions ( about 0.55 % ) have been destroyed between 1996 and 2010 .\nDespite the dangerous and exhausting work , eliminating 0.55 % of the 80 million submunitions still littering the country amounts to virtually nothing .\nThe Diplomat , in a 2016 article titled , \u201c Obama in Laos : Cleaning up After the Secret War , \u201d would claim : In recent years , US support for UXO clearance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIn response to steady pressure from NGOs like Legacies of War and their allies in Congress , US funding for this work increased from $ 5 million in 2010 to a record $ 19.5 million this year .\nThese resources , disbursed by the State Department \u2019 s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement , are used to support clearance efforts that destroy up to 100,000 pieces of lethal ordnance in Laos annually , employing 3,000 workers in the commercial and humanitarian sectors .\nAt 100,000 submunitions per year , Laos should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 1,000 years which for all intents and purposes means \u201c never.\n\u201d In other words , the US and its allies have an insurmountable task ahead of them just to clean up the mess they \u2019 ve made in Laos nearly half a century ago .\nThey also lack the ability or even the will to assist Laos in meaningful development including the building of essential infrastructure like roads and railways .\nThe West \u2013 as it stands currently \u2013 is organized solely around the pursuit of global hegemony in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of socioeconomic and technological disparity that made the pursuit of hegemony viable in the first place .\nAs the window continues to close on the effectiveness of the tools the West uses to pursue its brand of foreign policy , the resentment and

protecting the rights or reputations of others , national security , public order , public health or morals .\nWith such exceptions , authorities have vast latitude to clip , curtail and restrain .\nBut even then , Australia expressly implemented the machinery that would enable anyone in the country to enforce it .\nThe great stifling brake on free expression in the country comes in the form of draconian defamation laws that can be used by the powerful , the petty and the privileged .\nThe political classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism to silence critics , claiming that their tattered reputations would somehow be impugned by a comedy sketch , an angry social media post , or a hurtful remark .\nOne particularly nasty example of this has come from current Defence Minister Peter Dutton , described by the late Bob Ellis as a \u201c simian sadist \u201d , a pious detainer of refugees .\nSince then , we can also add war enthusiast , given his regular remarks about a willingness to send Australians over to die on that piece of land formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government proclaiming the importance of free speech , Dutton has , like other politicians , availed himself of the tools that undermine it .\nThat tool \u2013 namely , the defamation action \u2013 was used recently , with partial and regrettable success , against refugee advocate Shane Bazzi .\nIt is worth reflecting that the action took place over a six-word tweet posted on February 25 this year .\nThe tweet was flavour-fuelled with accusation : \u201c Peter Dutton is a rape apologist.\n\u201d It had been typed \u2013 as things often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : some hours after Dutton had told a press conference that he had not been furnished with the \u201c she said , he said \u201d details of a rape allegation made by Britney Higgins , a former Coalition staffer who has spurred a movement to redress Parliament \u2019 s sexual violence problem .\nThat comment , while seemingly rash , had rich context in terms of opinion , taking issue with Dutton \u2019 s characterisation of refugee women detained on Nauru as being the sort who were \u201c trying it on \u201d to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those were Dutton \u2019 s own words , noted in a 2019 Guardian Australia article mentioned in the tweet .\nThis legal action was merely one measure of the Morrison government \u2019 s general enthusiasm for trying to regulate the Internet and , more specifically , the effusive , often mad hat chatter on social media .\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison , no less , has called it \u201c a coward \u2019 s place \u201d filled with anonymous abusers and vilifiers , and has been on a crusade to make publishers of defamatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liable .\nDutton had also promised in March with menace that he would start to \u201c pick out some \u201d individuals who were \u201c trending on Twitter or have the anonymity of different Twitter accounts \u201d posting \u201c all these statements and tweets that are frankly defamatory.\n\u201d His government is also drafting laws which will require social media companies to gather the details of all users and permit courts to force companies to divulge their identities to aid defamation cases .\nThese regulations stink of advantating the powerful and political whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke .\nThey also point to an obvious purpose : reining in criticism , however sound , of the government .\nIn instigating proceedings against Bazzi , Dutton claimed in the trial that he was \u201c deeply offended \u201d by the contents of the tweet .\nHe claimed to be a paragon of veracity and accuracy severely misunderstood .\n\u201c As a minister for immigration or home affairs \u2026 people make comments that are false or untrue , offensive , profane , but that \u2019 s part of the rough and tumble.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line ; his comments were made by a person verified by Twitter .\n\u201c It was somebody that held himself out as an authority or a journalist.\n\u201d His remarks \u201c went beyond \u201d the acceptably rough and tumbling nature of politics .\n\u201c And it went against who I am , my beliefs \u2026 I thought it was hurtful.\n\u201d In court , Dutton outlined a series of measures he had taken as a minister to deal with allegations of abuse .\nHe created the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nauru to investigate sexual assault allegations .\nIt never once occurred to him that these initiatives took place on a problem of his own government \u2019 s making .\nIf you set up concentration camps on Pacific islands to allow asylum seekers and refugees to sunder , subsidizing client states to so , denigration and depravity follow .\nBazzi , through his lawyer , Richard Potter SC , claimed that the defences of honest opinion or fair comment applied .\nAccording to Potter , the honest opinion defence was \u201c a fundamental protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulwark of freedom of speech \u201d .\nIn Australia , such assertions would be going too far , given how difficult they are to apply .\nThe law firm representing Bazzi , O \u2019 Brien Criminal and Civil Solicitors , also made the understandable claim in April that the whole proceedings should worry us all .\n\u201c For a politician to use defamation law to stifle expression of a public opinion is a cause for real concern.\n\u201d In the public domain , individuals who had known a thing or two about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their puzzlement over Dutton \u2019 s response .\nHiggins , who is seeking redress for her own suffering in this matter , found the minister \u2019 s legal response to Bazzi \u201c baffling \u201d .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been offended plenty.\n\u201d Despite that , it still afforded \u201c people \u2026 the right to engage in public debate and assert their opinion.\n\u201d The whole case was a \u201c shocking indictment on free speech.\n\u201d From the outset , the Federal Court seemed , as much of Australia \u2019 s legal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Anglo-Australian culture puts much stock in the artificial contrivance of reputation , which is often a social illusion that says little about the conduct of the defamed individual .\nReputations are often false veneers fiercely protected .\nAnd so it came as no surprise that Justice Richard White was critical of the legal firm defending Barazzi .\nThe justice asked those representing the firm whether they were appearing as solicitors with obligations to be objective and independent , or as \u201c supporters and barrackers \u201d of their client .\nHe preferred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does seem to me that this should be a matter of capable resolution .\nThere are risks on both sides.\n\u201d In finding for Dutton in November , Justice White ruled that the tweet had been defamatory , and that Bazzi could not resort to the defence of honest opinion .\nWith classic , skewering casuistry , the judge found that \u201c Bazzi may have used the word \u2018 apologist \u2019 without an understanding of the meaning he was , in fact conveying.\n\u201d If this had been the case , \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the opinion actually conveyed by the words.\n\u201d Let it be known : if you do no not understand the meaning of certain words , you can have no opinions about them .\nDespite his eagerness to seek damages for all grounds , Dutton was only successful on one of the four pleaded imputations .\nClaims for aggravated damages and an injunction targeting Bazzi \u2019 s comments , were rejected .\nThe Defence Minister \u2019 s appetite for pursuing Bazzi for his full legal bill also troubled Justice White , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement .\nWhy had Dutton not sued in a lower court , he asked ?\nThe reason , claimed Dutton \u2019 s barrister Hamish Clift this month , was because his client was a prominent figure requiring a prominent stage to protect his prominent reputation .\n\u201c It would not be appropriate for the court , \u201d retorted White , \u201c to exercise their discretion more favourably to Dutton simply because of the important public and national office of which he holds.\n\u201d In stating that all were equal before the law irrespective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound point that those schooled in aspirational justice would appreciate but hardly believe .\nWhen it comes to Australia \u2019 s

visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on December 7 \u2013 the 80th anniversary of the day Japan attacked Pearl Harbor as well as American , British and Dutch forces across the Pacific , an assault that massively expanded World War II .\nThe visitors included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , but also two right-wing parties \u2013 the Japan Innovation Party and Japan \u2019 s National Democratic Party \u2013 that are newly empowered after the election for the Lower House of the Diet in November .\nThe mass visit \u2013 Asia Times has been unable to discover a larger recent visit to the shrine by politicians \u2013 makes clear how closely these two \u201c opposition \u201d parties are aligned with the LDP .\nThat alignment goes far beyond an attachment to a revisionist , \u201c Lost Cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War .\nAs Asia Times previously reported , the two parties are also bullish on beefing up Japan \u2019 s armed forces and revising Japan \u2019 s pacifist constitution .\nThis gives the ruling party added impetus in these areas , both of which are contentious among their neighbors \u2013 who , predictably , complained about the visit .\nThe rising nationalism may well be homegrown .\nBut there are also external factors in play .\nThe expanded strength of conservatives in the Diet indicates that increasing numbers of ordinary Japanese \u2013 cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful of North Korean missiles and irked by South Korea \u2019 s continued stridency about Japan \u2019 s historical misdeeds \u2013 support these trends .\nAll this suggests that deeper tensions are likely in the near future between Tokyo , on the one hand , and Beijing and Seoul on the other .\nThese tensions could become explosive : Northeast Asia is engaged in an under-reported arms race , with all players adding such weapons as missiles , stealth fighters and aircraft carriers .\nThose tensions are likely to further bog down Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo to operate together against Beijing in areas like the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait .\nIndeed , unconfirmed Korean media reports say Tokyo is preparing economic retaliation against Seoul .\nMoreover , the apparent snub aimed at the US suggests that Japanese nationalists are not as closely aligned with Washington \u2013 Tokyo \u2019 s wartime nemesis but post-war ally \u2013 as the latter might hope .\nThis explains the gleeful jeering in Chinese media and social media over the date of the visit .\nYasukuni Shrine is seen by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s millions of war dead \u2013 who include not just soldiers and sailors but also civilians killed in fire and atomic bombings .\nBut others point to the Class-A war criminals who are also enshrined among them , and the shrine \u2019 s museum , which promotes an imperialistic view of Japanese war-making .\nThe right-wing organization that organized the visit , \u201c Diet Members \u2019 Group Who Say Let \u2019 s Visit Yasukuni Shrine Together \u201d is chaired by former deputy speaker of the House of Councilors , Hidehisa Otsuji .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ group has visited the shrine since the autumn festival in October 2019 .\nThe group usually visits the shrine in spring and autumn , and on August 15 , the anniversary of the end of the Pacific War .\nHowever , for the last two years , the group decided not to visit due to Covid-19 .\nThe purpose of this visit was ostensibly , \u201c to ask the spirits of the war dead for protection from coronavirus.\n\u201d The visit sparked complaints from China , which was invaded by Japan in 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been colonized by Japan from 1910 to 1945 .\nReferring to the Yasukuni visit , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said , \u201c Rather than learning historical lessons , they only seek to revive the specter of militarism .\nThe Japanese side should adopt a right attitude , deeply reflect upon the Japanese militarism \u2019 s fascist atrocities and crimes against humanity and win trust from people around the world with concrete actions.\n\u201d South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Choi Young-sam expressed \u201c deep concern and regret \u201d over the facilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and invasions .\nEarlier , on October 17 , the ministry made similar statements after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida sent an offering to the shrine .\nWhat was surprising about the visit was not just the size of the lawmakers \u2019 delegation , and its multi-party makeup , but also the date : December 7 .\nThe date is the 80thanniversary of the Japanese naval air strike on Pearl Harbor naval base that bought the United States into World War II .\nWhile that attack was only one element in a superbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also hit British forces in then-Malaya , Dutch forces in the then-East Indies , and US forces in the Philippines , it is Pearl Harbor that has become enshrined in public memory .\nUS ships burn amid the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .\nImage : Wikimedia Commons Due to the time difference across such vast geographies , the attack on Pearl Harbor actually took place on December 8 , Japan-time , but in the US it was December 7 .\nThe latter date has become enshrined in most histories .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deliberate snub to the US , orchestrated by the growing radical revisionist right-wing elements in the Diet \u2013 or just ( insensitive ) business as usual .\nThough the Barack Obama administration was critical of Japanese prime ministerial visits to the site , Washington has this time remained silent .\nThere was no response on the US State Department \u2019 s website , nor did the US Embassy in Japan \u2013 called by Asia Times \u2013 offer any comment .\nChinese media and social media had no such restraint .\nOutspoken state-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spits on the US victory \u201d in World War II .\nDa Zhigang , director and research fellow of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at the Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences , told the Chinese newspaper that it was a \u201c challenge \u201d to the US .\nChinese social media users piled on , tagging the account of the US Embassy in China , asking , \u201c You seen this ?\nGlobal Times reported .\n\u201c Oh no , now the one who tags along stands up and slaps the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese netizen .\n\u201c What are you gon na do big boss ?\n\u201d The LDP is a broad conservative church , and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is widely considered a more middle-of-the-road figure than his two predecessors at the premiership , Yoshihide Suga and Shinzo Abe .\nHowever , there are doubtless pressures pushing him further toward the right \u2013 pressures manifest on December 7 .\nPost-visit , Otsuji breezily told a press conference , \u201c I am glad that I was able to visit the shrine for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to Kishida , who has not been to Yasukuni since he took the national helm .\n\u201c I know he has a desire to visit the shrine , \u201d Otsuji said .\n\u201c I hope he will visit the shrine at the earliest opportunity.\n\u201d If he does , that will be a turnaround by a premier .\nAfter the opprobrium that Abe caused by visiting the shrine in 2013 , he did not go again for the rest of his term .\nThat practice was followed by Suga .\nHowever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all when he visited the shrine after resigning the premiership .\nMore broadly , over the last 20 years , a range of Japanese politicians and opinion leaders have steadily walked back early admissions of guilt and responsibility for World War II .\nIn July 2006 , in a session of the Diet , Abe implied that the Class A War Criminals at Yasukuni weren \u2019 t really criminals at all and that a visit to Yasukuni was fine .\nIn 2016 , Suga made clear just before Abe \u2019 s visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay respects to the war dead , not to offer an apology.\n\u201d Central in this attitude is the nationwide conservative lobby group Nippon Kagi ( \u201c Japan Conference \u201d ) , which brings together influential members of society , such as media , business and politics .\nOtsuji is not just a member of the group ; he has served on its board .\nAmong the aims of the group is gutting Article 9 of the constitution , which prohibits Japan from waging war , and allowing Japan to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , offensive operations .\nWhile many in the United States would also like to see a more capable and less restrained Japanese military , they might be surprised to learn the animosity some members of Nippon Kaigi have toward the US-authored constitution , as well as its promotion of conservative , traditionalist gender and family values .\nSince 2006 , when Abe first became prime minister , \u201c throwing off the shackles of the US , \u201d has long been a goal of hard-right factions in the LDP .\nIn 2012 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constitution to replace the current post-war version , which the majority of Japanese still holds sacrosanct .\nNippon Kaigi also wants an educational system that will promote a distinctly Japanese identity .\nThat aim has raised accusations of blatant revisionism regarding historical touchpoints including the Nanjing Massacre and \u201c comfort women.\n\u201d For such conservatives , Pearl Harbor was not a sneak attack but a defensive action necessitated by the US and Europe denying Japan strategic resources .\nAnd at a time when much of Asia was colonized by Western imperialists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a war of liberation .\nSeen through a historical prism , there is no question that Japanese actions did , indeed , hasten the end of Western imperialism in Southeast Asia and India .\nHowever , this narrative overlooks Japanese prior colonization of Korea , and its awesomely destructive war in China .\nConstitutional revision is not simply about defense .\nThe LDP \u2019 s proposed new constitution , which includes an emergency powers act , would enable the prime minister to suspend civil rights and make laws during a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his 2013 essay , \u201c Japan \u2019 s Democracy at Risk \u2013 The LDP \u2019 s Ten Most Dangerous Proposals for Constitutional Change \u201d that it would \u201c reject the universality of human rights \u201d and possibly end Japan \u2019 s post-war liberal democracy .\nFrom 2009 , Abe , who remains an LDP kingmaker as he heads the largest faction of the LDP , was head of an extremist think tank and lobby group , Sosei Nippon ( \u201c Create Japan \u201d ) , comprised of LDP lawmakers and other conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sosei and Diet Members \u2019 \u201c Group Who Say Let \u2019 s Visit Yasukuni Shrine Together.\n\u201d Former minister of justice Nagase Jinenm at a grand convention on constitutional revision , held by Sosei Nippon in 2012 , declared , \u201c The people \u2019 s sovereignty , basic human rights and pacifism \u2015 these three things date to the postwar regime imposed by MacArthur on Japan , therefore we have to get rid of them to make the constitution our own.\n\u201d At the same meeting , Tomomi Inada , a former minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the country , the people must shed their blood .\nOnly Japan , which has dedicated itself to the imperial family for 2,600 years , is qualified to become a moral superpower.\n\u201d These kinds of comments , and the visit to Yasukuni , raise the eyebrows of scholars .\n\u201c One hopes that they went there to pray for the three million Japanese and some 15 million Asians sacrificed on the altar of ultra-nationalism in a reckless war initiated in 1931 by Japan \u2019 s ruling militarist and civilian leaders \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisionist exculpatory and vindicating narrative of Japan \u2019 s wartime aggression , \u201d said Jeff Kingston , an author and professor of Japanese studies .\nAnother scholar suggested that the visit was not out of context with those visits to war graves by Western politicians , whose forces have also fought colonial and expeditionary wars .\n\u201c They are signaling to conservative constituencies their respect for what in other countries would be regarded as a War Memorial site , \u201d said Shaun O \u2019 Dwyer , an associate professor in the Faculty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c That does not mean they are genuflecting to any State Shinto ideology.\n\u201d But , he added , \u201c It may be that a higher number of such conservative politicians embrace a \u2018 Lost Cause \u2019 ideology of Japan \u2019 s war of 1937-45.\n\u201d Koichi Nakano , an expert on Japanese politics at Sophia University , was uncertain about the motive and date of the visit .\nIt was hard to tell if it was a deliberate snub to the US , he said , noting that the Diet session had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parliamentarians were in Tokyo .\n\u201c I would say that there are not enough reasons to assume that it was a deliberate snub , \u201d he continued .\n\u201c They would easily do something like that against the Chinese or the Koreans , but they generally avoid antagonizing the Americans.\n\u201d As an example , he noted that the Yasukuni Museum \u2019 s display about Pearl Harbor was modified due to complaints from the US .\nBut he also suggested that the December 7 visit was making up for the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was made impossible due to Covid-19 .\nThe latter point is germane .\nWhile there are high-profile visits every August 15 , Yasukuni authorities prefer visits during the spring and autumn festivals , as they are not related to a single conflict .\nYasukuni is a shrine for all Japanese war dead \u2013 not just those from the Pacific War .\nThe controversial Yasukuni Shrine \u2013 where war criminals are enshrined , but which conservative politicians feel compelled to visit \u2013 is an emotive touchstone for both the Japanese right and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Coyner Another scholar noted that even within Japan , Yasukuni polarizes opinion but external criticisms are driving a nationalist backlash .\n\u201c Yasukuni is divisive in Japan but there is a legitimate view that regardless of whether or not it is wholly representative , there is this question of , \u2018 Why can \u2019 t we go ?\n\u2019 \u2013 it should be the national leader \u2019 s choice to visit , \u201d said Haruko Satoh , who teaches Japan \u2019 s relations with Asia at the Osaka School of International Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and points out that Kishida \u2019 s cabinet is not hard right with members from across a broad political spectrum .\nBut she frets that Beijing and Seoul are \u2013 ironically \u2013 empowering Japanese nationalists .\n\u201c People like Abe and elements of the right-wing are more to do with restoring the imperial state and all that nationalism , \u201d she said .\n\u201c But there is also a reaction to Chinese and Koreans harping on these issues .\nThere is apology fatigue.\n\u201d Korean vernacular media KBS reported this week that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically to South Korea \u2019 s actions , which include seizing the assets of Japanese firms to compensate those forced to labor during World War II .\nAsia Times has been unable to confirm this report .\nJapan \u2019 s position is that hundreds of millions of dollars were paid in compensation to settle this and other issues in 1965 and that the Korean courts \u2019 actions breach that agreement .\nBut beyond Korean-Japan economic squabbles , and beyond the domestic actions and aspirations of Japan \u2019 s hard right , real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play .\nHigh-profile politicians have opened a national debate on what Japan \u2019 s stance should be toward the defense of Taiwan , which is fast becoming a regional flashpoint .\nRegardless of the lack so far of constitutional revision , Japan is beefing up its self-defense forces with expeditionary assets , including marines and aircraft carriers \u2013 assets it has not held since 1945 .\nHaving given up on an Aegis-ashore missile defense system , Tokyo is mulling a first-strike capability against North Korea .\nAnd this week , as Tokyo invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prime Minister Kishida addressed the Diet on the issue of raising the national defense budget .\nThat followed the passage last month of a record supplementary defense budget .\nIn October , Kishida raised the possibility of doubling defense spending , customarily kept within 1 % of GDP , to the NATO standard of 2 % .\nWith Japan the world \u2019 s third-largest economy and already a global Top-10 defense spender , that would be huge sum .\nAmid these developments , Japanese nationalism and Tokyo \u2019 s increased defense spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , \u201d Satoh said .\n\u201c If they keep doing this , they will make it happen , as they are inciting this unnecessary level of Japanese drive.\n\u201d Note to readers : Please click the share buttons above or below .\nFollow us on Instagram
